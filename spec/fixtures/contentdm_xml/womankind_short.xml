        <pagetext>ERA  ERA supporters across the nation  breathed a well-earned sigh of relief  when Congress finally passed the ERA  extension.     In a 60 to 36 vote the  Senate pasied the amendment on October  6th.   The new deadline for Ratification of  the Equal Rights Amendment is June 30,1982.  Prior to final passage, ERA proponents were  successful in killing an amendment which  would have allowed the States, for the 1st time  in history, to rescind their earlier ratifications.  WOMANKIND  Many groups and individuals worked hard donating  money, time, and themselves toward getting the ERA  passed.   Now that Congress has passed the Extension, it  is not time to sit back or quit.   The most difficult task  lies ahead.   We must show the misinformed that the  ERA does Indeed offer mem what we have often heard  them say they want (i.e. equal pay and homemaker  benefits).  At first, many ERA backers stood separately   each  an individual in her/his own little world.   When  Congress continued to ignore the issue of women's  rights, ERA supporters began rallying together, showing  their numbers and their political power.  The Extension has passed; united Pro-ERA forces  fought and won that battle.   Yet, there is much more  to be done.   Those of us in ratified states must continue to give our support in every way we can.   We  must work to see that the unratified states become the  ratified.  It is time to turn to our co-workers and those we  have overlooked.   We need to show them the facts and  reveal the truth about the Equal Rights Amendment.   Too  many lies have been allowed to circulate and grow.  As Birch Bayh, Senate Leader in the fight for ERA said   I am hopeful that the 15 unratified states will recognize  that the Congress has stated clearly, through its recent  action, that this simple statement of human rights and  equal justice belongs in our Constitution.   With patience and with the same determination  women have shown throughout the ages, ERA will  become the 27th Amendment.  *    I      1  Write For WOMANKIND   WOMANKIND wants to publish YOUR essays, articles, poems, stories, cartoons, graphics, one-  liners, book reviews, etc.  Our only requirement for our contributors is that  they be female.

WOMANKIND EDITORS:  The enclosed profile article is the result of a two-hour  interview I did on a fascinating woman I met on campus  at the University of Maryland. A woman in mid life with  a retarded child and two other children, who without any  political experience or background personally affected  legislation in her state of Maryland.  As a result of her determination she went on to become  recognized as a leading advocate of the handicapped in  Maryland.  I realize that you do not pay for contributions;  however, I feel that women need to see that they are not  alone in many of the fears and obstacles they may be  facing.  A 31-year-old journalism student at the University of  Maryland, I am minoring in Women's Studies and have  a particular interest in returning women students. I am  currently beginning a study of returning women students  with pre-school age children.  Thank you for your consideration,  Sincerely,  Cynthia Goodenough -Lang  Breaking Out-  Women In Transition  by   CYNTHIA GOODENOUGH-LANG  The homemaker interested in starting a career faces  many obstacles in making the transition to a new role. A  certain determination is needed to meet the resistances  and to survive the challenges that lead to success; and  education is clearly an important factor.  Betty Jean Taylor, 43, of Oxon Hill, Maryland,  provides some insight into what it is like to leave the  home and enter the male-dominated arena of politics.  Her new-found occupation: Advocate.  Taylor grew up in the traditional South and raised herself and her brother from the time she was ten. After  high school she left her home in North Carolina and went  to Washington, D.C. to support herself as a government  employee. In 1952, at 22, she married and three years  later discovered that her 2-year-old daughter was retarded as a result of a bout with encephalitis.   IT WAS SO TRAGIC, SO PAINFUL,  recalled  Taylor,  I couldn't sleep for days or look at another little  girl without crying.  Another child was then on the way  and even another a few years later.   I tried to be a perfect housekeeper, but I was too independent to be a perfect wife; I changed 'obey' to  'cherish' in my marriage vows. I did a lot of sewing,  home decorating and a lot of cooking, but I was never  completely happy and I could not understand why. I  really worked hard taking care of the kids and runing  my house, all the while feeling this restless feeling inside, not wanting to say outloud why I was unhappy. I  totally subverted the notion that I had a right to do  something for myself.   The subverted feelings began to surface in 1970. With  all three children in school, Taylor, hoping to appease  that inner restlessness, decided to go on to college where  she says,  I was terrified. I realize now what a strange,  peculiar, backward animal I'd become by being isolated  from the mainstream of society. My first instructor was  sure I was either going to have an ulcer or a nervous  breakdown because I was so uptight about the course.   Asked what the course had been, she replied laughingly,   Geography   Taylor, by the way, got an A in  geography. As the A's rolled in, her insecurities and lack  of confidence gradually disappeared.  Betty Jean Taylor: Maryland's leading  advocate for the handicapped.  INVOLVED IN A HOT DISPUTE with the school  where her handicapped daughter attends, Taylor began  an intensive lobbying effort to pass legislation to correct  the injustices she perceived. She had a bill drawn up,  had it introduced, and through her lobbying efforts,  finally, in 1977, pushed Maryland Senate Bill 398 into  law. Her efforts were encouraged by her college advisor  and guided by her studies in a practicum seminar. As a  result of her studies at the University of Maryland and  her legislative efforts, Taylor is a leading advocate in  of the handicapped in the state of Maryland.  IN MARYLAND, MS. TAYLOR is Chairperson of the  Governmental Affairs committee of the Prince Georges  County Association of Retarded Citizens and serves on  its Board of Directors; a member of the Coalition for  Handicapped Children; the First-Vice President of the  Great Oaks Parent Association and has recently  received a three year appointment by Governor Lee to  the Maryland State Advisory Council for the coordination of Services to the Handicapped. Her goal is to  have a positive effect on policy and the decision-making  process which affects Maryland's handicapped citizens.  Betty Taylor feels she wouldn't be half a person today  if she hadn't gone back to school. She believes success  comes from  absolute, unwavering determination.   That determination is apparent as she speaks of her efforts to hurdle the remaining obstacles in what is essentially still a man's domain.  I see the social barricades  but lam not afraid of them. I just hope the obstacles  aren't insurmountable and if they are I will probably die  trying to overcome them.   Author:Cynthia Goodenough-Lang  DID  YOU  KNOW  THAT...

On my 45th birthday, I brought a miracle  home from the hospital. My son Paul was only  four days old, but he and I and our family  and WOMANKIND had already been through a lot  together.  After a dry spell of 20 years, the shock  and joy of being pregnant began to soak in.  After the amniocentesis results were in, and  after things began to look like we were to be  blessed with a healthy son (ah, modern  technology,) we,my husband, my 21 year old  daughter, and I braced ourselves for the  changes this creature would make,and was already  making. During this time, WOMANKIND was forced  to find a new location, in a time span of 10  days, and then we had to move, and then clean  and fix the place up (and it was an awful  mess ) Emotionally and physically, I was  drained. Yet, the prospect of having my second  child solaced me and gave me hope. I felt  there was a reason for this baby. A purpose...  perhaps his mission in life would be to unite  two families, to give love to all those around  him, and to brighten the world a bit. He  certainly would grow up differently, given his  set of circumstances,...and he would stand a  good chance of being a true male feminist.  In a gift poem, Martha Eubanks calls him,   small Paul, Apostle to the 21st Century.  I  wonder. And worry. But, for now I am caught  up in the wonder of him and these past six  months. It is not as easy as it was when I  23...  ycud. Cfiris-tcpk r Stewart  pCttS jCugor Ca?r uxt C  Sent, cj WCLUam   .

Even with all the problems during my pregnancy, I felt like I was holding so much  love within my anatomy that nothing else could  go wrong and when I went to press with Issue  23 on Sept. 27, 1982, age 44 and almost six  months pregnant, I knew I had overcome all that  had been put before me in the way of pain  and prejudice and impediments. I was elated  and after leaving the printer, I hurried to  a maternity shop to purchase some much needed  clothes. Then it was back to the office at  3447 Washington Blvd. to make sure all the  machinery was off, clean up the paste-up mess,  and make a list of the things that must be  done while the paper was at press. It was a  long list and I'm just now beginning to check  off those tasks that were supposed to be done  that week.  But, to that night...  At this birth, my daughter and my husband  assisted me as loving coaches and WOMANKIND  photographer,  Katie Niles,  recorded the  event in black and white.    At home,  my daughter  and husband share the diapering and the rocking  with me,  but it is still difficult to find  time and energy and space for WOMANKIND.    But  Contents  Womenews 2  At  Carnegie  Hall  3  Record  Review  9    Fake  Women  9  Fiction  7    Verse   5  Exp Jana tion  Before I stepped out from the lighted  landing of my basement office, I scanned the  parking lot as far as possible. Working since  I was 15, I had learned early to be cautious.  Now I was even more so. There was a maroon  and white car parked near the edge of the lot,  but it had been there all day. I exited and  quickly locked the door. Outside, as I walked  the 15 feet to my old green station wagon,  I enjoyed the early evening autumn air. It  soothed my flushed face. It had been a rough,  but wonderful day.  What a lovely springlike night,  I thought.  WOMANKIND was at  press, I was six months pregnant, all was  right with my world...   I slid into the car, locked the door,  and adjusted the seat to make room for my  stomach.  Too bad we don't have a tilt  wheel,  I was thinking as I pointed my key  towards the ignition. .  And then I heard running footsteps. A  black man was beside the car. His wild-eyed  face mouthed incoherent words as he furiously  tugged at the door handle. Something glimmered  in his other hand. I shouted at him:  Go  away  I'm not alone. There are people in the  house   He put something in his belt as he  bent over. I wanted to blow the horn; I wanted to get away,  i'm six months pregnant, I  thought, This can't be happening to me...if he  shoots me...the baby...will die.  I bent my  head towards the ignition. And then the night  exploded and warm blood cascaded over my face.  I knew immediately what he had done: he  had picked up one of the large black stones  that border the sidewalk and he had heaved it  at me. I was bleeding badly; I wanted to pass  out, yet, I was clear-headed. I realized what  might happen to me and my fetus if I lost  consciousness.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Ms Meg  by bulbul  Woman  for  V.P.  of  U.S.A.  A nationwide campaign for the nomination  of a woman Vice-Presidential candidate for  the 1984 Presidential election     for  both major parties     was launched in the  July issue of the LADIES' HOME JOURNAL.  Myrna Blyth, the magazine's Editor-in-  Chief, urged its more than 18 million  readers to fill out a simple form calling  for the nomination of a woman Vice-  Presidential candidate for both the  Democratic and Republican parties, and to  return the form to the magazine's New  York offices.  Blyth says the JOURNAL will pass the  petitions on to the chairpersons of the  Democratic and the Republican National  Committees.   We must make our leaders aware that  the could-a-woman-be-President debate is  outdated,  says Blyth.  if both political  parties were to nominate a woman for Vice-  President during the same election, the  woman-for-higher-office debate would  immediately evaporate. Moters would not  be voting for or against  a woman,   but  for the individual they feel is best  qualified, and for the policies that  individual believes in.   Editor's Note: Why Vice-President? Why  not a woman for President? WOMANKIND suggests  Eleanor Smeal, the past president of the  National Organization for Women.  STAFF  Wmv  m;ih    EDITOR  Judith LaFourest  STAFF  E.K.

Female  Farmers  on  the  Rise  According to recently released Census of  Agriculture results, one in 20 U.S. farms is  operated by a woman.  Judith Kalbacher of USDA's Economic Research Service recently analyzed the results  of the 1978 Census of Agriculture to determine the number of women farmers. This is  the first time these statistics have been  available, since this was the first census to  publish statistics on the gender of farm  operators.  They reveal that women are the sole or  principal operators of 128,000 of the  nation's farms, just over five percent. And  the numbers are rising. U.S. Department of  Labor figures show that the number of women  working principally as farmers or farm managers doubled between 1970 and 1980.  Kalbacher postulates that the number of  women farmers are probably, in actuality,  much greater than these figures indicate.  Since the census reporting forms allow just  one operator to be named per farm, it's  usually the man that's named by most farm  couples even though the woman may share  egually in the farm work and management responsibilities. When a woman is designated as the operator, it generally means  that she is the sole operator of the farm.  Considering this, there's a good chance  that a majority of the nation's farms have a  woman as one of the main operators.  from EARTH NATION  The Clearing   Nashville, IN.

Insurance Co. for Equality  Consumers United Insurance Company  (CUIC) endorses the National Organization  for Women's (N.O.W.) nationwide protest  against sex discrimination in insurance.   The question is not one of actuarial  data, but one of dignity. This is not a  debate over equations. It is one, rather, of  equality,  said Robert T. Freeman, Jr.  president of CUIC.  Freeman emphasized that the issue must  be resolved on moral philosophical, and ethical  grounds:  All American citizens  should be treated equally. We should  have one experience table showing the  over-all experience of all Americans and  not one for Blacks, not one for women,  not one for different ethnic groups or  any of the dozens of other ways Americans  can be sub-divided on arbitrary grounds.   CUIC supports premium rates based on  all-American experience tables for life,  accident, health, and other kinds of  insurance. The deviation from the  standard premium rates should be based  on sound underwriting practices that  include factors like life and health  styles, smoking and exercise habits,  weight, occupation, and other personal  choices that directly affect mortality  and morbidity tables.  CUIC, the largest worker-owned and  worker-managed firm in the country already  offers life and health insurance policies that  conform to the proposed non-discrimination  legislation now before Congress and is the  only insurance company in America that has  testified in favor of the legislation before  subcommittes of the U.S. Senate and  House of Representatives.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  NOW   in   Indy  by E.K.  BRAMBLETT  Indpls, IN  At a press conference in Indpls, Eleanor  Smeal (L.) congratulates Judy Goldsmith,  the new president of N.O.W. (Photo by  K. Niles.)  The National Organization for Women  held its 1982 fifteenth National Conference  in Indianapolis, October 8-10, 1982 to elect  officers, to plot strategies for the defeat  of New Right candidates in November  elections, to assist candidates supportive  of feminist issues, to urge more women  into political activism, and to raise the  NOW membership to over one million before  1984 elections.  Judy Goldsmith, of Wisconsin, defeated  four other contenders for the presidency  and took office December 1. Goldsmith was  the previous national executive vice president.  Her closest challenger uas Sonia John  son, a Mormon excommunicated for her  beliefs and actions supportive of equal  rights and feminism. Goldsmith won the  presidency with 1,157 votes to succeed  incumbent Eleanor  Ellie  Smeal. Johnson  trailed Goldsmith with 705 votes.  Other officers elected were: Barbara  Tirnmer, Washington, D.C, executive  vice president; Mary Jean Collins, Chicago,  action vice president; Kathy Webb, Little  Rock, secretary; and Alice Chapman, Danbury,  Conn., treasurer. Collins and Chapman were  on the Goldsmith team ticket. Gloria  Sackman-Reed (executive vice president) and  Katie Harris (secretary) were also on the  Goldsmith team, but failed to get elected.  Goldsmith, 43, a former English professor, began her affiliation with NOW  as a chapter activist in her hometown  Manitowac, Wisconsin. She named North  Carolina senator Jesse Helms as  NOW's  number one target in 1984. He is the  point man for the right wing. We see him  as a clear and present danger because of  his stand on reproductive rights.   Efforts by NOW to increase minority  membership will increase during her term,  Goldsmith promised.  A proposed NOW Institute for Feminist  Politics will focus upon the recruiting of  a  new breed  of candidate,  it's frustrating,  Goldsmith said, to constantly look  at the lesser of two evils. We want to  support candidates we can really feel good  about.  She also stated that NOW would not  devote itself to the ratification of the  Equal Rights Amendment  until we change  some faces in the legislatures.   Johnson was unquestionably the most  widely known of the candidates, having been  the focus of much media attention when she  was excommunicated from her church, an  experience which is recounted in her book  From Housewife to Heretic. She also re -  ceived much publicity as the leader of  thirteen women who went on a 37-day hunger  (Continued to page 4)  MEG/CRIS  by E.K.  BRAMBLETT  Indpls, IN  Olivia Records, the pioneer commercial  production company of women's music, presented two two-hour concerts in New York  City's elegant Carnegie Hall on November 26,  1982 in commemoration of their tenth anniversary. Olivia co-founders Cris  Williamson and Meg Christian were the featured  artists.  In buses and taxis, and T-shirts and  tuxes, women from all over the world flocked  to the event. One group of four evoked  applause from the crowd, which clogged 57th  and 7th Avenues. They arrived     in full  tuxedo gear     in a horse-drawn, shiny-black  hackney carriage driven, of course, by a  woman in a black tux.  Following a brief introduction by Olivia  president, Judy Dlugacz, a troupe of nine supporting musicians took their places onstage,  followed by Williamson and Christian. All  were clad in black slacks, white shirts, and  bright purple acetate jackets.  The concert began with a fast, exuberant  song entitled  Anniversary,  a spicy number  congratulating Olivia for ten years' existence.  A clever lyrical arrangement employed the  titles of several of Williamson's and Christian's songs which fit appropriately into the  song's message. Christian beamed with energy  bouncing ceaselessly. Williamson, conversely,  appeared happy yet subdued, somehow out of  place without her blue jeans and headband.  Next came an only slightly altered version of Margie Adam's  Beautiful Soul,   which was given an almost ethereal quality  with the harmonic merging of voices, standard  instruments, and synthesizer. The soft music  and lyrics were made yet more moving by the  warming of the stage with red, orange, and  yellow lights.  Christian's songs dominated the first  half of  the concert, beginning with  Can't  Turn Back.  She then introduced     to a  great round of applause     the lively and  humorous  Look Within,  a song of  infinite  wisdom born of painful experience.    The Ones Who Aren't Here  had listeners nodding in agreement with the introspective and touching lyrics, obviously empathized  with by much of the audience. Beginning  with,  ...I'm thinking about the ones who  aren't here, and who won't be comin' in late...  it continues, ...1 wish I could know all the  lovers and friends kept from gathering, I  think of you now, the ways you could go,  we're all of us refugees...so let's have a  song for the ones who aren't here, for the  hate and the fear, for laughter, for struggle,  for life...so let's have a song for me and  for you and the love that we cannot hide....  Williamson and Christian bounced to center stage after a brief intermission,,  sporting long-tailed black tuxes and white  shirts- Christian accented her formal attire with blue Nike tennis shoes. (Nike  is the Greek goddess of victory.) As Christian was featured in the first half, Williamson was in the second.  Following a pause after her first number,   So Good, So Right,  Williamson dedicated the  second song  Soaring  to her mother. As  usual Williamson used her voice as an instrument, augmenting the other musicians and  nearly sweeping the audience out of their  seats. Susan Freundlich, interpreter  for the hearing impaired, gave perhaps her  most beautiful and involved signing for this  piece, not merely signing the lyrics, but  also choreographing them into a small-scale  dance which held the audience entranced.  Another of Freundlich's splendidly choreographed numbers was for  Texas Ruby Red,   which Williamson explained was  not a song  about a grapefruit, but rather about a wild  rowdy woman of the Old West in today's world.   Preceding her fifth number,  Light and  the Eye,  Williamson turned her back to the  audience, set down her guitar, and donned her  trademark blue bandana while mumbling,   You just can't take her anywhere...dress 'er  up nice and look what she does   The number was  dedicated to  the mother Earth, the greatest  woman of us all, and to all the great spirits  who have been in Carnegie Hall.   Williamson and Christian regrouped for   goldie oldie time,  singing a medley of  eight of their favorite songs. Alternately,  beginning with Christian, the audience heard  segments of such hits as  Turning It Over,    Joanna,   Ode to A Gym Teacher,  and  Waterfall.    If I Could Only Win Your Love,  a  swinging country style song, preceded the  final scheduled song of the concert,  Song of  the Soul.  The audience in the darkened hall,  was nearly glowing from the energy and vitality brought to a spectacular level by the  combined thrills of two Williamson/Christian  concerts. Thus hyped for that final song,  some women sat and tried to absorb one more  number as if to hold each note alive  forever;  others stood and stared at the performers to  retain their images, and yet others stood and  joined wholeheartedly in the celebration in  and of song, hands joined and raised and  swaying with the music, further savoring  every aspect of the concert and getting in a  choral  thank you  to the performers, Olivia  Records, and each other.  Responding to the loud and prolonged  standing ovation, Williamson and Christian  pranced back onto the stage     whereupon the  ovation became deafening mayhem. As an encore  they sang  Ain't No Mountain High Enough,   a song uplifting musically and specially  meaningful in its lyrical imagery for those  who heard it that night.  Background vocal and instrumental assistance was given by: Diane Lindsay, bass;  Jeanette Wrate, drums; Judy Chilnick, assorted percussion; Adrienne Torf, piano and  electric keyboards; Jackie Robbins, cello;  Linda Tillery, Vicki Randall, and Shelby Flint  on vocals.  y OiflK  I For  UJ/  A  Kfc  T     Available at,  Making Olivia's  10th Anniversary Concert  the album of our decade.

Johnson's campaign booklet noted numerous  television appearances and speaking engagements. Johnson, 46, considered abortion,  Lesbian rights, and  the Feminization of  poverty  as the top three priorities of NOW.  Advocation of  radical  tactics and  the apparent expectation of immediate solutions to old and complex problems was seen  by many delegates and members to be  likely to damage the solidarity and credibility   and membership   for which NOW  has strived and earned.  During the convention's second day  plenary session, delegates honored their  outgoing president of five years Eleanor   Ellie  Smeal, to whom was given a large  guilt made collectively by NOW chapters  in all 50 states. Jill Chambers, a spokeswoman for Indiana NOW, guipped that the  guilt was  proof that women in NOW, indeed,  can sew . Smeal also.received the Indiana  NOW Woman of- the Year Award. Later Smeal  and her husband Charles joined hands in an  enormous circle of delegates about the  perimeter of the Indiana Convention Exposition Center's main hall singing,   We will never give up  We will never  give in    Later, in a speech, Smeal warned  against and  idealistic  approach to deciding which political candidates should receive NOW support, reminding people  to  look at the total picture. Look at  where they (the candidates) sit in legislative bodies and at who would be there if  they weren't.    Remember,  stated Smeal,  that some  people are more egual than others in that  they can influence more than one vote.  Someone, with seniority may not be with us  one hundred percent on every one of our  issues, but she or he may be able to block  someone else with an atrocious position (on  NOW's issues).    it may be better , she added,  to save  a person with seniority than to back someone  with no seniority who is one hundred percent  behind us. I am very, very worried that if  we (NOW) follow a purist approach, that  road will lead to structural weakness and  power weakness.

Authors Nora Ephron, Gerda Lerner, and  Pauline Kael were the major lecturers for the  series. Elizabeth reports her observations on the latter.  WOMEN IN THE MOVIE MEDIA  by ELIZABETH MARIE F0D0RA  Indpls,IN.  Pauline Kael, film critic for the NEW  YORKER, spoke to a group of about 200 at North  Central High School, Indianapolis. The critic  was met with warm applause, which was then  interspersed throughout her talk, along with  amused laughter. The concensus of the audience  was overwhelming approval.  The unpretentious critic, clad in a  bowed blouse and black pants, was introduced  as  a woman in the vanguard of achievements in  the arts and the humanities in out time.  The  introduction went on to say:  With her film  reviews, she has helped shape the study of  cinema as an art form and as an academic  subject as well.   The reviewer gave her opinions, feelings,  and mini-criticisms about current movies.  Kael talked of the discrimination experienced  by women because of the movies of today.  Kael  said women are portrayed as  spunky, fiesty,  tough little critters  in movies as a solution to a problem directors have about integrating women into the action genre films,  that traditionally glorify male strength.   Right now successful women in films are  not making films called feminist,  Kael said.  She believes that most women are breaking into films  via the exploitation  route the same  way men have all along.  Kael says that women directors have a   women's sensibility as to how to represent  certain scenes in a movie.  A woman will  simply choose to use a camera in different  shots to  see things you haven't seen before.   For instance, says Kael,  in FAST  TIMES AT RIDGEM0NT HIGH directed by Amy  Heckerling, you say a young girl's reaction  to her first seduction, and her disappointment. The camera was kept on the girl's  face to see how she reacted. That was a scene  that a male director would never have  thought of filming.   According to Kael, the movie depictors  generally deal with sexual experiences  because that is what the public wants, but   there are all sorts of aspects of women's  lives that have rarely been on the screen.   There is a whole scope of art which the  directors and producers totally neglect.  Kael can be described as witty, humorous,  candid, opinionated, and intelligent, also   arty  and talented.
