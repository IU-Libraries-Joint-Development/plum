        <pagetext>Page 2  WOMANKIND  Some Background And An Update On The ERA  THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT  TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION  Sectiont.     Equality   of  rights  under  the  law  (.hall  not be denied or abridged by the United  States   or   by  any  state  on  account  of  sex.  Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to  enforce, by appropriate legislation, the  provisions of this article.  Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two  years    after    the    date    of    ratification.  Author of:   Alice Paul  Year introduced into Congress: 1923  Years passed by Congress:   1972 (this took almost  50 years)  Deadline for ratification:  March 22, 1979. (h  took 72 years to get the right for women to  vote.   It took a Civil War to get Black men  included in the Constitution.  Indiana passed the ERA. It was the 35th state to  do so. But because this is a federal amendment, it  will not apply anywhere in the country unless a total of 38 states ratify it. Then it will become part  of the U-. S. Constitution.  In a recent major victory for ERA advocates, the  House Judiciary Committee voted to extend the  deadline three more years.   This was a compromise  since ERA proponents have asked for a seven year extension.   The Committee also voted that states cannot  rescind their ratification.   Experts believe the    decisions will easily pass the House.   Passage in the  Senate is expected to be more difficult.  The Constitution says nothing at all about time  limits for ratification of proposed amendments.  Deadlines are a new practice.   The first 17 a-  mendments and the 19th amendment (Women's  Suffrage) were added without any deadline for ratification.   The Supreme Court says Congress may  assign any  reasonable  time for ratification of an  amendment.  Time has become the strongest weapon for opponents of the ERA.   Repressive forces in unratified states have used stalling tactics and political  deals to block ratification.   Idaho, Nebraska and  Tennessee voted to reverse their ratification.   Ken-  How Will You Feel on  March 23,1979 if the  Equal Rights Amendment   is not Passed?

Washington, D.C. 20515  big sisters  n  How can we hope to break the chain of events  that leads pre-delinquent girls into early and often unwanted motherhood, prostitution, drug and  alchohol abuse, if there are no agencies to help  them... when they are growing up?  In an attempt to answer that question, Big  Sisters of Greater Indianapolis was established  in 1974; their specific purpose to  match   young girls with adult women volunteers and  encourage the one-to-one friendship that results.  To date, 428 cumulative matches between Big  and Little Sisters have been established and nurtured through the Big Sisters agency in Indianapolis.  Through the friendship that develops, a Little  Sister will often be able to cope with her future  problems when the adults one-year committment to  the program has ended.   Just as important, such a  friendship often introduces her to a social and economic world outside her own realm of experience  A Big Sister can often provide assurance that  there are careers and opportunities available to  women today that are worth the work and study it  may take to obtain them.  Little Sisters are referred to the agency from  several sources: by teachers, by family and by the  Juvenile Court system.   Big Sisters come to the  agency as volunteers.   They are from diverse  backgrounds.   They are 18 and older (no upper  age limit).   And there are never quite enough of  them.  Currently there are 90 potential Little Sisters  who need the services that only a woman volunteer  can provide.   The Big Sisters agency can give training, support and encouragement from their professional staff of caseworkers and administrators, but  the bottom line is always you... the woman, the  volunteer who cares.  For additional information about the Big Sisters  program in Indianapolis, please contact the agency's  headquarters at 615 N. Alabama Street, Indianapolis,  Indiana 46204, Phone 317-634-6102, Monday-Thursday 8a.m. to 5p.m., and Friday 8a.m. to 12 noon.  If you do not live in or near Indianapolis and you  are interested in this program, be assured that there  is probably an agency near you.

This is one of the reasons  there is so much coverage in this issue about the  Amendment and about die July 9th March on  Washington.  If passed, The Equal Rights Amendment will i  have an effect on all women--everywhere.    If it  doesn't pass, there will be such a negative effect  on all women--everywhere--that to try to imagine  it is impossible and degrading. Failure to pass the  ERA will mean that this nation has gone on record  as being opposed to full equality for all its citizens.  Women will continue to be second class citizens.  DID  YOU KNOW  THAT:  For every dollar a man earns, a woman earns  only 570.   A female head-of-household earns less  than 2/3 of what a male head-of-household earns,  and this gap is widening.  Women represent only 2  of the total secondary .  school principals, although they comprise 63  of the  public school teachers.  Women college professors earn, on an average,   3000 per year less than men college professors.  Without the Equal Rights Amendment, what  little non-discriminatory legislation there is can  be reversed, modified, or even eliminated.  If you believe in the ERA, make it a priority  this year.   If you are a non-believer, keep an  open mind and hear what ERA proponents are saying.  WOMANKIND writers are non-paid, non-political, and non-professional.  They want to share  information and ideas with other women.   Listen  to what they have to say.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 3  Pilgrimage  ington, D.C.  X*  o  i  On the Capitol lawn, 90, 000 assemble  In 1913, 8, 000 people, wearing white and carrying purple, gold and white banners, marched down  Pennsylvania Avenue toward the U.S. Capitol in  support of the Women's Suffrage Amendment.  On July 9, 1978, 65 years later, they were remembered by approximately 90, 000 people, dressed  in white and carrying replicas of the early suffragist  banners.   Making up the largest feminist parade in  history, the procession marched toward me U. S.  Capitol.   They marched in support of the Equal  Rights Amendment and the extension of the March  22, 1979 ratification deadline.  The Girl Scouts led the way from the mall adjacent to the Washington monument.   Women,  children and men followed, marching in unison,  a tightly disciplined array.  An antique trolley carried the handicapped and  elderly. It was dedicated to the memory of Anna  K. Wiley, an original suffragist who was jailed in  1918.  Blanche Austin,  an 86-year-old suffragist from  Pennsylvania rode the txoUey.    She once served as  personal secretary to Dr. Alice Paul, author of the  ERA.  A pony cart carried  Children for the ERA,    including Lori Smeal, ten-year-old daughter of  Eleanor Smeal, national president of the National  Organization for Women (NOW) which organized  the march.  One marcher wore a purple pin that had belonged to her grandmother, a school teacher  who had fought for equal rights.   Another wore  the petticoat of her suffragette mother.  One elderly woman, D.C. resident, Katherine  Heath said,   I've been fighting this battle for  30 odd years.   That's why I'm so decrepit, I  can't walk.    I had to meet them here,   she  said as she stood on the sidewalk and watched  the parade pass.   Occasionally she joined in  the  ERA now  chants or raised her fist in  support.  Several area bands, dance troups and a  mime group enlivened the march as it  stretched from the Washington Monument to  the Capitol and the numbers kept coming.  Many participants sang songs, including the  traditional  Bread and Roses,   a verse of which  follows:  As we come marching, marching, we  battle too for men, For they are women's  children, and we mother them again;  Our lives shall not be sweated from birth  until life closes; Hearts can starve aa well  as bodies; give us bread, but give us roses.  Another song was sung to the tune  of the   Battle Hymn of the Republic  and included the  lines,  We will tell them that 200 years of waiting is too long, we will have ERA.     We must show the legislators that women must  be written into the Constitution,  said Ann Mattar,  a marcher from New York City.    I don't care if  the woman is Asiatic, Black or disabled like myself,   she added as she waited for her delegation  to pass before wheeling her wheelchair forward  to join them.  As the procession passed beside the National  Archives building, each delegation paused.  They cheered and applauded the huge banner  stretched across the steps:  Equality of rights  under the law shall not be denied or abridged  by the United States or by any state on account  of sex.    Women dressed as suffragettes solemnly  after the largest feminine march in history. Many newspapers underestimated the huge crowd.   We assumed we would have the ERA without  any difficulty, but that was a mistake,   she  added.  and proudly displayed the Equal Rights Amendment banner.  It was at that site sixty-five years ago that  Alice Paul's march in support of women's suffrage ended in disruption.   The peaceful marchers were spit upon, slapped, kicked and burned  with cigar butts when a group of irrational onlookers aroused the crowd to attact the suffragists.   The city police turned their backs.  The 1978 marchers respectfully paused here  and then continued on, sometimes chanting  One,  two, three, four, we need three more (states to  ratify), five, six, seven, eight, Congress must  extend the date.     We shouldn't have to ask for a ratification.  Our rights should have been granted 200 years a-  go,   said ERA backer Susan Witheroe of Fayette -  ville, Pennsylvania.   I have no respect for a process that has denied  me my rights for 200 years,   said Susan Lock-wood  of Indianapolis.    She said the ERA is really a question of human rights and expressed regrets that it  must now be a political question.   Her four-year  old daughter, Ashley, seemed disappointed mat  so many children marched,   I thought I'd be the  only one  she said.   A number of families marched  together.  Nancy Sutton of Indianapolis said it was  thrilling  to see thousands of women from all over the U.S.   sharing her views.    It gives me support for my own  thinking,   she said. She brought along her nine-  year-old daughter Stephanie.  Over 325 organizations were represented in  what one policeman called  one of the best organized marches in Washington history.    Delegations included not only national contigents, but  also regional, state and local groups   They represented major political parties, feminist groups,  labor unions, professional organizations, civil  rights groups, educational organizations, civic  groups, and religious denominations.  One of the most geographically diverse delegations was the American Association of University  Women which had members from every state present.   National Negro Women and Pan Asian Pacific Women were also represented.   Student groups  from colleges and universities such as Vassar,  Princeton, and Wellesley took part.  The Gray Panthers, an activist organization for  older persons, sent a delegation.  A group of scientists, engineers and women  miners which included staff from the Bureau of  Mines marched.   Union participants included the  AFL-CIO, AFSCME, the American Federation of  Teachers, Communications Workers of America,  United Auto Workers, Hospital Workers Union,  and the International Ladies Garment Worker's  Union.   The National Federation of Business and  Professional Women and the National Council of  Churches also showed their support for the ERA.  Several distinguished speakers were on hand to  address the huge crowd gathered on the Capitol  lawn.   We must be prepared for a very long haul.  We will work this summer like we have never  worked before.   We will march into history, Mrs.  Schlafly.   Wherever you are, eat your heart out,   stated Rep. Barbara Mikulski of Michigan.   She  also said a  highly organized minority  has been   allowed to stop the will of the majority.     We need an extension of time to fight the lies  about the ERA,   said Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman.  (D-NY).    It is a fulfillment of the American  Dream and not a threat to anyone.   Time is on  our side and we will win.    Others who spoke at the rally included Patsy  Mink, President of Americans for Democratic  Action and former Congresswoman from Hawaii;  Midge Costanza, Assistant to President Carter,  who brought a  message of support from my boss.    Feminist author Betty Friedan, Ms .magazine  editor Gloria Steinem, actresses Jean Stapleton  and Mario Thomas, and Co-Chair of the National  Advisory Committee on Women, Bella Abzug  were other notables present who addressed the  multitude.  A fund raising event in the evening featured  appearances by celebrities and an auction  or ERA-related items.  On Monday, July 10th thousands of ERA  supporters lobbied Congress for the ERA Extension Resolution.   We must not leave Washington without  having a firm commitment, yes or no, from  every member of Congress,   Patsy Mink told  the marchers.   And if they dare to turn us down.. .we will  turn them out on the next election day.    As the ERA activities came to a close the  charter planes, buses, cars and trains started  their trips home.   They were loaded down  with ERA supporters who had personally delivered their message to Congress.  Some left wearing buttons that said  ERA  --The Battle's Not Over   and others left  singing,    We will have ERA    By NANCY SCOTT  Is equality in her future? (Photo by J. LaFourest)

On my 45th birthday, I brought a miracle  home from the hospital. My son Paul was only  four days old, but he and I and our family  and WOMANKIND had already been through a lot  together.  After a dry spell of 20 years, the shock  and joy of being pregnant began to soak in.  After the amniocentesis results were in, and  after things began to look like we were to be  blessed with a healthy son (ah, modern  technology,) we,my husband, my 21 year old  daughter, and I braced ourselves for the  changes this creature would make,and was already  making. During this time, WOMANKIND was forced  to find a new location, in a time span of 10  days, and then we had to move, and then clean  and fix the place up (and it was an awful  mess ) Emotionally and physically, I was  drained. Yet, the prospect of having my second  child solaced me and gave me hope. I felt  there was a reason for this baby. A purpose...  perhaps his mission in life would be to unite  two families, to give love to all those around  him, and to brighten the world a bit. He  certainly would grow up differently, given his  set of circumstances,...and he would stand a  good chance of being a true male feminist.  In a gift poem, Martha Eubanks calls him,   small Paul, Apostle to the 21st Century.  I  wonder. And worry. But, for now I am caught  up in the wonder of him and these past six  months.

Even with all the problems during my pregnancy, I felt like I was holding so much  love within my anatomy that nothing else could  go wrong and when I went to press with Issue  23 on Sept. 27, 1982, age 44 and almost six  months pregnant, I knew I had overcome all that  had been put before me in the way of pain  and prejudice and impediments. I was elated  and after leaving the printer, I hurried to  a maternity shop to purchase some much needed  clothes. Then it was back to the office at  3447 Washington Blvd. to make sure all the  machinery was off, clean up the paste-up mess,  and make a list of the things that must be  done while the paper was at press. It was a  long list and I'm just now beginning to check  off those tasks that were supposed to be done  that week.  But, to that night...  At this birth, my daughter and my husband  assisted me as loving coaches and WOMANKIND  photographer,  Katie Niles,  recorded the  event in black and white.    At home,  my daughter  and husband share the diapering and the rocking  with me,  but it is still difficult to find  time and energy and space for WOMANKIND.

Working since  I was 15, I had learned early to be cautious.  Now I was even more so. There was a maroon  and white car parked near the edge of the lot,  but it had been there all day. I exited and  quickly locked the door. Outside, as I walked  the 15 feet to my old green station wagon,  I enjoyed the early evening autumn air. It  soothed my flushed face. It had been a rough,  but wonderful day.  What a lovely springlike night,  I thought.  WOMANKIND was at  press, I was six months pregnant, all was  right with my world...   I slid into the car, locked the door,  and adjusted the seat to make room for my  stomach.  Too bad we don't have a tilt  wheel,  I was thinking as I pointed my key  towards the ignition. .  And then I heard running footsteps. A  black man was beside the car. His wild-eyed  face mouthed incoherent words as he furiously  tugged at the door handle. Something glimmered  in his other hand. I shouted at him:  Go  away  I'm not alone. There are people in the  house   He put something in his belt as he  bent over. I wanted to blow the horn; I wanted to get away,  i'm six months pregnant, I  thought, This can't be happening to me...if he  shoots me...the baby...will die.  I bent my  head towards the ignition. And then the night  exploded and warm blood cascaded over my face.  I knew immediately what he had done: he  had picked up one of the large black stones  that border the sidewalk and he had heaved it  at me. I was bleeding badly; I wanted to pass  out, yet, I was clear-headed. I realized what  might happen to me and my fetus if I lost  consciousness.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Ms Meg  by bulbul  Woman  for  V.P.  of  U.S.A.  A nationwide campaign for the nomination  of a woman Vice-Presidential candidate for  the 1984 Presidential election     for  both major parties     was launched in the  July issue of the LADIES' HOME JOURNAL.  Myrna Blyth, the magazine's Editor-in-  Chief, urged its more than 18 million  readers to fill out a simple form calling  for the nomination of a woman Vice-  Presidential candidate for both the  Democratic and Republican parties, and to  return the form to the magazine's New  York offices.  Blyth says the JOURNAL will pass the  petitions on to the chairpersons of the  Democratic and the Republican National  Committees.   We must make our leaders aware that  the could-a-woman-be-President debate is  outdated,  says Blyth.  if both political  parties were to nominate a woman for Vice-  President during the same election, the  woman-for-higher-office debate would  immediately evaporate. Moters would not  be voting for or against  a woman,   but  for the individual they feel is best  qualified, and for the policies that  individual believes in.   Editor's Note: Why Vice-President? Why  not a woman for President? WOMANKIND suggests  Eleanor Smeal, the past president of the  National Organization for Women.  STAFF  Wmv  m;ih    EDITOR  Judith LaFourest  STAFF  E.K.

Female  Farmers  on  the  Rise  According to recently released Census of  Agriculture results, one in 20 U.S. farms is  operated by a woman.  Judith Kalbacher of USDA's Economic Research Service recently analyzed the results  of the 1978 Census of Agriculture to determine the number of women farmers. This is  the first time these statistics have been  available, since this was the first census to  publish statistics on the gender of farm  operators.  They reveal that women are the sole or  principal operators of 128,000 of the  nation's farms, just over five percent. And  the numbers are rising. U.S. Department of  Labor figures show that the number of women  working principally as farmers or farm managers doubled between 1970 and 1980.  Kalbacher postulates that the number of  women farmers are probably, in actuality,  much greater than these figures indicate.  Since the census reporting forms allow just  one operator to be named per farm, it's  usually the man that's named by most farm  couples even though the woman may share  egually in the farm work and management responsibilities. When a woman is designated as the operator, it generally means  that she is the sole operator of the farm.  Considering this, there's a good chance  that a majority of the nation's farms have a  woman as one of the main operators.  from EARTH NATION  The Clearing   Nashville, IN.

Insurance Co. for Equality  Consumers United Insurance Company  (CUIC) endorses the National Organization  for Women's (N.O.W.) nationwide protest  against sex discrimination in insurance.   The question is not one of actuarial  data, but one of dignity. This is not a  debate over equations. It is one, rather, of  equality,  said Robert T. Freeman, Jr.  president of CUIC.  Freeman emphasized that the issue must  be resolved on moral philosophical, and ethical  grounds:  All American citizens  should be treated equally. We should  have one experience table showing the  over-all experience of all Americans and  not one for Blacks, not one for women,  not one for different ethnic groups or  any of the dozens of other ways Americans  can be sub-divided on arbitrary grounds.   CUIC supports premium rates based on  all-American experience tables for life,  accident, health, and other kinds of  insurance. The deviation from the  standard premium rates should be based  on sound underwriting practices that  include factors like life and health  styles, smoking and exercise habits,  weight, occupation, and other personal  choices that directly affect mortality  and morbidity tables.  CUIC, the largest worker-owned and  worker-managed firm in the country already  offers life and health insurance policies that  conform to the proposed non-discrimination  legislation now before Congress and is the  only insurance company in America that has  testified in favor of the legislation before  subcommittes of the U.S. Senate and  House of Representatives.
