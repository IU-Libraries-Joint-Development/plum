II  NO. 46  SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 16,1974  ;. * x-sr.1   8.00 PER YEAR  15 CENTS       10 PENCE  UNERAL  Unarmed Man Shot  By British Thugs  The Tricolour-draped coffin, with a black beret placed on top, bearing the remains of Gerard Coney  leaving the home of his parents.  and seeing a number of boys. He also  saw soldiers on a hillside nearby.  Some of the boys approached a van  and a shot rang out. The man who  was subsequently killed ran down the  road away from the soldiers for about  . 75 yards with his arms in the air.  Another shot rang out and the man  fell. The eyewitness did not see a gun  at any stage by those who attempting  to hijack the van.  Fennell's widow, Norah, who is  expecting another child in the New  Year, said:  We had been in England  but came home a year ago. The only  job Gerry could get was in Whiterock     industrial estate. But he had been off  sick this week.   Mrs. Fennell's mother, Mrs. Winnie  Pollock, said:  I got to the scene of  the shooting just as they were putting  Gerry in the ambulance. I went with  him. In the ambulance I opened his  Continued on Page 3  A young Belfastman, shot in the  hip by British troops at the scene of  an attempted hijacking in the  Twinbrook area, was fatally wounded  by another bullet in the back as he  ran with his hands raised to show he  was unarmed, relatives said.  He was identified as 27-year-old  Mr. Gerard Fennell, of Broom Park,  Twinbrook, married with a  seven-year-old daughter, Sharon.  The shooting happened about 200-  yards from his home-at the junction  of Stewartstown Road and  Summerhill Road and the shots came  from a nearby hillside manned by  soldiers. They claimed that Mr.  Fennell was 'an armed hijacker' and  was shot dead  when he turned his  gun on them.   According to the military, troops  had stopped another man removing  his gun after he was hit. But the  driver of the van involved in the  hijack attempt maintained, later, that  the man who spoke to him and told  him to drive his vehicle across the  road was not armed.  Another eye-witness also insisted  that, at no stage in the hijack, did he  see anyone with guns.  A British Army statement alleged  the man they shot was holding a gun  to the head of the van driver. He was  challenged twice and then he pointed  his gun at the soldiers.  The troops opened fire and the  man was seen to drop. He then got  up-still holding his gun-and went to  take cover behind the van,  the  military statement went on.  Father Eamonn Magee, of St.  Luke's, Twinbrook, said last night he  had spoken to the driver of the van  within minutes of the shooting. The  driver told him, specifically that the  man who spoke to him and asked him  to drive the vehicle across the road  was not armed. The driver had said:   I could swear he had no gun.   Father Magee said he had  questioned the driver carefully on the  point. There had been another man  present at the van, but the driver  could not say whether he was in  possession of a gun.  Another eye witness told of  looking out the window of his home  Hunger Strike Protest  By Republican Priso  mors  The thousands of mourners who  attended the funeral near Coalisland  this week of Long Kesh escapee,  Hugh Gerard Coney, heard that other  Republican prisoners in the  concentration camp had started a  hunger strike in protest against the  conditions under which they had to  live.  This was revealed at the graveside,  by Co. Tyrone Sinn Fein chairman,  Mr. Aidan Corrigan, when he read a  letter which he said had been  smuggled out of the jail, the previous  day, by a Co. Tyrone prisoner.   He asked me,  said Mr. Corrigan,   to   tell  you  of  the  insufferable,  inhuman conditions and indignities  which the men in Long Kesh have to  suffer. He said that one group had  already gone on hunger strike and  that others would follow suit.   Continued on Page 4  ON SATURDAY NOV. 16  A PROTEST PICKET WILL  BE HELD OUTSIDE THE  OFFICES OF BRITISH  AIRWAYS IN N.Y.  TO PROTEST INTERNMENT  OF IRISH MEN AND WOMEN  IN BRITISH JAILS  TIME: 2 TO 6 p.m.  Upwards of 8,000 people attended  the funeral of Hugh Gerard Coney,  the 24-year-old Annaghmore  (Coalisland) man who was shot dead  by British troops during Wednesday  morning's escape attempt by  Republican detainees from Long Kesh  Concentration Camp.  Coney, who was described in death  notices as a lieutenant in the East  Tyrone Command of the Provisional  I.R.A., was buried with full military  honours in St. Patrick's Cemetery,  Clonoe, a mile from his home.  The coffin, which was draped with  the Tricolour and a football jersey of  Clonoe G.F.C., of which he was a  member, was borne for a quarter-mile  from his home on the shoulders of  fellow team-mates and members of  the Republican movement.  A guard of honour of Fianna  Eireann and Clonoe G.F.C. marched  on both sides of the hearse to St.  Patrick's Church.  The remains were received by Rev.  Patrick Coyle, C.C., and Rev. Father  Joachim, O.F.M., one of the chaplains  at Long Kesh, and the priest who  administered the Last Rites to Mr.  Coney at the time of his death.  Speaking during Requiem Mass  Father Coyle said they were there to  extend their sympathy to James and  Kitty Coney, the parents of the dead  man, and to his brothers and sisters.  He added:  We in this parish have  over the past few years prayed at  Mass for peace and justice for all of  Ireland. In the days ahead, we will  continue to do so, and we will  remember the deceased in our  prayers.   Following the Requiem Mass, Mr.  Coney was interred in the adjoining  cemetery, where, following the  sounding of the Last Post, men in  para-military uniforms fired a volley  of shots over the grave.  In a graveside oration Seamus  Loughran of Belfast, an ex-internee,  said he prayed that the body of  Gerard Coney would be the last one  to be brought from the  hell-hole  of  Long Kesh. He added:  We have a  duty to do all in our power to bring  about the closure of Long Kesh and  an end to internment .  Mr. Loughran, Sinn Fein organiser  in Belfast, said that, next to love of  God came love of one's country, and  nowhere more so than in Ireland had  this proved true.  It's truly a noble  thing to die for one's country,  he  said.  It's one thing to give one's life  in the heat of battle. It's an entirely  different thing to dedicate your life in  pursuit of what you believe in, an  ideal that you know can, and  Con tinued on Page 3  Provos Hi-jack  British Army Mail  The Provisional IRA in Belfast on  Monday claimed that they were  studying a haul of British Army  documents seized jn a mail van  hold-up near the military  headquarters in the North last week.  Included in the haul, said the IRA,  were letters to girl friends, wives and  relatives from soldiers detailing army  life    the general theme of which was  that complete demoralisation of the  British soldier in Ireland.   The IRA said that the mail bags  also contained   10,000 in cash,  together with money order payments  to informers, details of commercial  suppliers to the Army, confidential  military documents, details of  undercover cars and by plain clothes  patrols, lists of deserters and absentees,  and the names and addresses of UDR  personnel. In a statement the IRA  said:  The Belfast Brigade intend to  act immediately on the considerable  amount of information obtained.   The R.U.C. confirmed that five  armed men had hi-jacked a Post  Office van near Bridge Street car park  in Lisburn at 6:30 p.m. last Friday.  A police spokesman said that the  van and its crew were driven to a side  road four miles away near  Hillsborough. There the raiders took  several mail bags from the van and  left the crew with the vehicle. The  exact number of mail bags taken was  not disclosed. The Army made no  comment on the incident.  Along with their statement on the  raid, the I.R.A. released photostat  copies of military documents, some  of which were stamped  restricted.   The statement said:  On Friday,  November 1, 1974, in a well  co-ordinated and selective operation,  an intelligence unit of the Belfast  Brigade captured mail belonging to  the British Army.   Then the IRA listed 11 items,  beginning with letters from soldiers,  details of commercial suppliers to the  Army and lists of deserters and  absentees.  One item was money orders (Giros)   made payable to individuals from all  areas of the Six Counties.  The IRA  said:  From this we now have a clear  picture of who is supplying the  British Army with information.   Other items mentioned were:  confidential military documents  regarding a conference relating to the  building of Long Kesh; confidential  military documents to all police  stations; a list containing names and  addresses of UDR personnel; a list of  male and female applicants for the  UDR and other security forces  together with details of  referees,   and letters from people in the 26  Counties stating that they wished to  join the British Army.  The IRA said that the details of  undercover cars included tax books  and details of car number plates.  The Army admitted that some mail  from soldiers was probably in the  bags seized by the I.R.A., but it  denied that any confidential  documents were in the sacks. A  spokesman, said:  Anything of a  sensitive nature would go through the  British Forces Post or via a special  courier.

        <pagetext>CM  LU  LU  North's Jail Riots  Cost   2 Million  Mmm   iM Mm  Damage estimated at nearly   2  million was caused in the Northern  Ireland Concentration Camp and Jail  riots two weeks ago, the Secretary of  State Merlyn Rees told the British  House of Commons on October 30th.  He said  the damage done at Long  Kesh would cost one and a half  million pounds, while that at  Magilligan Camp amounted to over  two hundred thousand pounds.  He  did not give any estimate for the  repairs of Crumlin Road or Armagh  Prison.  Mr. Rees appeared to hint at new  measures for the separation of  detainees and convicted prisoners,  saying that he hoped to make a  statement shortly. He was  unforthcoming on the question of  building a new permanent prison in  Northern Ireland, a project which  would take several years. It is known  that after Direct Rule was first  imposed in 1972, it was proposed to  build a new prison at Magilligan but  this was rejected on a number of  grounds, including the proximity to  the Republic.  Mr. Rees said that more than a  thousand internees and detainees  took part in the Long Kesh riot and  that  in the circumstances it was  remarkable that there were so few  casualties .  ARROGANT CLAIM BY  REES REFUTED  Many men who were injured in the  riots are still incarcerated in  Long  Kesh and have not been hospitalised  them it proved ineffective because of  the wind direction. They claim  that  the helicopters were then ordered to  fly low and spread the gas among the  internees by the action of the  helicopter rotor blades. This  particular type of gas had not so far  been used anywhere else in the world  and in the U.S. tests carried out with  the gas on rabbits showed that high  concentration can cause permanent  damage to the eyes. It replaces the  old CS gas and caused much greater  discomfort and irritation of the skin,  eyes, nose and throat.  INTERNEES BOYCOTTSECRET  COMMISSION HEARINGS  As part of a continuing strategy to  make the system of detention  without trial unworkable, the 450  Republican detainees at Long Kesh  Concentration Camp have decided to  boycott the secret commission  hearings held inside the Camp to  review detainees' cases.  The boycott becomes effective  immediately, according to Mrs. Maire  Drumm, Vice-President of Provisional  Sinn Fein, in Belfast on October  30th. The secret courts would not be  used again because they had been  proved  to be a farce'   The decision of the Republican  detainees to boycott the commission  hearings, which recommenced this  week after a two-week break  following the camp burning, means  that commissioners will have to  decide whether or not to review cases  in the absence of detainees.

BRhlSH ARMY USED  CRGASIN LONG KESH  There is no doubt that the British  Army, used the new and more lethal  CR gas for the first time in Northern  Ireland in Long Kesh on October  15th. This new item in the Army riot  control stock was approved by the  Defence Ministry almost a year ago,  but until two weeks ago, it was  authorised for use only at Long Kesh.  Prisoners, who are used to the effects  of CS gas, claim that a new, more  irritating and paralysing agent was  used on them.  Internees also claim that when the  first batch of CR gas was used on  Knights Of  Equity  Convention In  Buffalo  Dennis O'Reilly of Rochester, New  York, was elected Supreme Sir Knight  of the Knights of Equity at the 79th  annual convention held at Buffalo,  New York. O'Reilly recently retired  as Deputy Fire Chief after serving 33  years with the Rochester Fire  Department. Cork born he came to  this Country in 1929 married and  remained in Rochester since. He is the  father of seven children.  John Bolsinger of Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, was elected Supreme  Vice Sir Knight. Other elected were:  Kenneth Power, secretary; Martin  Schail, treasurer; Norman Fox,  lecturer; Trustees are, John Marren,  Daniel Clifford, Raymond McKelvy,  Alfred Pedro, Michael Walsh, James  Parks, and Bernard McClinchey.  Reverend Thomas R. Bartley was  reappointed Supreme Chaplain.  Marion K. McMahon was elected  national president of the Daughters of  Erin the auxiliary to the Knights of  Equity.

An internee was shot dead by  British troops during rioting at Long  Kesh camp following a break-out by  Republican detainees early Tuesday.  A Catholic chaplain who was in the  camp said CS. gas was being used on  the prisoners. He said he had seen at  least 12 men spreadeagled against a  compound wire and being beaten by  troops. All of them were covered in  blood, he said.  Government sources said that 20  Republican detainees had escaped  from the camp shortly after midnight.  Eighteen of them were re-captured  and a full-scale search was going on  for the other two. A spokesman said a  tunnel had been discovered in the  camp during a search after the escape.  Meanwhile conditions at the camp  were described as shocking by an  all-party delegation of Assemblymen  who visited it.  Members of the delegation, who  inspected the camp on the invitation  of the North's Secretary of State, Mr.  Merlyn Rees, expressed fears that the  camp might be burned down again if  it were rebuilt.  Rev. Ian Paisley, D.U.P. leader,  who led the loyalist group, said the  conditions were really  sub-human   and the S.D.L.P. delegation,  consisting of Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon,  Chief Whip, and Messrs. Desmond  Gillespie, and Michael Canavan, said  that the conditions were 100 times  worse than they had imagined.  Mr. Gillespie said last night there  OGLAIGH NkhEIRE/VNN  seems to be no other solution but to  end internment and get rid of this  place.  These men have reached such  a state of desperation that we were  told that even if the camp is rebuilt, it  would very likely be burned down  again , he said.  Mr. Gillespie said:  We saw a meal  being delivered to the loyalist  compound in tin containers. It  consisted of beef-burgers or sausage  rools swimming in gravy and nothing  else. The men refused to eat it and  were existing on their food parcels.    I got a list of complaints from  Gusty Spence, the loyalist leader,  which said Governor Truesdale should  be sacked and protested that the men  had neither light, heat nor hot water.  The S.D.L.P. delegation said that  because of orders most of the  republican prisoners refused to meet  them but they had chatted to some of  them and learned of conditions which  were really  indescribable.   Rev. Ian Paisley said that in the  loyalist compound the conditions  were  sub-human  he said. There was  neither light nor heat and at night  men were using candles. One toilet  was so flooded that waders would be  needed to use it. In one hut with 80  men, some were sleeping on soaking  mattresses while others were lying on  springs stretched across the hut.  The Loyalist prisoners, he said,  were refusing the food as a protest  and were living on bread and tea and  a quarter pound of margarine per day.  r  i   UNITED   BROOKLYN   IRISH  BAYRIDGE-FLATBUSH  IRISH   NORTHERN  AID   UNITS  CHRISTMAS BENEFIT DANCE  (or the  Oppressed People of N.E.

Bishops  Again  Betray Their  People   WE NEEDTHEM   Last week saw two bishops again  calling for support for the British  forces in Ireland. Both bishops spoke  on the same day (October 22) and  both condemned what they called  terrorism.  The Catholic Bishop of Down and  Connor (which includes Belfast), Dr.  William Philbin, is a noted  Conservative and upholder of the  church-state alliance. On October  22nd, he gave yet another speech in  favour of British power, when he  urged Catholics to help the British  Army and the Royal Ulster  Constabulary. He said that everybody  must show their revulsion towards the  dominance of the organised terrorist.   Certain groups in Northern  Ireland  Dr. Philbin said,  Have by  now, ensured that our generation will  be marked in history by the stigma of  organised savagery. We shall be  known for developments that have  been destructive and evil-the  introduction into society of new  kinds of atrocities and of inhuman  ruthlessness in their execution. As  one phase of barbarity abates,  another unfailingly takes its place   the Bishop went on.  The bishop was not referring here  to the savagery of the R.U.C. Special  Branch and S.A.S. murder squads. He  continued, in fact, to plead for  support for these:  Only the agencies  of security are in a position to  establish the peace and order we all  need and desire, and to avert the  growing degeneracy of our society. If  we need them, as we do, daily and  nightly, we have also a duty to help  them .  Dr. Philbin made no attempt to  conceal his hatred for revolutionaries,  and his love for tyrants. Who in God's  name needs torturers and murderers   daily and nightly    The bishop continued with his  references to Satan, whom he believes  to be behind the principles of  freedom and the rights of man.   Enough of evil has emanated from  among our numbers-just now, our  most urgent need is to counter the  widespread corruption of our children  by agents of Satan . Perhaps the most  suitable answer to this pervertion of  principle and religion was given by a  Republican paper published in the  impoverished and crucified ghettoes  of Belfast:  The peoples' conscience  are clear-who clothed the naked,  sheltered the homeless and gave  succour to the oppressed?   ANGRY REACTION  IN BELFAST  In a front page article Belfast's   Andersonstown News  accused the  bishop of urging people  to turn  informer . It also accused Dr. Philbin  of  remaining silent on the fate of the  Long Kesh internees .  The paper says there has been   angry reaction   n the  Andersonstown area over the bishop's  statement, and claims that local  community leaders are concerned  that the church is giving approval to   the operation of plain clothes squads  of S.A.S. and R.U.C. men . The  paper also said that after the  intervention of Catholic clergy,  barricades were taken down in the  Lower Falls in 1969 and four people  were later killed in a battle with  security forces after police and troops  raided houses.  BUCHANAN LASHES OUT  On the same day as Dr. Philbin  spoke the Protestant Archbishop of  Dublin, Dr. Alan Buchanan, himself a  former British soldier, made a similar  speech. Dr. Buchanan said that it  must be recognised  that most  bloodshed in the country was caused  by irishmen . He also called on  people in the South to  do more in  supporting the security forces on  both sides of the border . He also  stated he believed that  we, as a  people, could do far more to support  Con tinued on Page 18

        <pagetext>(esh Loyalists Threaten  Hunger Stele To De;  The trouble-torn Long Kesh  Concentration Cam was simmering  on the verge of yet another crisis as  more than 230 Loyalist prisoners  vowed to go on a mass hunger strike   to the death  at midnight to protest  at the  sub-human conditions  in the  Loyalist compounds.  The men, who are all UVF and Red  Hand prisoners, have taken their  action as part of an escalating UVF  plan that follows the massive protest  in the North when the Loyalist  caused widespread disruption with  more than 70 hoax bomb scares in  'hijacked vehicles.  Another 200 Loyalist prisoners in  Long Kesh, who belong to the UDA,  are to decide whether or not they will  join the hunger strike. A spokesman  for the UVF prisoners in Belfast said  that they have been refusing food  from prison authorities for two weeks  and have been surviving on food  parcels brought in from outside.  Many of them are ill because of the  conditions, which have been  aggravated since the Republicans  burned down 80  of the camp last  month.  The only difference between  Long Kesh and a Nazi concentration  camp is that mass graves are not being  Funeral Attended  Continued from Page 1  pro bably  will, cost you your life.   The dice was loaded against the  Republican movement, Mr. Loughran  added, in terms of British Army  strength and  Britain's misuse of the  law and involvement in torture,  degredation and murder. Yet this  choice of martyrdom has been  accepted in every generation of our  race, and great and noble souls have  flung themselves into conflict, only to  be crushed under the heels of the  invader. Yet, again and again, rose the  dominant need to be Irish and to be  seen to be Irish and to fight for all  that is truly Christian in the way of  justice.   Mr. Loughran went on:  Love of  Ireland could be said to be a love of  death, but her children have never  failed to answer the call to arms.  They have never ceased to love her.   Hugh Coney's name was now joined  with those of Pearse and Barry, he  said.  Demanding the ending of  internment, Mr. Loughran said:  Our  people must not be left to fight alone.  There are many thousands of  Ireland's sons and daughters abroad.  They must also get into the fight. It's  a fight for national emancipation.  Realise your mighty strength.  Together, we can accomplish what we  please. Use it now for there is only  one ending-success and the triumph  of right and justice over iniquity and  wrong.   The dead man's parents, James and  Christmas Dance.  For Irish Relief  Under a banner of  United  Brooklyn Irish  the Bayridge and  Flatbush units of Irish Northern Aid  are scheduling a joint affair to raise  fundsforthe common goal   The thoughts of the Irish people  suffering through another Christmas  of deprivation are spurning their  efforts to raise funds to be turned  over in time to aid the families of  prisoners in North East Ireland prior  to Christmas.  The joint Committee is comprised  of: Evelyn and Bill Gallagher, Patrick  Biesty, Pat Riordan and James Smith  of Bayridge Unit. Kate and John  Toolan, Mary Cunningham, Ann  Cusick, Mary and Pat McNicholl, Pat  Mullin and Inge and Sean Toner of  the Flatbush Unit.  The affair will be 'held at  Cummings Bros. American Legion  Post, 4516, Ave. D. Brooklyn on  November 30th, 1974 from 9 p.m. to  1 a.m. Two bottles per table of ten  plus set ups. The donation is  7.50.  For table reservations call J.

According to Mr. Smyth, 80  of  the Loyalist prisoners were suffering  from 'flu, or a severe cold. Because of  the deterioration in the conditions of  the men, due to the failure of the  prison authorities and the  Government to act, the prisoners had  decided on the hunger strike as the  only way to decent conditions. The  strike would continue  to the death,   or until the authorities took action.  It was later, reported that the  Loyalist prisoners are to be moved to  rebuilt accomodation in the  compound.  The UVF, meanwhile, has decided  not to contest next year's election for  the Northern Ireland Convention,  while its recently formed political  wing, the Volunteer Party, has  dropped plans for a direct challenge  for parliamentary influence.  Instead, the UVF intends to  restrict its political activity to that of  a ginger group. Members will be  encouraged to join other right-wing  Unionist parties as long as this does  not interfere with their duties as  members of the UVF.   Kitty Coney, and his girl friend Eilish  McSloy followed the coffin along  with his brothers, Jim and Frank, and  sisters Collette and Noelle, from the  family home, a short distance outside  Coalisland, to St. Patrick's Church,  Clonoe.  Wreaths from relatives and many  Republican organisations were laid on  the grave.  During the funeral a British army  helicopter flew overhead, and roads  leading to Coalisland were manned by  R.U.C. and British troops.  Coalisland came to a standstill and  black flags were hung at windows and  street corners. Businesses closed down  in many Republican areas as a mark  of respect and sympathy  demonstrations attracted large crowds  in Belfast, Derry and Newry.  Vehicles were hijacked and set on  fire in the Dungannon area. As a  result of one hijacking, an hotel  function planned for pensioners in  Ballygawley estate had to be  cancelled.  British Thugs  Continued from Page 1  shirt and I could see he had been shot  in the back right through the heart.    I was told, earlier, that soldiers  were lying behind trees on high  ground overlooking the new road at  Wandleside factory. They were just  waiting for an innocent victim to  walk out of Twinbrook estate.   I was told by a person who saw  the shooting that Gerry had just  asked the driver to put the van across  the road when there was a shot. Gerry  fell, shot through the hip and, as he  went down, he raised his hands to  show that he had n,o weapon.  - Then, there was another shot-the  one in the back that killed him. They  say it was a 'black' soldier who shot  Gerry.  'OFFICER'CLAIM  A man who claimed to be speaking  on behalf of the 1st Battalion, Belfast  Brigade, Provisional I.R.A. said  Fennell was an officer in their G  Company.  The spokesman said he was  murdered in cold blood.   We have been expecting reprisals  against our volunteers after our  successful operations over the past  few days,  he added.  ii fgi ira  On Friday evening November 1st  1974 a capacity crowd was on hand  at Gaelic Park Casino to pay tribute  to Mario Biaggi. Congressman Biaggi a  strong vocal supporter of Ireland's  right to freedom and self rule arrived  at 11 p.m. with his gracious wife  Marie and their lovely daughter. A  standing ovation was accorded the  Guest of Honor as he entered the  Casino with his family. Congressman  Biaggi, who has been long deserving  of this  Irish Night  due to his  constant speaking out in Congress on  behalf of our war torn homeland,  mingled and introduced his family to  the packed house.  On opening the evenings  ceremonies, Inwood Irish Northern  Aid Chairman, Mike Meehan  presented a plaque to Margaret  Clancy Muldoon, a recently married  colleen from County Leitrim, for the  dedication and outstanding services to  the cause of Irish Freedom over the  past three years. Guest Speaker Sister  St. Hugh, editor of The Irish People  Newspaper was then introduced to  the receptive gathering. Sister spoke  on Biaggi's loyalty to Ireland and to    the Irish community in this country.   It would be an insult to Mr.  Biaggi , said Sister St. Hugh,  if we  even attempted to list the times and  the occasions when Congressman  Biaggi took a stand on behalf of the  people of Ireland.  According to  Sister St. Hugh,  no page is large  enough to contain the number of  occasions of dedicated service Mr.  Biaggi has rendered to Ireland and to  the Irish and Irish American people in  the United States.  In concluding Sister St. Hugh  presented Congressman Biaggi with a  plaque on behalf of The Irish People.  Biaggi again received a standing  ovation.  In presenting the plaque Sister St.  Hugh said she had one sorrow and  that was that she was not presenting  it to him as the mayor of New York  City.  We know one thing for sure, if  Mr. Biaggi was the mayor of New  York City we wouldn't have British  double decker buses coming into the  city next July .  Overwhelmed with the applause  and the introduction Mr. Biaggi  stepped forward holding the plaque  and with pride glistening in his eyes  he thanked the people who placed so  much trust and hope in him.  ht A Huge Success  en  CD  CO  Sr. St. Hugh makes a presentation to Congressman Biaggi.   Somehow or other,  Mr. Biaggi  said,  when the picture of Ireland was  being painted somewhere along the  line the brush of justice never  touched that little island and ever  since it has been the victim of British  oppression .  Calling on the Irish people to unite  Mr. Biaggi pointed out that politicians  must be made to believe that the Irish  issue will be politically profitable to  them otherwise he said,  your  representatives will not take a stand  for your cause .  He pointed out that there are only  six Greek Congressmen in Congress  yet they were able to hold up  Congress until aid was given to the  600,000 Greeks in Cyprus.  What ,  he asked are your fifty-two  Irish-American Congressmen doing  for you?  The final speaker of the evening  was Father Vallaley who had just  arrived from County Tyrone. The  good Father related many stories on  the atrocities that have become an  everyday occurrence in Ireland's six  occupied counties, and pleaded for  total support of Irish Northern Aid as  this organization would ultimately be  responsible for driving the British  Government and Troops out of  Ireland.  Prior to singing the National  Anthems Bob McCann asked for  support of the Baltimore Four, now  laying in U.S. Federal Prisons because  they chose to help our Freedom  Fighters in Ireland.  This Inwood Irish Northern Aid  sponsored Tribute under the  chairmanship of Tyrone's Sean  McGonnell and his committee of Pat    Brian Clarke, Danny McElroy,  Kevin Duffy, Vera Baker, Brendan  Heagney, Jim Touhy, Mike   Marion  Loftus and Carmel Costelloe did an  excellent job in catering to the large  crowd. As the evening came to an end  Mike Meehan presented a check for   3,500.00 to the U.S. Representative,  Irish Northern Aid Matt Higgins to be  used in buying warm clothing for the  Irish men and women now interned in  various concentration camp.s  throughout Ireland.

        <pagetext>Twenty-Five Cents   12.00 per year  people  U.S.P.S. 070-77t    3  rt   ma of  mm mmueaiusM  M AMSMCA  Volume XI  Number 12  March 27, 1982      ILIIMiEl  ENDS VISIT  The whirlwind American tour won by newly elected Free State head Charles  Haughey along with the election from Garret FitzGerald concluded last week  amidst mixed reviews.  New York  The tour began in New York  with a visit to the Economic  Club, comprising prestigious corporate executives and businessmen. Here Haughey's appeal  was for American investment  into the Free State economy.  Haughey asserted that the economy was on sound basis and  nearing the end of recession.  However, as Haughey spoke,  the Punt or Irish Free State  pound, fell under the o;  and fifty cent mark. Haughey  was questioned about the north  and here in a statement which  dramatically contrasted with his  public utterances during his prior  term in office, asserted that  the  principal obstacle in the north  was the British guarantee to  Loyalists... We will have no progress until that is removed.   Haughey also announced that  he believed that the Free State  would soon become an exporter  of oil After the address, Haughey  visited St. Agnes Church on  43rd St., the site of the apartment building where Haughey's  predecessor, Eamon de Valera,  was baptized.  Washington  The newly re-elected Free  State head then journeyed to  Washington, DC. He attended  a White House luncheon with  several Congressmen, Secretary  Charles   Haughey  of State Alexander Haig, and  celebrities, including Maureen  O'Hara. Haughey was called  upon to make an exchange of  toasts. Instead, he spoke at length,  stating:  There is much to be  done. And the first thing is that  Britain be encouraged to seek  more positively and more actively a change in attitude and outlook which would pave the way  for unity and so enable her final  withdrawal from Ireland to take  place with honor and dignity.   Reagan  President Reagan later asserted  that the United States would  not become involved in influencing Vritish policy in Ireland.  This reaction was praised both  by Margaret Thatcher and Ian  Paisley's deputy Peter Robinson. Haughey's position varied  dramatically from his rhetoric  during his first administration,  wherein his visits to America  were marked by attacks upon  Irish-American opposition to  British rule. The remarks generated for Haughey widespread  publicity in Ireland, where Haughey holds a tenuous majority that  may bring a new election within  the year and in which Haughey  is expected to campaign by assuming a mantle of Irish nationalism  while maintaining collaboration  with the British.  A member of the Ulster Defense Association  convicted for the assassination in Larne in 1980 of  Irish Independence Party co-founder, Protestant  John Turnly, claimed in a Belfast court at the  conclusion ofthe trial that he had been working for  the British Army's SAS squad.  Twenty-seven year old Ro-   they were all members of the  bert McConnell named uio two  SAS soldiers whom he claimed  supplied him with information  and with weapons for the killing  and who had discussions with  him on Miriam Daly, Bernadette McAliskey and John Turnly, all of whom were shot by the  UDA in 1980 and 1981 in  attacks claimed under the cover-  name, the Ulster Freedom Fighters. In his statement McConnell  said that  in or around the month  of April 1980,1 was working as  a fish salesman in the Larne  area. I was stopped one day  near Cushendall by a van containing a number of men. I became satisfied subsequently that  SAS and I had dealings with  them on that and a number of  subsequent occasions through  their leaders who were Sergeant  Tom Aiken and Corporal Mc-  Gow.   He said that at their behest he  placed a listening device in a  bar in Cushendall, County Antrim, in which Sinn Fein vice-  president Gerry Adams was allegedly attending a meeting. He  continued:  During a series of  subsequent meetings with them  (the SAS) they discussed with  me Republican leaders and in  particular Turnly, Miriam Daly  and Bernadette McAliskey...  Continued on pg. 13  The two hundred and twentieth St Patrick's Day  Parade in New York, despite a chilling rain, attracted  more than one hundred and ninety bands and tens of  thousands of marchers. A dramatic escalation of  Irish patriotism in this year's parade was a highlight  of the day, led by an Irish Northern Aid contingent  nearly one thousand strong. This contingent included  Sean Sands, whose deceased brother Bobby Sands,  MP,  was  unanimously  named  Honorary Grand  Marshal by the Parade Committee.  (See story page 10)

        <pagetext>2    GAP*61  FITZGERALD'S EIGHT MONTHS AS FREE STATE PREMIER  IS  cu  honesty mate  lyinepti  BY KEVIN BURKE  GARRET FitzGerald's eight-  month term of office as Free  State premier, which ended in  Leinster House on Tuesday,  March 9th, was the shortest  premiership in the history ofthe  state. It ended with his credibility  in tatters and his ineptitude  exposed.  In the dying hours of his government,  on Monday night, the Fine Gael leader  U-turned for the last time, uselessly  abandoning the supposed sacrosanct  strictures of his vicious budget     on  VAT, subsidies and taxation of social  welfare     in a final vain attempt to buy  the necessary independent votes and win  the all-important prize of power.  And capital projects at Whitegateoil refinery,  Arigna mines and Dublin's port and docks site  were blithely promised at a cost which put the  unmentionable Knock airport in the shade.  If his political acumen before the January  budget had matched his lust for power after it,  the general election need not have taken place  and he could still be in office today.  HUNGER-STRIKE  It was on June 30th last year that Garret  FitzGerald's coalition government took over  from that of Charles Haughey, who had, to all  intents and purposes, lost the general election  because of his inaction on the H Block hunger-  strike.  FitzGerald, in the first heady hours of office  pinpointed the hunger-strike as his most urgent  priority. Four hunger-strikers were already dead  at that time; six more were to die.  In the next days he held a meeting with the  British ambassador, significantly veiled in  secrecy. And his first meeting with the hunger-  strikers' relatives on July 3rd, was lengthy, but  already concentrating on persuading them to  undermine the protest.  But following the death of Joe McDonnell  on July 8th, FitzGerald, raising the hunger-  strike for the first time in Leinster House, placed  the onus for tho deaths on the British government. He dispatched two of his senior ministers  to London, and later called on United States  president Ronald Reagan and the EEC to  intervene.  That was the high-point of his hunger-strike  effort. Discovering that actions were needed to  back up his words, he began to back off and by  tho end of July was publicly attempting to  wash his hands of tho crisis. His statements  from then on laid the blame on the IRA leaden  ship not the British government.  In the middle of August, relatives of the  hunger-strikers were forcibly removed from  government buildings.  ECONOMY  Meanwhile, Garret FitzGerald was well into  breaking his first set of economic electoral  promises. From the beginning of his government's term the cry went up that things were  much worse economically than he had imagined  and in fact the state was on the verqe of bank  ruptcy.  His first budget in mid-July, with a plethora  of punitive measures, signalled that the electoral  goodies wore not going to be delivered. Two  days after getting it through Leinster House he  sought to silence criticism within his own party,  and his coalition allies, the Labour Party, by  declaring a long summer holiday for the parliament to the end of October.  But throughout the summer the voices of  protest, among his own supporters and the vital  independents, grew louder, spurred on, as  August drew to a close, by a speech from his  right-wing  Minister  for  Industry John Kelly,      Garret FitzGerald's meeting with Margaret  Thatcher in London in November last year brought  more evidence of his political ineptitude and of his  readinoss to collaborate  likening social welfare recipients to 'cannibal  piglets'.  Almost continuous price increases fuelled  the grumblings and in September when FitzGerald went to chop the Tuam sugar factory as  part of his 'lame ducks' policy, the outcry  forced him to retract. In November, forty  thousand angry farmers marched on Dublin in  piotest at their worsening economic conditions.  FitzGerald turned his attention then to  wage costs and, as the centralised pay-deal talks  headed for collapse, launched a verbal attack  on workers' living standards which was enthusiastically taken up by employers' organisations.  But here again, there was disappointment  with his big talk when, as the year closed, he  agreed a public sector pay increase of 15 ,  which although well below inflation rates, was  most displeasing to pnvate sector employers.  CRUSADE  Under pressure politically because of his  inability to take any effective economic action,  FitzGerald, in September, hit, partly by accident, on a handy diversion.  With monumental hypocrisy, and with much  pious reference to Tone and Davis, he launched  what became known as his 'constitutional  crusade'. Supposed to be a total reform of the  Free State constitution of 1937, it was primarily  aimed, not at lemoving social injustice in the  South, but  at wooing loyalists in the North.  His concentration on the removal of Articles  2 and 3 from the constitution, which claim  territorial jurisdiction over thirty-two counties,  and Ins description of the Free State as sectarian, won him praise ftom Doth the former  Vanguard leader, now Official Unionist, William  Craig, and from the murderous Ulster Defence  Association.  With the hunger-strike over in October, FitzGerald felt the way cleai for more extended  collaboration with Britain. A meeting with  Northern   direct-ruler   James  Prior  in  Dublin  preceded   a   summit  in   London with  British  premier Margaret Thatcher on November 6th.  LONDON  Before FitzGerald went to London he was  nicely set up by Charles Haughey, who claimed  that out of the Anglo-Irish study groups, which  he had himself instigated with Thatcher, would  come great things including a three-tier Anglo-  Irish Council which should be announced at the  forthcoming meeting.  FitzGerald returned from London with an  Anglo-Irish Council which was merely a name  stuck on the existing system of meetings  between government leaders and civil servants.  He did not have the third tier, much-vaunted by  Haughey, of a council of parliamentary members  from London and Dublin. In London, FitzGerald  had been craven. Humiliated by Britain's  contempt for its weak hunger-strike protests,  and trumpeting abroad that his state was  bankrupt, he cut a sorry figure. To win his way  back into Britain's good books he promised  further collaboration in the future by way of  joint courts to include Northern judges to try  political offences in the South and by allowing  RUC men to interrogate suspects in Free State  garda stations.  Meanwhile, both sides agreed to give the  Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act a further  try as an alternative to extradition, and by the  end of his term in office FitzGerald had six of  the Crumlin Road escapees imprisoned by the  Dublin Special Court and the first Irishman in  the same dock for political offences alleged to  have taken place in England.  Also, on the home front, legislation was  being prepared to extend already repressive  legislation, to end the right to bail, the right  to silence in custody and further extend garda  powers.  CENSORSHIP  But Garret FitzGerald will not just be  remembered for his ardent collaboration with  Britain nor for the viciousness of his economic  measures in breach of his election promises.  There were plenty of other memorable points  which left his personal imprint on the office  of Free State premier.  Although a supposed liberal, he has nothing  to show from his term to support this image.  On the question of political censorship he  displayed his attitude by the appointment of  the hard-line Patrick Cooney as Minister for  Posts and Telegraphs.  In August, he drew widespread criticism at  home, and derision abroad, by banning the  newly elected Westminster MP for Fermanagh  and South Tyrone, Owen Carron, from RTE.  And in the January election FitzGerald's  determination to silence his republican critics,  inspired an extension on the ban on Sinn Fein,  which backfired when the enabling legislation  was ruled unconstitutional by a High Court  judge.  JOBBERY  Among the few grateful admirers who FitzGerald will have won for his period as premier  are the British agents, the Littlejohn brothers,  and the loyalist bomber Norman Parkinson of  the UDA, all of whom were freed early from  Mountjoy prison.  There are also several beneficiaries of his  corrupt patronage in the form of highly-  paid jobs in the government and civil service.  During his short spell, an array of political  appointments of this kind include several of his  political cronies and their relatives, including  his own son and daughter-in-law. Even in the  dying days of his government the hypocrite  who had previously denounced political  jobbery made partisan appointments in the  garda, the judiciary and to state bodies.  Garret FitzGerald goes down as yet another  Irish leader who has failed and betrayed his  people.  Eight months of Garret FitzGerald were  more than enough.  Dublin's  Clemency for  UDA Prisoner  The surprise release from  Mountjoy Prison of UDA man  Frederick Parkinson has produced some criticism alleging  that the same humanitarian concern is not extended to Republican prisoners on either side of  the Border.  Parkinson (37), the father of  two children, was serving a 12-  year sentence for an attempted  firebomb blitz in Dublin. He  was convicted of having incendiary devices and firearms in  1977. He would have been due  for release in 1986 with full  remission.  But, following intervention on  his behalf by various people and  organizations, he has been given  a full remission on humanitarian  grounds     on condition that he  does not come back into the  Free State.  For much of his period in  Mountjoy, Parkinson shared accommodations in the prison's  basement with the Littlejohn  brothers who were released last  year, also on humanitarian  grounds, with half their sentences  still to serve.  Among the organizations which  worked for Parkinson's release  was the Catholic lay organization, the Knights of St. Colum-  banus. Among the individuals  who helped were Bishop Com-  iskey, one of Dublin's auxiliary Catholic bishops, and a  Unionist former mayor of Belfast,  John Carson.  Carson became friendly with  the then Lord Mayor of Dublin,  Fine Gael TD Fergus O'Brien,  and last year they went on a  joint tour of the United States.  Carson admits that O'Brien   opened up negotiations  for  him with the result that he met  Dr. Garret FitzGerald and the  then Minister for Justice, Jim  Mitchell.  James Eccles, until recently  Supreme Knight in Ireland of  the Knights of St. Columbanus,  says that, together with Denis  Maloney, also a Knight, and the  solicitor who defended Parkinson, he visited him in prison on  a number of occasions. Afterwards, they made representation  to the Minister for Justice.  At a press conference at UDA  headquarters in Belfast, Parkinson praised the humanitarian  policies of Fine Gael.  They  were the people who released  me, and I am very grateful,  he  said.  He added that he now regrets  having gone into the Free State  with the intention of doing damage. He had been treated well  in prison and those Catholics  and Protestants who had intervened to bring about his release  contrasted starkly with  certain  Loyalist politicians  whom he  didn't name.  He said that he would be remaining a member of the UDA.
