II  NO. 46  SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 16,1974  ;. * x-sr.1   8.00 PER YEAR  15 CENTS       10 PENCE  UNERAL  Unarmed Man Shot  By British Thugs  The Tricolour-draped coffin, with a black beret placed on top, bearing the remains of Gerard Coney  leaving the home of his parents.  and seeing a number of boys. He also  saw soldiers on a hillside nearby.  Some of the boys approached a van  and a shot rang out. The man who  was subsequently killed ran down the  road away from the soldiers for about  . 75 yards with his arms in the air.  Another shot rang out and the man  fell. The eyewitness did not see a gun  at any stage by those who attempting  to hijack the van.  Fennell's widow, Norah, who is  expecting another child in the New  Year, said:  We had been in England  but came home a year ago. The only  job Gerry could get was in Whiterock     industrial estate. But he had been off  sick this week.   Mrs. Fennell's mother, Mrs. Winnie  Pollock, said:  I got to the scene of  the shooting just as they were putting  Gerry in the ambulance. I went with  him. In the ambulance I opened his  Continued on Page 3  A young Belfastman, shot in the  hip by British troops at the scene of  an attempted hijacking in the  Twinbrook area, was fatally wounded  by another bullet in the back as he  ran with his hands raised to show he  was unarmed, relatives said.  He was identified as 27-year-old  Mr. Gerard Fennell, of Broom Park,  Twinbrook, married with a  seven-year-old daughter, Sharon.  The shooting happened about 200-  yards from his home-at the junction  of Stewartstown Road and  Summerhill Road and the shots came  from a nearby hillside manned by  soldiers. They claimed that Mr.  Fennell was 'an armed hijacker' and  was shot dead  when he turned his  gun on them.   According to the military, troops  had stopped another man removing  his gun after he was hit. But the  driver of the van involved in the  hijack attempt maintained, later, that  the man who spoke to him and told  him to drive his vehicle across the  road was not armed.  Another eye-witness also insisted  that, at no stage in the hijack, did he  see anyone with guns.  A British Army statement alleged  the man they shot was holding a gun  to the head of the van driver. He was  challenged twice and then he pointed  his gun at the soldiers.  The troops opened fire and the  man was seen to drop. He then got  up-still holding his gun-and went to  take cover behind the van,  the  military statement went on.  Father Eamonn Magee, of St.  Luke's, Twinbrook, said last night he  had spoken to the driver of the van  within minutes of the shooting. The  driver told him, specifically that the  man who spoke to him and asked him  to drive the vehicle across the road  was not armed. The driver had said:   I could swear he had no gun.   Father Magee said he had  questioned the driver carefully on the  point. There had been another man  present at the van, but the driver  could not say whether he was in  possession of a gun.  Another eye witness told of  looking out the window of his home  Hunger Strike Protest  By Republican Priso  mors  The thousands of mourners who  attended the funeral near Coalisland  this week of Long Kesh escapee,  Hugh Gerard Coney, heard that other  Republican prisoners in the  concentration camp had started a  hunger strike in protest against the  conditions under which they had to  live.  This was revealed at the graveside,  by Co. Tyrone Sinn Fein chairman,  Mr. Aidan Corrigan, when he read a  letter which he said had been  smuggled out of the jail, the previous  day, by a Co. Tyrone prisoner.   He asked me,  said Mr. Corrigan,   to   tell  you  of  the  insufferable,  inhuman conditions and indignities  which the men in Long Kesh have to  suffer. He said that one group had  already gone on hunger strike and  that others would follow suit.   Continued on Page 4  ON SATURDAY NOV. 16  A PROTEST PICKET WILL  BE HELD OUTSIDE THE  OFFICES OF BRITISH  AIRWAYS IN N.Y.  TO PROTEST INTERNMENT  OF IRISH MEN AND WOMEN  IN BRITISH JAILS  TIME: 2 TO 6 p.m.  Upwards of 8,000 people attended  the funeral of Hugh Gerard Coney,  the 24-year-old Annaghmore  (Coalisland) man who was shot dead  by British troops during Wednesday  morning's escape attempt by  Republican detainees from Long Kesh  Concentration Camp.  Coney, who was described in death  notices as a lieutenant in the East  Tyrone Command of the Provisional  I.R.A., was buried with full military  honours in St. Patrick's Cemetery,  Clonoe, a mile from his home.  The coffin, which was draped with  the Tricolour and a football jersey of  Clonoe G.F.C., of which he was a  member, was borne for a quarter-mile  from his home on the shoulders of  fellow team-mates and members of  the Republican movement.  A guard of honour of Fianna  Eireann and Clonoe G.F.C. marched  on both sides of the hearse to St.  Patrick's Church.  The remains were received by Rev.  Patrick Coyle, C.C., and Rev. Father  Joachim, O.F.M., one of the chaplains  at Long Kesh, and the priest who  administered the Last Rites to Mr.  Coney at the time of his death.  Speaking during Requiem Mass  Father Coyle said they were there to  extend their sympathy to James and  Kitty Coney, the parents of the dead  man, and to his brothers and sisters.  He added:  We in this parish have  over the past few years prayed at  Mass for peace and justice for all of  Ireland. In the days ahead, we will  continue to do so, and we will  remember the deceased in our  prayers.   Following the Requiem Mass, Mr.  Coney was interred in the adjoining  cemetery, where, following the  sounding of the Last Post, men in  para-military uniforms fired a volley  of shots over the grave.  In a graveside oration Seamus  Loughran of Belfast, an ex-internee,  said he prayed that the body of  Gerard Coney would be the last one  to be brought from the  hell-hole  of  Long Kesh. He added:  We have a  duty to do all in our power to bring  about the closure of Long Kesh and  an end to internment .  Mr. Loughran, Sinn Fein organiser  in Belfast, said that, next to love of  God came love of one's country, and  nowhere more so than in Ireland had  this proved true.  It's truly a noble  thing to die for one's country,  he  said.  It's one thing to give one's life  in the heat of battle. It's an entirely  different thing to dedicate your life in  pursuit of what you believe in, an  ideal that you know can, and  Con tinued on Page 3  Provos Hi-jack  British Army Mail  The Provisional IRA in Belfast on  Monday claimed that they were  studying a haul of British Army  documents seized jn a mail van  hold-up near the military  headquarters in the North last week.  Included in the haul, said the IRA,  were letters to girl friends, wives and  relatives from soldiers detailing army  life    the general theme of which was  that complete demoralisation of the  British soldier in Ireland.   The IRA said that the mail bags  also contained   10,000 in cash,  together with money order payments  to informers, details of commercial  suppliers to the Army, confidential  military documents, details of  undercover cars and by plain clothes  patrols, lists of deserters and absentees,  and the names and addresses of UDR  personnel. In a statement the IRA  said:  The Belfast Brigade intend to  act immediately on the considerable  amount of information obtained.   The R.U.C. confirmed that five  armed men had hi-jacked a Post  Office van near Bridge Street car park  in Lisburn at 6:30 p.m. last Friday.  A police spokesman said that the  van and its crew were driven to a side  road four miles away near  Hillsborough. There the raiders took  several mail bags from the van and  left the crew with the vehicle. The  exact number of mail bags taken was  not disclosed. The Army made no  comment on the incident.  Along with their statement on the  raid, the I.R.A. released photostat  copies of military documents, some  of which were stamped  restricted.   The statement said:  On Friday,  November 1, 1974, in a well  co-ordinated and selective operation,  an intelligence unit of the Belfast  Brigade captured mail belonging to  the British Army.   Then the IRA listed 11 items,  beginning with letters from soldiers,  details of commercial suppliers to the  Army and lists of deserters and  absentees.  One item was money orders (Giros)   made payable to individuals from all  areas of the Six Counties.  The IRA  said:  From this we now have a clear  picture of who is supplying the  British Army with information.   Other items mentioned were:  confidential military documents  regarding a conference relating to the  building of Long Kesh; confidential  military documents to all police  stations; a list containing names and  addresses of UDR personnel; a list of  male and female applicants for the  UDR and other security forces  together with details of  referees,   and letters from people in the 26  Counties stating that they wished to  join the British Army.  The IRA said that the details of  undercover cars included tax books  and details of car number plates.  The Army admitted that some mail  from soldiers was probably in the  bags seized by the I.R.A., but it  denied that any confidential  documents were in the sacks. A  spokesman, said:  Anything of a  sensitive nature would go through the  British Forces Post or via a special  courier.

        <pagetext>CM  LU  LU  North's Jail Riots  Cost   2 Million  Mmm   iM Mm  Damage estimated at nearly   2  million was caused in the Northern  Ireland Concentration Camp and Jail  riots two weeks ago, the Secretary of  State Merlyn Rees told the British  House of Commons on October 30th.  He said  the damage done at Long  Kesh would cost one and a half  million pounds, while that at  Magilligan Camp amounted to over  two hundred thousand pounds.  He  did not give any estimate for the  repairs of Crumlin Road or Armagh  Prison.  Mr. Rees appeared to hint at new  measures for the separation of  detainees and convicted prisoners,  saying that he hoped to make a  statement shortly. He was  unforthcoming on the question of  building a new permanent prison in  Northern Ireland, a project which  would take several years. It is known  that after Direct Rule was first  imposed in 1972, it was proposed to  build a new prison at Magilligan but  this was rejected on a number of  grounds, including the proximity to  the Republic.  Mr. Rees said that more than a  thousand internees and detainees  took part in the Long Kesh riot and  that  in the circumstances it was  remarkable that there were so few  casualties .  ARROGANT CLAIM BY  REES REFUTED  Many men who were injured in the  riots are still incarcerated in  Long  Kesh and have not been hospitalised  them it proved ineffective because of  the wind direction. They claim  that  the helicopters were then ordered to  fly low and spread the gas among the  internees by the action of the  helicopter rotor blades. This  particular type of gas had not so far  been used anywhere else in the world  and in the U.S. tests carried out with  the gas on rabbits showed that high  concentration can cause permanent  damage to the eyes. It replaces the  old CS gas and caused much greater  discomfort and irritation of the skin,  eyes, nose and throat.  INTERNEES BOYCOTTSECRET  COMMISSION HEARINGS  As part of a continuing strategy to  make the system of detention  without trial unworkable, the 450  Republican detainees at Long Kesh  Concentration Camp have decided to  boycott the secret commission  hearings held inside the Camp to  review detainees' cases.  The boycott becomes effective  immediately, according to Mrs. Maire  Drumm, Vice-President of Provisional  Sinn Fein, in Belfast on October  30th. The secret courts would not be  used again because they had been  proved  to be a farce'   The decision of the Republican  detainees to boycott the commission  hearings, which recommenced this  week after a two-week break  following the camp burning, means  that commissioners will have to  decide whether or not to review cases  in the absence of detainees.

BRhlSH ARMY USED  CRGASIN LONG KESH  There is no doubt that the British  Army, used the new and more lethal  CR gas for the first time in Northern  Ireland in Long Kesh on October  15th. This new item in the Army riot  control stock was approved by the  Defence Ministry almost a year ago,  but until two weeks ago, it was  authorised for use only at Long Kesh.  Prisoners, who are used to the effects  of CS gas, claim that a new, more  irritating and paralysing agent was  used on them.  Internees also claim that when the  first batch of CR gas was used on  Knights Of  Equity  Convention In  Buffalo  Dennis O'Reilly of Rochester, New  York, was elected Supreme Sir Knight  of the Knights of Equity at the 79th  annual convention held at Buffalo,  New York. O'Reilly recently retired  as Deputy Fire Chief after serving 33  years with the Rochester Fire  Department. Cork born he came to  this Country in 1929 married and  remained in Rochester since. He is the  father of seven children.  John Bolsinger of Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, was elected Supreme  Vice Sir Knight. Other elected were:  Kenneth Power, secretary; Martin  Schail, treasurer; Norman Fox,  lecturer; Trustees are, John Marren,  Daniel Clifford, Raymond McKelvy,  Alfred Pedro, Michael Walsh, James  Parks, and Bernard McClinchey.  Reverend Thomas R. Bartley was  reappointed Supreme Chaplain.  Marion K. McMahon was elected  national president of the Daughters of  Erin the auxiliary to the Knights of  Equity.

An internee was shot dead by  British troops during rioting at Long  Kesh camp following a break-out by  Republican detainees early Tuesday.  A Catholic chaplain who was in the  camp said CS. gas was being used on  the prisoners. He said he had seen at  least 12 men spreadeagled against a  compound wire and being beaten by  troops. All of them were covered in  blood, he said.  Government sources said that 20  Republican detainees had escaped  from the camp shortly after midnight.  Eighteen of them were re-captured  and a full-scale search was going on  for the other two. A spokesman said a  tunnel had been discovered in the  camp during a search after the escape.  Meanwhile conditions at the camp  were described as shocking by an  all-party delegation of Assemblymen  who visited it.  Members of the delegation, who  inspected the camp on the invitation  of the North's Secretary of State, Mr.  Merlyn Rees, expressed fears that the  camp might be burned down again if  it were rebuilt.  Rev. Ian Paisley, D.U.P. leader,  who led the loyalist group, said the  conditions were really  sub-human   and the S.D.L.P. delegation,  consisting of Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon,  Chief Whip, and Messrs. Desmond  Gillespie, and Michael Canavan, said  that the conditions were 100 times  worse than they had imagined.  Mr. Gillespie said last night there  OGLAIGH NkhEIRE/VNN  seems to be no other solution but to  end internment and get rid of this  place.  These men have reached such  a state of desperation that we were  told that even if the camp is rebuilt, it  would very likely be burned down  again , he said.  Mr. Gillespie said:  We saw a meal  being delivered to the loyalist  compound in tin containers. It  consisted of beef-burgers or sausage  rools swimming in gravy and nothing  else. The men refused to eat it and  were existing on their food parcels.    I got a list of complaints from  Gusty Spence, the loyalist leader,  which said Governor Truesdale should  be sacked and protested that the men  had neither light, heat nor hot water.  The S.D.L.P. delegation said that  because of orders most of the  republican prisoners refused to meet  them but they had chatted to some of  them and learned of conditions which  were really  indescribable.   Rev. Ian Paisley said that in the  loyalist compound the conditions  were  sub-human  he said. There was  neither light nor heat and at night  men were using candles. One toilet  was so flooded that waders would be  needed to use it. In one hut with 80  men, some were sleeping on soaking  mattresses while others were lying on  springs stretched across the hut.  The Loyalist prisoners, he said,  were refusing the food as a protest  and were living on bread and tea and  a quarter pound of margarine per day.  r  i   UNITED   BROOKLYN   IRISH  BAYRIDGE-FLATBUSH  IRISH   NORTHERN  AID   UNITS  CHRISTMAS BENEFIT DANCE  (or the  Oppressed People of N.E.

Bishops  Again  Betray Their  People   WE NEEDTHEM   Last week saw two bishops again  calling for support for the British  forces in Ireland. Both bishops spoke  on the same day (October 22) and  both condemned what they called  terrorism.  The Catholic Bishop of Down and  Connor (which includes Belfast), Dr.  William Philbin, is a noted  Conservative and upholder of the  church-state alliance. On October  22nd, he gave yet another speech in  favour of British power, when he  urged Catholics to help the British  Army and the Royal Ulster  Constabulary. He said that everybody  must show their revulsion towards the  dominance of the organised terrorist.   Certain groups in Northern  Ireland  Dr. Philbin said,  Have by  now, ensured that our generation will  be marked in history by the stigma of  organised savagery. We shall be  known for developments that have  been destructive and evil-the  introduction into society of new  kinds of atrocities and of inhuman  ruthlessness in their execution. As  one phase of barbarity abates,  another unfailingly takes its place   the Bishop went on.  The bishop was not referring here  to the savagery of the R.U.C. Special  Branch and S.A.S. murder squads. He  continued, in fact, to plead for  support for these:  Only the agencies  of security are in a position to  establish the peace and order we all  need and desire, and to avert the  growing degeneracy of our society. If  we need them, as we do, daily and  nightly, we have also a duty to help  them .  Dr. Philbin made no attempt to  conceal his hatred for revolutionaries,  and his love for tyrants. Who in God's  name needs torturers and murderers   daily and nightly    The bishop continued with his  references to Satan, whom he believes  to be behind the principles of  freedom and the rights of man.   Enough of evil has emanated from  among our numbers-just now, our  most urgent need is to counter the  widespread corruption of our children  by agents of Satan . Perhaps the most  suitable answer to this pervertion of  principle and religion was given by a  Republican paper published in the  impoverished and crucified ghettoes  of Belfast:  The peoples' conscience  are clear-who clothed the naked,  sheltered the homeless and gave  succour to the oppressed?   ANGRY REACTION  IN BELFAST  In a front page article Belfast's   Andersonstown News  accused the  bishop of urging people  to turn  informer . It also accused Dr. Philbin  of  remaining silent on the fate of the  Long Kesh internees .  The paper says there has been   angry reaction   n the  Andersonstown area over the bishop's  statement, and claims that local  community leaders are concerned  that the church is giving approval to   the operation of plain clothes squads  of S.A.S. and R.U.C. men . The  paper also said that after the  intervention of Catholic clergy,  barricades were taken down in the  Lower Falls in 1969 and four people  were later killed in a battle with  security forces after police and troops  raided houses.  BUCHANAN LASHES OUT  On the same day as Dr. Philbin  spoke the Protestant Archbishop of  Dublin, Dr. Alan Buchanan, himself a  former British soldier, made a similar  speech. Dr. Buchanan said that it  must be recognised  that most  bloodshed in the country was caused  by irishmen . He also called on  people in the South to  do more in  supporting the security forces on  both sides of the border . He also  stated he believed that  we, as a  people, could do far more to support  Con tinued on Page 18

        <pagetext>(esh Loyalists Threaten  Hunger Stele To De;  The trouble-torn Long Kesh  Concentration Cam was simmering  on the verge of yet another crisis as  more than 230 Loyalist prisoners  vowed to go on a mass hunger strike   to the death  at midnight to protest  at the  sub-human conditions  in the  Loyalist compounds.  The men, who are all UVF and Red  Hand prisoners, have taken their  action as part of an escalating UVF  plan that follows the massive protest  in the North when the Loyalist  caused widespread disruption with  more than 70 hoax bomb scares in  'hijacked vehicles.  Another 200 Loyalist prisoners in  Long Kesh, who belong to the UDA,  are to decide whether or not they will  join the hunger strike. A spokesman  for the UVF prisoners in Belfast said  that they have been refusing food  from prison authorities for two weeks  and have been surviving on food  parcels brought in from outside.  Many of them are ill because of the  conditions, which have been  aggravated since the Republicans  burned down 80  of the camp last  month.  The only difference between  Long Kesh and a Nazi concentration  camp is that mass graves are not being  Funeral Attended  Continued from Page 1  pro bably  will, cost you your life.   The dice was loaded against the  Republican movement, Mr. Loughran  added, in terms of British Army  strength and  Britain's misuse of the  law and involvement in torture,  degredation and murder. Yet this  choice of martyrdom has been  accepted in every generation of our  race, and great and noble souls have  flung themselves into conflict, only to  be crushed under the heels of the  invader. Yet, again and again, rose the  dominant need to be Irish and to be  seen to be Irish and to fight for all  that is truly Christian in the way of  justice.   Mr. Loughran went on:  Love of  Ireland could be said to be a love of  death, but her children have never  failed to answer the call to arms.  They have never ceased to love her.   Hugh Coney's name was now joined  with those of Pearse and Barry, he  said.  Demanding the ending of  internment, Mr. Loughran said:  Our  people must not be left to fight alone.  There are many thousands of  Ireland's sons and daughters abroad.  They must also get into the fight. It's  a fight for national emancipation.  Realise your mighty strength.  Together, we can accomplish what we  please. Use it now for there is only  one ending-success and the triumph  of right and justice over iniquity and  wrong.   The dead man's parents, James and  Christmas Dance.  For Irish Relief  Under a banner of  United  Brooklyn Irish  the Bayridge and  Flatbush units of Irish Northern Aid  are scheduling a joint affair to raise  fundsforthe common goal   The thoughts of the Irish people  suffering through another Christmas  of deprivation are spurning their  efforts to raise funds to be turned  over in time to aid the families of  prisoners in North East Ireland prior  to Christmas.  The joint Committee is comprised  of: Evelyn and Bill Gallagher, Patrick  Biesty, Pat Riordan and James Smith  of Bayridge Unit. Kate and John  Toolan, Mary Cunningham, Ann  Cusick, Mary and Pat McNicholl, Pat  Mullin and Inge and Sean Toner of  the Flatbush Unit.  The affair will be 'held at  Cummings Bros. American Legion  Post, 4516, Ave. D. Brooklyn on  November 30th, 1974 from 9 p.m. to  1 a.m. Two bottles per table of ten  plus set ups. The donation is  7.50.  For table reservations call J. Toolan  212-IN-2-6550 or A. Cusick  451-0819, M. McNicholl 469-9874.  dug outside the wire,  Loyalist  Assemblyman Mr. Hugh Smyth said  at the weekend.  According to Mr. Smyth, 80  of  the Loyalist prisoners were suffering  from 'flu, or a severe cold. Because of  the deterioration in the conditions of  the men, due to the failure of the  prison authorities and the  Government to act, the prisoners had  decided on the hunger strike as the  only way to decent conditions. The  strike would continue  to the death,   or until the authorities took action.  It was later, reported that the  Loyalist prisoners are to be moved to  rebuilt accomodation in the  compound.  The UVF, meanwhile, has decided  not to contest next year's election for  the Northern Ireland Convention,  while its recently formed political  wing, the Volunteer Party, has  dropped plans for a direct challenge  for parliamentary influence.  Instead, the UVF intends to  restrict its political activity to that of  a ginger group. Members will be  encouraged to join other right-wing  Unionist parties as long as this does  not interfere with their duties as  members of the UVF.   Kitty Coney, and his girl friend Eilish  McSloy followed the coffin along  with his brothers, Jim and Frank, and  sisters Collette and Noelle, from the  family home, a short distance outside  Coalisland, to St. Patrick's Church,  Clonoe.  Wreaths from relatives and many  Republican organisations were laid on  the grave.  During the funeral a British army  helicopter flew overhead, and roads  leading to Coalisland were manned by  R.U.C. and British troops.  Coalisland came to a standstill and  black flags were hung at windows and  street corners. Businesses closed down  in many Republican areas as a mark  of respect and sympathy  demonstrations attracted large crowds  in Belfast, Derry and Newry.  Vehicles were hijacked and set on  fire in the Dungannon area. As a  result of one hijacking, an hotel  function planned for pensioners in  Ballygawley estate had to be  cancelled.  British Thugs  Continued from Page 1  shirt and I could see he had been shot  in the back right through the heart.    I was told, earlier, that soldiers  were lying behind trees on high  ground overlooking the new road at  Wandleside factory. They were just  waiting for an innocent victim to  walk out of Twinbrook estate.   I was told by a person who saw  the shooting that Gerry had just  asked the driver to put the van across  the road when there was a shot. Gerry  fell, shot through the hip and, as he  went down, he raised his hands to  show that he had n,o weapon.  - Then, there was another shot-the  one in the back that killed him. They  say it was a 'black' soldier who shot  Gerry.  'OFFICER'CLAIM  A man who claimed to be speaking  on behalf of the 1st Battalion, Belfast  Brigade, Provisional I.R.A. said  Fennell was an officer in their G  Company.  The spokesman said he was  murdered in cold blood.   We have been expecting reprisals  against our volunteers after our  successful operations over the past  few days,  he added.  ii fgi ira  On Friday evening November 1st  1974 a capacity crowd was on hand  at Gaelic Park Casino to pay tribute  to Mario Biaggi. Congressman Biaggi a  strong vocal supporter of Ireland's  right to freedom and self rule arrived  at 11 p.m. with his gracious wife  Marie and their lovely daughter. A  standing ovation was accorded the  Guest of Honor as he entered the  Casino with his family. Congressman  Biaggi, who has been long deserving  of this  Irish Night  due to his  constant speaking out in Congress on  behalf of our war torn homeland,  mingled and introduced his family to  the packed house.  On opening the evenings  ceremonies, Inwood Irish Northern  Aid Chairman, Mike Meehan  presented a plaque to Margaret  Clancy Muldoon, a recently married  colleen from County Leitrim, for the  dedication and outstanding services to  the cause of Irish Freedom over the  past three years. Guest Speaker Sister  St. Hugh, editor of The Irish People  Newspaper was then introduced to  the receptive gathering. Sister spoke  on Biaggi's loyalty to Ireland and to    the Irish community in this country.   It would be an insult to Mr.  Biaggi , said Sister St. Hugh,  if we  even attempted to list the times and  the occasions when Congressman  Biaggi took a stand on behalf of the  people of Ireland.  According to  Sister St. Hugh,  no page is large  enough to contain the number of  occasions of dedicated service Mr.  Biaggi has rendered to Ireland and to  the Irish and Irish American people in  the United States.  In concluding Sister St. Hugh  presented Congressman Biaggi with a  plaque on behalf of The Irish People.  Biaggi again received a standing  ovation.  In presenting the plaque Sister St.  Hugh said she had one sorrow and  that was that she was not presenting  it to him as the mayor of New York  City.  We know one thing for sure, if  Mr. Biaggi was the mayor of New  York City we wouldn't have British  double decker buses coming into the  city next July .  Overwhelmed with the applause  and the introduction Mr. Biaggi  stepped forward holding the plaque  and with pride glistening in his eyes  he thanked the people who placed so  much trust and hope in him.  ht A Huge Success  en  CD  CO  Sr. St. Hugh makes a presentation to Congressman Biaggi.   Somehow or other,  Mr. Biaggi  said,  when the picture of Ireland was  being painted somewhere along the  line the brush of justice never  touched that little island and ever  since it has been the victim of British  oppression .  Calling on the Irish people to unite  Mr. Biaggi pointed out that politicians  must be made to believe that the Irish  issue will be politically profitable to  them otherwise he said,  your  representatives will not take a stand  for your cause .  He pointed out that there are only  six Greek Congressmen in Congress  yet they were able to hold up  Congress until aid was given to the  600,000 Greeks in Cyprus.  What ,  he asked are your fifty-two  Irish-American Congressmen doing  for you?  The final speaker of the evening  was Father Vallaley who had just  arrived from County Tyrone. The  good Father related many stories on  the atrocities that have become an  everyday occurrence in Ireland's six  occupied counties, and pleaded for  total support of Irish Northern Aid as  this organization would ultimately be  responsible for driving the British  Government and Troops out of  Ireland.  Prior to singing the National  Anthems Bob McCann asked for  support of the Baltimore Four, now  laying in U.S. Federal Prisons because  they chose to help our Freedom  Fighters in Ireland.  This Inwood Irish Northern Aid  sponsored Tribute under the  chairmanship of Tyrone's Sean  McGonnell and his committee of Pat    Brian Clarke, Danny McElroy,  Kevin Duffy, Vera Baker, Brendan  Heagney, Jim Touhy, Mike   Marion  Loftus and Carmel Costelloe did an  excellent job in catering to the large  crowd. As the evening came to an end  Mike Meehan presented a check for   3,500.00 to the U.S. Representative,  Irish Northern Aid Matt Higgins to be  used in buying warm clothing for the  Irish men and women now interned in  various concentration camp.s  throughout Ireland.

        <pagetext>en,      LU  -J  Q.  o  LU  CL  X  Cbtioria  9;  CO  E   gt;  o  H  FAUL  IS  FOUL  When we think of the many men who, in the full vigor  and glory of their manhood, laid down their lives without  a murmur of complaint or regret, we must ask ourselves  this' question   for what did they die? And if we are honest  we must answer in their own words, spoken with their  dying breath   they died for the full and complete and  untrammelled freedom of all Ireland. They did not die for  a prosperous Dominion or an ersatz Republic. They died  endeavouring in the words of Tone 'to break the  connection with England, the never failing source of all  our ills. They died endeavoring to make the Sovereign  Republic of all Ireland, in the inspired words of Padraic  Pearse,  not free but Gaelic as well, not Gaelic merely, but  free as well.  We are not honoring them, not following in  their footsteps, we are not striving to complete their work  unless we are working with all our strength to make  Ireland Irish and free.  Father Denis Faul who was speaking last week on  The  media and the troubles in the North  said that he did not  think the I.R.A. should be allowed on the national radio  and television to persuade people to their point of view. It  is obvious that Father Faul would have a free Ireland for a  chosen few but not for those who are willing to suffer and  die for their freedom.  Father Faul like other men would like to be involved  but don't ask him to take a risk. He has to be on the   right  side and who is Father Faul to decide Government  policy? Like his forefathers when they issued their Joint  Pastoral in the 20's that the 'Free State' and its Provisional  Government were the true legitimate and only civil  authorities in Ireland. The Bishops at the time called the  Republicans plunderers, raiders, looters, wasters, rebels  and pursuers of other unladylike avocations.  What startles some of us is not that he calls our men  'murderous gangs' but that he has the gaul to accept   5,000 from the A.O.H. to aid the families of these same  internees he claims have no right to freedom of speech. In  the future we would hope that organizations in this  country who indeed want to help the Republican  Movement would find some other way of distributing their  funds to the families of the internees and exclude a man  who from all appearances is using the sufferings of the  broken hearted internees and their families to swell his  personal library.  By truth and honor, by principle and sacrifice alone will  Ireland be free. If anyone has a right to free speech it is the  men and women of the Republican movement who have  fought for freedom. Who would challenge the fact that  Hugh Coney had a right to speak on R.T.E. and to expose  the horrible conditions he endured at Long Kesh     yet  because he was a member of The Irish Republican Army  according to Father Faul this disqualified him from  freedom of speech. Think of it   U11II1111111111111     I     111111111     111     111     1111     1111S IB i 11P f 1111111U11111111 11111111111     11111111 LI  1 IRISH NORTHERN AID DANCE (  WOODLAWN UNIT,  1 SATURDAY, NOV. 16th        at St. Barnabas Elem.

You will honour Gerard Coney's  memory best by ensuring the release  of his comrades and the achievement  of the ideals for which he suffered  imprisonment, rjpression,  inhumanity, and for which *ie was  finally murdered by the British  soldiers,  he went on.   I ask you to band together as  never before so that this will be the  last coffin to come out of Long  Kesh.  Mr. Corrigan said that some  people had advocated massive prison  escapes.  Only the men behind the  wire have the right to make such a  dangerous decision.   We, however, have an obligation  to back their decision to the hilt,   Mr. Corrigan said.  I think no man  should ask someone else to do what  he is not prepared to do himself. The  obligation is not on the internees but  on the people outside. We have an  obligation to destroy Long Kesh. We  owe that to Gerard Coney and his  many comrades who have made the  supreme sacrifice for Ireland.   Twenty-four-year-old Mr. Coney  was one of the 32 Long Kesh  internees who escaped from the  prison by crawling through a 195ft.  tunnel. He was shot soon after getting  out of the prison.  The three Republican detainees  who escaped from Long Kesh were  recaptured that night -- after just 20  hours of freedom. And, in what they  called a direct reprisal for the fatal  shooting of Hugh Coney during the  breakout, the Provisional IRA shot  dead two British soldiers in the centre  of Crossmaglen, Co. Armagh.  Elsewhere in the North there were  angry protests and demonstrations  over the shooting. Widespread rioting  took place in Dungannon, and major  protest marches in Derry and Belfast  brought traffic to a standstill.  The three escapees were picked up  by an RUC patrol on the edge of the  Andersonstown shortly after 10 p.m.  An RUC spokesman said a police  mobile patrol spotted the three at the  Milltown Road, in the Upper Falls.  One of the men tried to run off, but  was apprehended after a short chase.  The three are Edward Maguire  (26), Gerard Rice (22), and James  Walsh (19), all from the Belfast area.  The RUC spokesman said the three  were wearing the same clothes in  which they made their escape.  It is unlikely that the three will be  returned immediately to Long Kesh.  It seems more likely they will be held  for questioning and may possibly be  charged with escaping from lawful  custody.  The two soldiers who dies in  Crossmaglen were from the Duke of  Edinburgh's regiment. They were on  foot patrol in the centre of the village  when they were hit by the two bursts  of machine gun fire.  Three of the soldiers fell and the  others dived for cover. Two died a  short time later, but the third soldier  is not believed to have veen seriously  injured.  The shooting came just after  lunchtime and eye-witnesses said they  saw about six men in combat jackets  take up positions near the town  centre just before the ambush. They  were carrying 'ight sub-machine guns  and were waiti ig for the foot patrol.  After the initial bursts of fire,  those soldiers who had gained cover,  returned fire and a 15-minute  gunbattle ensued. A Saracen  armoured car was brought in to  remove the soldiers who had been hit  and they were airlifted to hospital.  The Provisional IRA later claimed  responsibility for the attack and in  their statement warned that further  attacks would be mounted in the area  in retaliation for  the cold-blooded  murder of the Long Kesh internee.   In Belfast the city was the scene of  several protest marches and  hijackings, particularly in the Falls  and Springfield Road areas. Buildings  in Ann Street were damaged by a  150-lb bomb in a lorry which had  been hijacked in Macouley Street in  the Market area of the city about 2  o'clock. The Lorry was enroute to the  RUC station at Musgrave Street but  was stopped at a check point by  police.  In the Springfield Road area earlier  in the day three buses were hi-jacked  but were later recovered. A meeting  of building workers took place at the  City Hall and almost 100 of the staff  at Belfast's main post office walked  out in protest over the shooting of  Mr. Cooney.  Hundreds of Queen's University  students blocked traffic at Belfast  City Hall yesterday when they sat  down and held a protest meeting in  Bedford Street. A protest march from  Belvoir Park to Andersonstown was  organised by the Irish Republican  Publicity Centre in Belfast.  Almost 300 dockers staged a  30-minute protest strike in Derry and  traffic in the city centre came to a  standstill when the Quayish were  blocked by a bus.  Earlier 150 workers from factories  on the Springtown industrial estate  walked a mile to the Fort George  army camp and stoood in silence for  two minutes outside the main gates.  Earlier 12 shots were fired at the  Rosemount RUC. station and shots  were also fired at checkpoints on  Letterkenny    Road    and    the  Continued on Page 17  SHAmnOCK  imponrs  3150 No. Laramie  Chicago, III. 60641  Open 6 days a week,  closed Monday  If you want something Irish  90 to Shamrock Imports   or call (312) 725-9622  Mid-Manhattan Unit I.N.A.

        <pagetext>Letters to the Editor       Taking Sides' With Britain  Two Bishops, Dr. Philibin and Dr.  Buchanan have recently asked the  people of Ireland to co-operate with  what they have euphemistically  termed the  Security Forces  in  occupied Ireland.  Like appeals were made in Norway  and France during World War II.  From time to time certain Free  State politicians, notably Doctors  Conor Cruise O'Brien and FitzGerald  also request co-operation with the  same so-called  security forces  in  the North from their rather safe  havens in Howth and Ballsbridge. A  look at the composition of this   security force  so dear to certain  people in high places may not be  amiss.  Basically what are cosily called the   Security Forces  consist of the  following:: The R.U.C. and their  Special Branch, mainly drawn from  ex-B Specials; the U.D.R., a sectarian  civilian force, para-military by nature,  many of its members doubling with  extreme Loyalist militants such as the  U.V.F., the U.F.F., the  Red Hand ,  the Tartan gangs, etc., the Crown  Force of Her Majesty's Army, the  more notoriously bigoted and anti  Irish regiments being posted to the  North, along with S.A.S., M.R.F.,  M.I.5., M.I., 6, and  others -all  sinister and underhand agents of the  British Army, also  black-press   Army propagandists (Bishop Tickle  too allowed himself to be used) and  their side-kicks in Fleet Street and the  B.B.C.  Coupled with the above are touts,  drug-pushers, informers and   sleepers,  such as the Littlejohns,  Wyman and Crinnion in the South.  Like it or not this is the  Security  Force  for which certain learned  gentlemen would have us conscript  Irish Gems  November 4,1974  Editor of The Irish People:  John Lonergan's literary gems of  Irish Wisdom does infuse in an  ingenious way, enthusiasm for Ireland  and help for solution of the problems.  Your paper attracts by the qualities  of truthful and sometimes sad current  incidents, which continue to tear the  hearts of the Irish and other events  that give the necessary ingredients for  victory.  William M. Lonergan  Granada Hills,  California  A Derry  Condemnation  The Co. Derry Anti-Internment  Co-ordinating Committee resents and  condemns the political censorship  exercised by the Minister for Posts  and Telegraphs, Dr. Cruise O'Brien,  on the journalists of RTE. In a  democratic state sovereignty resides  with the people. The people have a  right to the information necessary for  the exercise of their sovereignty at  the polls. Suppression of information  on the part of an elected official  therefore constitutes subversion of  the democratic process.  It is particularly important that our  fellow Irishmen be aware of the real  consequences, the privation and  suffering, of internees and their  families while the crime of  internment lasts. As citizens they can  then use the peaceful processes of  diplomacy and parliamentary action  to secure the final elimination of the  concentration camp at Long Kesh.  On the other hand, ignorance  induced in the South, through  censorship, will increase the isolation  and frustration in the North, with  consequent increased violence. It  would seem that Dr. O'Brien's actions  frequently intensify the conflict he  claims to oppose.  B. NOONE  Glen Road  Maghera, Co. Derry  the Irish mind. In this light Dr. Cruise  O'Brien may find it a little less  difficult to understand Senator Mary  Robinson's silence.  Fr. Denis Faul of Dungannon has  been far from being silent. Knowing  only too well the duplicity of the  British Establishment, he has recently  left us in no doubt as to what he  thinks of the R.U.C. as a  security  force ; his remarks make it  abundantly clear that this 95 p.c.  non-Catholic force  secure  their  own.  Of some 160 complaints lodged  against members of the R.U.C. for  brutality and misconduct not one  case of disciplinary action has been  forthcoming. Neither have any  searches been carried out in  safe  areas  for murder squads, in strange  contrast with night and day  harassment in West Belfast. This all  points to one thing-R.U.C. is but a  tool in General King's hand, closing  its ears and eyes when it suits the   pseudo-gang  assassination tactics of  Brigadier Frank Kitson.  Those who call for co-operation  using the Home Office propaganda  tag  security force  call for  co-operation with King and Kitson  and thereby insult the intelligence of  the Irish people.  Perhaps   Bishops   Buchanan   and  Philbin would care to comment on  the source in each of the following:   the  no-warning  anti-civilian  bombing of the Abercorn Restaurant  and McGurk's Bar; the callous 'Taxi  Murders  carried out during the reign  of Whitelaw; the Dublin  Bill  Bombs ; the Dublin-Monaghan plastic  explosions; the so-called  sectarian  murders ; the  no arrests  of those  mysterious and  invisible  murderers;  the  observation posts -assassination  posts uncovered near the homes of  Strasbourg witnesses. The Source in  all these cases could prove mightly  interesting  One presumes that  learned ecclesiastics heard of  Low  Intensity Operations  in Kenya,  Omar and Muscadet.  There is nothing ex-cathedra about  Irish bishops where taking sides with  the Crown Force is concemed-a  Catholic bishop once upon a time  dined with Major Strickland the very  night his native city was burned to  the ground by the  Security Forces.   His people in their own time gave him  his answer.  Evolution is a slow process and  leopards do not change their spots  overnight, nor for that matter over  fifty or sixty or even a hundred years.  Diarmaid 0 Suilleabhain Guaire,  Co. Loch Garman.  Bistops Misuse Irish People  Dear Sir,  I feel compelled to comment on  the latest warning from Bishop  Philbin to the young men of Ireland.  It never ceases to bewilder thoughtful  Irish people that spiritual leaders can  be so devoid of the ordinary'  intellectual and emotional drives  which inspire other Irishmen and lead  them to the primary national  problem, the first order of business  for every concerned citizen of the  nation-the eradication of the chronic  evil afflicting our country for so  long-England's insistence in  dominating the lives of the Irish  people.  John Mitchel, who, as a Derry  Protestant, provides a most striking  contrast to Derry's present Bishop  Daly, wrote that  good government is  the most cunning form of  government . Yet England in her  distain did not show the slightest  consideration towards her Irish slaves.  Well England knew she didn't have  to  The humiliations and savagery  perpetrated on our people should  have been enough to stir them into  total rebellion and complete victory  long ago, if it hadn't been for-the  constant admonition from clerics like  Bishop Philbin and Archbishop Troy  of Dublin, that the gates of hell  waited for those young men who  would 'try it out' with their ancient  enemy. Troy means nothing in Irish  history but Wolfe Tone whom he  tried to nickname  cut-throat Tone ,  is honoured every June by the Irish  people in their thousands. Yes and  even by the present junta of traitors  in Leinster House.  The mere passage of time does not  justify that which was evil in the  beginning. The unlawful usurpation  of any sod of Ireland and it's later  consolidation by thieving settlers,  shepherded by English soldiers would  have been checked and resolved in  1798 but for the interference of the  hierarchy on the side of these British  marauders who scoffed at the laws of  God and man. The Catholic hierarchy  of that day looked on silently,  without protest, at this huge  infringement of the Fifth and Seventh  Commandments of God. Would  Bishop Philbin condemn the men who  fought in the GPO in Dublin in 1916?  After all, Easter Week is as much a  part of this generation as the defense  of the Bogside, in August, 1969. Or  would he dare endorse Archbishop  Troy's slander of brave Tone? Would  he even associate himself with Bishop  Tickle's commendation of the English  murderers who left thirteen young  Derry men motionless in their own  blood?  Too long have the bishops misused  and manipulated the consciences of  the Irish people. Their influence in   every aspect of Irish life is paramount  and had it been identified with the  just, national aspirations of their  people could have contributed to the  achievement of Irish freedom,  centuries ago. These bishops,  however, chose to identify with the  tormentors of their own flocks. They  were not responsible to any Irish  authority but themselves and  therefore never had to give a reason  for their strange teaching that every  other nation was justified in fighting  for freedom from unlawful foreign  domination. But the Irish, they must  remain slaves.  Bishop Philbin   England, France  and America fought for their freedom  at the cost of great loss of life and  THEIR bishops applauded and prayed  for their men. If you cannot likewise  give spiritual succour and consolation  to the fighting men of Ireland, if you  cannot preach Christ an Irishman, as  Pope John exhorted, then for God's  sake, keep your silence.  Tnm Ouffey.  What The Hell  Are Some Of Us Doing?  The Editor  The Irish People  Bronx, New York  A Chara:  I am still stunned by the closing campaign efforts of the American-Irish  political candidates to garnish the Irish votes in New York. Moreover, I am  rather surprised at some of the people who endorsed the efforts of  candidates who failed to utter one word of behalf of our people in places  where it was needed most i.e. debates, T.V. ads, and the regular American  news media.  Our internees battered in Long Kesh and Crumlin Jail, and living in  caveman type conditions. The six counties of 'Occupied Ireland' in a state  of riot with people being shot down in the streets, and not one word  voiced in America's Fourth Estate by our august American-Irish politicians.  Were it not for the fact that I am faced with the reality of living in New  York, I would swear that I was taken back in time, and was, in fact,  reading Dublin newspapers rather than the American-Irish media. I felt sure  that such political bladder in respect to Irish freedom could only come  from the likes of Sean Lemass, Bob Brisco, Jack Lynch, Eamon DeValera,  and a few more such beauties- Remember 1916     Ireland Unfree Shall  Never Be At Peace - Six Divisions, Six Hours, Six  Counties - Remember James Connolly . The rhetoric was a little  different, and the political names were changed, but it was the same  political con job;  Let's use the six counties, it's good for a vote. It's what  the dumb Irish like to hear, but don't say it too loud .  Of all the unmitigated gall, and sacrilegious rhetoric I have ever perused,  this use of our oppressed people to con Irish voters is beyond contempt.  For Irishmen and Irish women who profess solidarity with our oppressed  people to lend their names to politicians who were willing to support the  State of Israel and Soviet Jews publicly, but utter no word in the American  news media about our bleeding and battered internees is a disgrace to the  Irish community.  With so many Irish voters involved, this was an opportune moment to  force the Irish question into the public arena, and I have to wonder if with  the chips down Ireland did not play a secondary role to political patronage  and opportunism.  To say I am appalled would be the understatement of all time; rather  should I get down on my knees, and ask God what Ireland did wrong to  deserve such shabby treatment from her own people, and those who claim  to have her best interest at heart.  Have we been fooled again by promises of help after the fact, but not  before? Are we yet so foolish that we will still settle for crumbs when we  could have demanded the whole loaf? Have some of our people used their  position in the Irish community to endorse candidates whose only  credibility comes from rhetoric in places where full exposure to the  American public is never achieved?  I hope you people are content with your effort, but I would remind you  that our internees are still living like dogs, and our people are suffering  more brutality than ever. Some of you have attained position in the Irish  community because of the present conflict, and only you can answer the  question as to whether you have abdicated the principals which should not,  and dare not, be placed second to personal gain, or to avoid political  embarrassment to public figures.  Man does not live on bread alone, and our people in 'Occupied Ireland'  can not be expected to continue the struggle unless our support Is both  verbal as well as materialistic.  We have missed the boat this trip, but let us hope we can learn from it,  and press home our voting power in 1975.  I suggest that those who have not read 'The McGarrity Papers  do so  now, and those of us who have could well do with a refresher course on  Irish power, and how best to use it.  We talk of the sellout of 1921, and Jack Lynch standing idly by. Just  what the hell are some of us doing?  Noel Malone,  Vice President  American Irish Repub. Army  P.S. If anyone reminds me of Congressional Resolutions; I'll remind them  that we are still waiting for positive results, and then I'll ask them:  Are  the Soviet Jews still waiting for action, and how many Americans read  Congressional Records?   lt;js the British treat Francis Stagg,  what an outcry from the Labour  Party we could expect on the  question of human rights.  Is it not time the British Labour  Military  Rule  The British Foreign Secretary, Mr.  A. Callaghan is quoted as stating  We  should not remain silent on issues of  human rights and political freedom.  We will speak and act wherever, and  whenever, we think it to be right.   It is not difficult to credit that Mr.  Callaghan personally would hesitate  to remain silent when such issues are  raised. We recall his warm humanity  and the deftness which marked his  visits to Belfast and Derry pre-1970.  But how are we to reconcile his  statement with the present policy of  the British Labour Party in  Government? This government  reputedly the champion of the  oppressed, the standard bearer of  democracy, dedicated to justice and  Freedom; this government maintains  the Tory policy of internment in the  N.E. of Ireland-even compounds it  with torture and terrorism.  The British Government inveighs  against military govemment-but  submits to it in N.E.

The  chemical, which can be used from  spray cans, is intended to cause acute  irritation to the skin, eyes, nose and  throat.  It replaces the widely-used CS gas  and has a much greater  discomfort  factor.  Officially it has never been  used on the public anywhere in the  world, but tests on rabbits in the US  show that high concentrations can  seriously damage the eyes. Some of  the results of the tests are still  classified, and the Army's move is  bound to raise demands for this  information to be published.  The Ministry of Defence said  yesterday that CR would be used in  Ulster only in certain  special  circumstances -serious riot  situations. The ministry's view has  always been that CR is no more toxic  than CS. The reason for the change is  that CS   dispelled as a gas-is  indiscriminate and the security forces  have been accused of gassing people,  sometimes in their homes, by  exploding too many canisters. CR can  be dissolved in a liquid for spraying or  in a kind of jelly to make foam riot  barriers.  The Army can dispel the new  chemical from water cannon or from  what is known as a Self-Protection  Aid Device, a small canister carried by  a soldier which works like a  water-pistol. The concentration of the  agent in these two devices is small;  one part in 2,000 (for the spray can)  and one part in 40,000 for the water  cannon. It can also be dispensed as a  gas.  Some scientists and doctors are  concerned about the possible  long-term effects of CR. The  Himsworth Committee, which  reported on the medical effects of CS  gas in 1969 and 1971, recommended  that the results of research on any  future agent should be freely available  to scientists outside government  departments. Many scientists feel that  this recommendation has not been  complied with.  The Ministry of Defence, however,  claims that it has. It says that tests  done in the US and at the Ministry's  chemical and biological warfare  centre at Porton Down, Wiltshire,  have provided the necessary answers.  Unlike CS, the new agent has high  chemical stability and might form  highly reactive and poisonous  substances in the course of passage  through the body. Experts say these  should be long-term tests after severe  exposure to CR.  CR was approved by the Defence  Ministry in November last year, but  until two weeks ago it was authorised  only for use at the Maze Internment  camp which was burnt down on  October 15. During the riot at the  camp prisoners, used to the effects of  CS, claimed that a new agent was  used on them. They say it was more  irritating to the eyes and had a  paralysing effect. The Army denies  that it has used CR yet.  The Leading Irish Steak House in the Bronx  AGO0DPLACETOTAKETHE FAMILY  14 West Fordham Road, Bronx  (Just Off Jerome Avenue)  FEATURING SIZZLING STEAKS, CHOPS AND BURGERS  ENTERTAINMENT  WEDNESDAY thru SUNDAY  Dining Room Open Till 2 a.m.  YOUR HOST: JOE CORNYN FO 4-9824  British Terror Tactics  In Nationalist Areas  POWER VACUUM IN NORTH  The political vacuum in the Six  Counties of Northern Ireland  continues to grow and the terrible  thing about it is that it cannot be  filled while the present state of affairs  continues. On the one hand a war  situation exists between the I.R.A.  and the British Army. Arising from  this, the latter, in the manner of ail  occupying armies the world over, are  engaged in a brutal campaign of  harassment against the Nationalist  population. This has the classic  objective of all such campaigns, which  is to detach support from the guerilla  army by means of terror. History  should have told Britain by now  (provided of course, that the thick  Saxon mentality is capable of  absorbing the lesson of history) that  such terror tactics invariably achieve  the contrary result. There is an  additional factor in this war of  liberation which is unique, and also  sinister. It is the Loyalist part of the  equation. By that is meant, the  Loyalist para-military groups and  their accomplices in the British  S.A.S., who are engaged in sectarian  assassinations of innocent Catholic  members of the population. If the  Nationalist areas were not subjected  to the saturation tactics and  harassment of the British Army, the  I.R.A. would be quite capable of  dealing with these Loyalist thugs who  shoot old men and children from  speeding cars, and disappear into the  safety of the Shankill, Sandy Row  and Rathcoole areas.  BRITAIN TRIES TO JUSTIFY  ROLE OF PEACEMAKER  Britain's Harold Wilson and Merlyn  Rees, ably abetted by the Southern  Irish Government assert that the  British military presence in Ireland is  necessary to prevent a Civil War. The  tactics * of the British Army of  constant harassment of the  Nationalist areas and leaving the way  clear for the sectarian murder gangs  to do their work, is a sure recipe for  the Civil War which they claim they  are trying to prevent. So far, the  I.R.A. has refrained from retaliation.  Britain would like it to retaliate, and  thus justify her role as alleged  peacemaker to world opinion.  However, as the only protector of the  Nationalist  population against both  the British Army and the Loyalist  murder gangs, the I.R.A. has a  specific role to play and is deeply  conscious of the feelings of the  people it defends. If the sectarian  murder gangs push their luck too far,  they may well find that they have  invited a retribution they will not  relish.  In the meantime the fight in  Occupied Ireland is costing England  so much in menand money, that she  will have to give up this last desperate  attempt of hers to get the nationalist  people to accept peace at any price.  Her stark naked terror of civilians  such as in Kenya, Aden and as advised  by Kitson will not pay off in Ireland.

The executive of the North's  Republican Clubs demanded  yesterday that doctors who had  treated men injured in prison  disturbances release details of their  wounds.  Mr. Jim Sullivan, who represents  some 120 men detained in Long  Kesh, wants the prisoners to be  allowed to state which representative  will visit them, rather than be forced  to accept visits from Assemblymen  chosen by Mr. Rees, but  who in  many cases advocate policies being  rejected by the inmates.   He is also demanding the Governor  of Long Kesh, Mr. Robert Truesdale,  whom he accuses of being a  sadist,   be removed from office.  On Thursday night British soldiers  in the Falls were  lifting everyone  over the age of 14 and holding them  for hours,  the conference was told.   Attempts are being made to  impose unofficial curfews in the Falls,  Ardoyne and New Lodge,  said Mr.  Seamus Lynch, a member of the  executive, which also charges the  army with failing to meet the legal  requirements about notifying relatives  if someone is injured or moved from  one police or army base to another.  Mr. Sullivan disputed claims from  some loyalist groups that Protestant  prisoners in Long Kesh did not  support republicans in the burning of  buildings.   The 'Red Hand Commandos'  engaged in burning huts in concert  with republican prisoners,  he said.  The Republican Clubs named Hugh  Walsh as being in danger of losing the  sight in one eye, and to have had  three teeth lodged in the roof of his  mouth after having a gas canister fired  at point-blank range in his face. It  was, they said, three hours before he  received hospital treatment.  They said three prisoners were  treated for injuries caused when   barbed-wire strands were lodged  round the necks of prisoners trying to  escape the inslaught of the British  troops.    Total known cases treated at the  Royal Victoria Hospital was 70 with  more arriving as late as midnight on  Wednesday.  They also understood  109 men were treated in Musgrave  Park Hospital, and that three cases  were flown for specialised treatment  to Altnaqelvin Hospital, Derry.  rFLOOR SCRAPING  AND  REFINISHING  EXPERT  I   WORKMANSHIP  CALL ANYTIME  'X   P  John Cooper 212-881-5168'  J j Jim O'Gara 212-367-7128J  New Books On Ireland  FREEDOM STRUGGLE  1  By The Provisional IRA  EIRE NUA  By Ruairi 0 Bradaigh   150   100  ULSTER  100  POSTAGE 50t EXTRA FOR 2 BOOKS  WRITE:  THE IRISH NORTHERN AID COMMITTEE  273 E. 194th ST., BRONX, NEW YORK  10458        J

        <pagetext>I  Will Investors Ever Again Trust Dublin?  DUBLIN-Europe's biggest zinc  and lead mine, located at Navan in  Eire's County Meath, is lying idle.  The Canadian and European investors  who own it cannot raise the money  they need to work it, because the  Irish government has not granted  them a lease. Although the mine  would constitute the biggest  industrial investment ever made in  Eire, where jobs are scarce, the  government has spent almost four  years weighing the application for a  permit to work the deposit. It  recently set forth the terms on which  it would grant the lease, terms which  the mining company promptly  spurned as  grievously onerous and  unreasonable,  not to mention illegal.  All Dublin wants is half the equity for  a song, and the right to take  four-fifths of the gross profits.  The tribulations of Tara  Exploration   Development Ltd.,  which owns the 77-million-ton  lead-zinc deposit at Navan, illustrate  the difficulties which hard-rock  miners today face worldwide. From  British Columbia to Australia via  Norway and Morocco, governments  have taken to aping OPEC. Ignoring  the difference between the highly  volatile base metals market and the  rigged oil market, these governments  are writing mining leases that are  tantamount to expropriation in the  best Arab manner.  MINISTER SUED  The Irish case perhaps is unusual in  that the Socialist Minister involved  has displayed such a degree of  arbitrariness that he is being sued in  the courts for unconstitutional acts.  In other ways, though, it is typical  enough to serve as a test case. By  trying to go too far, the Irish  government is demonstrating  experimentally, as it were, at what  point mining investors balk. Not only  is the Navan deposit lying unworked,  but also Ireland's mining industry as a  whole is grinding to a halt.  Prospecting has virtually stopped.  Plans for a mineral-processing plant  have been abandoned. Foreign  investors are withdrawing, and the oil  companies have indicated that on  terms like these, they couldn't care  less what lies beneath the Irish Sea.  The Irish mining industry is a  recent creation. Liberal mining laws,  enacted by Conservative governments,  attracted enterprising Irish-Canadian  prospectors to the Isle in the 'Sixties.  When they struck it rich, they were  followed by the international mining  majors. Some  130 million was spent  on prospecting over the past decade.  It turned up enough lead, zinc,  copper and silver to make  concentrates a leading Irish export.  By last year, 1,000 licenses were held  by prospectors using the latest  geochenrical and electronic  techniques to locate that proverbial  crock o' gold hidden under the Ould  Sod.  Four Irish mines currently are in  production. Avoca Mines, controlled  by Discovery Mines of Canada,  operates in County Wicklow.  Silvermines, which is 75 -owned by  International Mogul, raises lead and  zinc in Tipperary. Northgate  Exploration, a Canadian concern  listed on the NYSE, mines lead-zinc  at Tynagh in Galway and copper at  Gortdrum, Tipperary. All those  discoveries were dwarfed by the rich  ore body located at Navan, not 100  miles from Dublin, by Tara, an  Irish-Canadian company closely  associated with Northgate.  UNSUCCESSFUL BID  Tara's shares are listed in Toronto  and London. From 50 cents before  the Navan strike, they zoomed to  29  earlier this year, during an  unsuccessful takeover bid by British  and Canadian interests. After the bid,  Tara's ownership was divided between  Cominco of Vancouver, which holds  17 , Charter Consolidated of London  with 14 , Canada's Noranda Mines  with 19 , and Northgate and the  Irish directors, who hold about 40 .  When the dispute erupted with   .ublin over a lease, trading in the  stock was briefly suspended. The  shares currently trade around  14.    The mines* at Tynagh, Silvermines  and Gortdrum were opened up under  the favorable legislation passed in  1956. Then in 1967, additional  incentives were offered, notably, the  promise of a 20-year tax holiday for  any mine that went into production  before 1986. Feverish prospecting  activity ensued, culminating in the  discovery at Navan in November  1970. Dublin gave Tara firm  undertakings that a suitable lease  would be granted, so the company  went ahead with development. It sank   25 million at the site and planned to  spend all told almost  100 million to  bring the mine into production by  next year.  The project was to raise 2.5'million  tons of ore a year, yielding 470,000  tons of concentrates. At current  prices, they would be worth about   100 million, or 1.5  of Eire's gross  national product. Canadian banks, led  by the Toronto Dominion Bank,  stood ready to provide senior  financing once the lease was official.  REPLACED BY COALITION  Things started to go wrong with  the Irish elections of February 1973.  After 16 years in office, the  Conservatives were ousted by a  coalition of the Fine Gael and the  Labour Party. A Labour politician,  Justin Keating, took over the Ministry  of Industry and Commerce, which  controls mining. Suddenly in  September 1973, without  consultation or warning, Mr. Keating  abolished the 20-year tax holiday that  had attracted mining capital to  Ireland. This reversal did so much  damage to Eire's reputation for fair  dealing that the Prime Minister, Liam  Cosgrave, issued repeated assurances  that taxation would be reasonable  and in line with that of other  countries.     That had a consequence the Irish  nationalists had not foreseen. Since  Irish mining-shares had slumped when  the tax-break ended, and the  government now was promising that  taxation would be no worse than in  other lands, foreign mining giants  moved in. Their target was Tara and  its rich Navan'ore body, Cominco,  which belongs to the Canadian Pacific  group, and Charter Consolidated,  controlled by the powerful Anglo  American Corp., in February 1974  bid  25 apiece for Tara shares. Many  Irish stockholders sold out, and the  Irish directors could only fight off the  bid by enlisting the aid of Noranda  Mines. The bid failed, but 51  of  Tara stock passed under foreign  control. In the process, it was  demonstrated that the mining world  valued Tara at well over  160 million.  Under its new owners, Tara pressed  ahead with development work at  Navan. It completed a 1,000-foot  access shaft and a 4,000-foot service  ramp, and started work on the  concentrator complex. Then, in order  to clinch its financing arrangements,  it asked the government for the  promised lease. On July 8, Mr.  Keating unveiled his modest  proposals. He wanted 49  of the  equity, of which 25  would be paid  for by issue of the lease and 24  in  cash. But the sum he had in mind was   9.6 million. Thus, the government  would pay  9.6 million for 49  of a  company which the market had just  valued at over  160 million. Viewed  another way, it was offering  2.50 for  shares which Cominco and Charter  Consolidated had offered (and paid)   25.  UNIQUELY EXORBITANT  There was more. The government  would charge royalties on a scale that  would jslide from 4  to 20 , as  maximum production was attained.  Moreover, it would take 50  of the  profits as corporate tax. A simple  calculation shows that far from being  comparable with the government   take  in other countries, these levies  were uniquely exorbitant. Out of  every  100 of gross profits, the Irish  government would take  20 in  royalty, plus  40 In profits tax (50   of the remaining  80). Then, as  shareholder, it would get  19.60,  which is 49  of the net profits of  40  after tax. In all, its take would run to  - 79.60. If it levied royalty at the  ' more moderate rate of 15 , it would  still claim  78.70 out of every  100  of operating profit.  That would compare with a total  government take from  100 of  mining revenues of  40 in Italy,   47.70 in Canada,  48 in the U.S.,  and  56.20 in Socialist Norway.  Moreover, it compared with only  10  that prospectors were told they  would have to pay when they first  went to Eire in quest of minerals a  gasfield off Cork, in a region,  moreover, where many bore holes  have been failures.  The Confederation of Irish  Industries concludes:  The  government must therefore present a  package of terms which will be more  attractive (not less) than those  available off other Northwestern  European shores at the present time.   By trying to impose in advance the  few years ago. Granted that promises  sortuof fms NorwaY could get away  with   after   major   oil   discoveries,  0 gt;i *.* ****** ,  of a tax holiday had been forgotten  with the change in government, the  present Irish administration seemed  to be overlooking its commitment to  impose  comparable  mining taxes  and to issue Tara an acceptable lease.  Accordingly, the company rejected  the terms it was offered and started  long, and so far fruitless, negotiations  for a better deal. Meantime, in the  absence of a lease, financing could  not be arranged and there was no cash  to proceed with development of the  mine. So on August 16, it was put on  a  care and maintenance basis,  and  most workers were laid off. Having  been advised by legal counsel that the  Minister's demand for 49  of its  equity at bargain prices was  unconstitutional, Tara sued him  before the High Court. It asked for a  court order compelling the Minister  to issue a mining lease on reasonable  terms. Into the bargain, it sought  damages, which could run to  72  million, to compensate it for the long  wait for a mining lease.   NO CONFIDENCE   MOTION  That was quite enough to bring the  Tara brouhaha into the foreground of  turbulent Irish politics (the Cosgrave  government now faces a motion of   no confidence ). Exploiting the  now-familiar rhetoric of  natural-resources demagogy, the  Labour Minister has won the  vociferous support of  conservationalists and leftists. Dublin  is plastered with Sinn Fein signs,   Nationalize Tar l Ireland's wealth  for the Irish people    As sometimes happens when Celtic  eloquence gets free rein, the mere  facts are lost to sight. The way they  tell it in the pubs along O'Connel  Street, the Navan deposit is really  worth two billion Irish pounds ( 4.8  billion), whereas at today's prices, a  few hundred million dollars would be  nearer the mark. The Minister is  credited with defending this national  treasure from foreign freebooters.  On the contrary, Mr. Keating has  -been trying to enlist the support of  the foreign shareholders in Tara to  oust the Irish group that exerts  control. In September, he pressingly  invited Cominco, Charter  Consolidated and Noranda to meet  . him in Dublin. His idea was that since  they owned 51  of the stock, they  could join forces, overthrow the Irish  directors and then come to terms  with him for a lease. When Noranda  flatly refused to attend any meeting  in the absence of the Irish directors,  the scheme for a palace revolution fell  through.  In demanding a  carried interest   in the Navan mine, Mr. Keating says  he is following the pattern Norway  has set in fixing terms for North Sea  oil permits. Indeed, the Irish Labour  Party would like to set up a state  minerals authority modelled on  Norway's Statoil, which would own  the 49  stake in Navan and a similar  carried interest in all future mining  leases and offshore oil permits. A  batch of 20-25 exploration blocks on  Ireland continental shelf is to be put  up for bids before the end of the  year, and the oil companies will  probably be asked to accept the terms  being proposed to Tara.  MAY OVERPLAY HAND  If so, Dublin might well be  overplaying its hand. Although many  Irishmen credit their offshore waters  with wealth equal to that of the  North Sea, geologists point out that  the sea bed is mostly solid rock,  without promise of oil or gas. The  only waters likely to cover  hydrocarbons are 650-1,000 feet  deep, and thus beyond the range of  today's technology. So far the only  DwiHon g pf-jiydrocarbons  is;a ;small   Dublin is out-Heroding Herod.  In any case, oil companies can  afford to take certain risks as long as  OPEC succeeds in keeping the price  of crude around  10 a barrel.  Hard-rock miners, in contrast, are  looking for metals, the price of which  fluctuates wildly. Right now, base  metal quotations are falling sharply,  endangering the future of all marginal  Irish mines. By choosing this moment  to force through Draconian terms,  and to renege on official  undertakings, Dublin risks killing an  industry that was juststirring to life.  COULD FACE SHUTDOWN  Already Avoca Mines, hit by the  crash in copper prices, has retrenched  on half its workforce and could face  closure. Irish mines are barely  profitable; anyhow they will be  worked out within the decade. If the  industry is to survive, more mines will  have to be found, by keeping up the  pace of exploration and by using the  expertise and equipment drawn to  Eire during the minerals boom. Yet  by   the -j  since the terms for the Navan lease X  were made public, all prospecting has   ,  ceased. Investor-owned companies 2  cannot agree to risk millions of       dollars in the uncertain quest for  minerals if they know they will be  despoiled of 80  of whatever they  find.  The  problem  goes well  beyond  Ireland's shores. It concerns all those Jjp  governments which presume that they S  can copy OPEC, if they have any jjj.  natural resources to sell. The point is    best    made   this   month  Association for Economic Geology, a  group of  Irish geologists who have eg  drawn the lessons of Dublin's recent       gt;  ventures into natural-resources bluff:   The mines of the future will be at  greater depth and will give very little,  if indeed any, surface response. The  exploration programs required to find  such deposits will be intensive and .  long-term and will, therefore, involve  much greater expenditure. They will  require   a   solid   fiscal   and   legal  framework.    Because    of    their  long-term  nature, they will require  guarantees that the ground rules, once  established, will not be changed.  The courts now must decide  whether, in Tara's case, the rules were  changed unconstitutionally. Whatever  the upshot, Tara is condemned to go  ahead, because it has sunk so much  money in its mine on the strength of  official promises. What is at stake is  whether investors ever again will be  willing to place their trust in Dublin's  word.

        <pagetext>00  LU  -J  0.  O  LU  O.   C  CO  Inquiry Into Death  Of Internee Sought  n     . L Jema ds  4 Remembrance   British Secretary  LU  X  o  E   gt;  O  The shooting of Hugh Coney has  brought varying reaction in the North  ranging from a call by the Civil Rights  Association for the arrest of Mr. Rees,  the Northern. Secretary, to a demand  for a full independent inquiry by the  Bishop of Derry, Most Rev. Edward  Daly.  The Bishop of Derry, Dr. Daly,  demanded a full and independent  inquiry into the killing of Hugh  Coney, who was shot dead while  attempting to escape from Long  Kesh.  Extending his sympathy to the  man's family, Dr. Daly said:  I have  asked that prayers be offered for the  repose of his soul at all Masses in the  city this evening. I am also asking that  prayers be offered at these Masses for  the ending of internment without  trial.  TRIBUNAL   I demand a full, independent  inquiry into this latest killing. As long  as internment continues and Long  Kesh continues to exist in its present  form the agony of the North will only  get worse. Once again I appeal for an  immediate ending of internment  without trial.   Mr. Oliver Napier, Alliance Party  leader, said in a statement that  each  incident of this nature reinforces the  argument for the establishment of an  'independent tribunal,' to investigate  incidents of public controversy on  this kind.   He said he would be asking Mr.  Rees to instruct the present,  government inquiry set up to  investigate the Maze disturbances of  last month, to include in its terms of  reference the events of Tuesday night.  The Civil Rights Association in  their statement said that Mr. Rees  ought to be arrested on a charge of  murder because  as the British  Government Minister responsible for  Northern Ireland, he bears the  responsibility for the behaviour of his  troops.       The Association described the  death of Mr. Coney as  cold-blooded  murder.   The statement also said that Mr.  Coney had spent two years and four  months of the last three years of his  life in prison  for doing nothing.   They say he. was arrested at the  beginning of 1972 and held in  Crumlin Road Jail for one year. He  was then released but was re-arrested  in June, 1973, and detained.  E (  StosS  Gulf Tankers Expected  To Return To Irish Ports  DUBLIN-Two giant oil tankers  ordered out of Irish territorial waters  Tuesday night because the  government here feared a possible  collision in Bantry Bay, Cork, are  now expected to return today to  unload their crude at the Gulf Oil  Corp.'s Whiddy Island transshipment  and oil storage terminal.  Flor Crowley, an opposition  member of Parliament for the Cork  region, charged that Peter Barry, the  minister for transport and power, had  overreacted in his decision to instruct  the VLCC tankers to leave the area.  Mr. Crowley, in a statement, said  that all experts recognized that  Bantry Bay was  absolutely safe  for  the anchorage of five large tankers at  the same time. When one considered  that 50 per cent of the business at  Bantry Bay was by charter,  it is not  good enough to order ships to steam  around indefinitely.   Mr. Barry's instruction to the two  supertankers to quit the bay area  came after he had made a helicopter  tour of the coastal region around the  Gulf oil terminal following last  weekend's major oil spillage when  another tanker was taking on crude  REILLf  BAR AND GRILL  1776 East Tremont Ave  Bronx, N.York, N.Y.  TA-2-9335  Compliments of John Reilly  for Spain.  It appears that the government,  ,and specifically Mr. Barry's own  ministry, were not aware that five  giant tankers were in Bantry Bay, the  location of the Gulf terminal, at the  same time.  This, the minister has since said,  was in contravention of an  understanding reached with the  company.  The minister reported to the  cabinet that he feared a possible  collision between two or more of the  tankers, although there are  unconfirmed reports from Bantry  that Mr. Barry himself had refused to  implement a recommendation last  weekend by one of his own senior  officials asking that all ships be  ordered out of the area and that  operations at the terminal should  cease pending a detailed investigation  into the oil spill. Work was continuing  on Thursday in clearing up the  spillage, and Gulf Oil has already  indicated that it will meet in full all  legitimate claims for compensation.  The company will also give its own  definitive estimate of the full extent  of the spill.       AWAITING REPORT  The government is awaiting its  report on the incident, and officials  claim that provisional findings suggest  that it occurred through a faulty valve  on the tanker Universe Leader loading  at the terminal. The spillage,  according to current official  estimates, may have exceeded some  600,000 gallons.  The government meanwhile, has  now decided, following this latest oil  spill, to establish a port authority or  other supervisory board for Bantry,  one of Europe's largest deepwater  ports.

Michael Frawley, 884-0261  Co-Chairmen   John   O'Malley,   933-7476;   Danny  McMahon, 822-2470  The following is a press statement  issued by the Northern Ireland Civil  Rights Association (NICRA) through  its American Representative: The  National Association for Irish  Freedom (NAIF).  In a statement issued today  (November 6, 1974) the Northern  Ireland Civil Rights Association has  called for the immediate arrest of  Merlyn Rees on a charge of murder.  As the Minister responsible for  Northern Ireland, he bears the  responsibility for the behavior of his  troops. In cold-bloodedly murdering  Hugh Gerard Coney, 24, an internee  in Long Kesh, Mr. Rees has declared  open season on all internees. While  the British people eulogized their  soldiers for escaping from Nazi  concentrations camps in the last war,  thirty years later British soldiers  gunned down an innocent man who  tried to do exactly the same thing.  In our opinion, it is the express  duty of any internee who has been  unjustly imprisoned without charge  or trial to attempt to escape. Hugh  Coney has spent two years and four  months of the last three years of his  Jife imprisoned for doing nothing. In  January, 1972 he was arrested and  kept in the Crumlin Road Jail for one  year. He was released with no charges  preferred. In June, 1973 he was  interned, but not before being badly  beaten by the Royal Ulster  Constabulary in the Omagh RUC  station. According to our sources the  figures for the people injured have  been grossly underestimated by the  Northern Ireland government. There  may be as many as 100 men injured  in the aftermath-mainly from  Belfast.  The Northern Ireland Civil Rights  Association has contacted  international organizations asking  them to protest this murder. NICRA  says that it is obvious that the British  government has added Interment  without charge or trial to its policy of  Internment without charge or trial.  The National Association for Irish  Freedom joins in this call for the  arrest of Merlyn Rees. In addition, we  ask that all people write their local  Congressman and Senators to demand  that they call for an immediate end to  the policy of Internment without  charge or trial being practiced by the  government of Great Britain.  BAR MAIDS   Irish born Bar  maids   Experience not  necessary   will train. .  NOLAN'S  SLIGO HOUSE  South Amboy, N.J.  Living accommodations  available if required.  Jimmie Steele  Seamus, James, Jimmie. His name in all it's forms is a close description of  the man. Dedicated to the ideal of Gaelic culture and language. Stern and  unyielding in his patriotism. Fun-loving and friendly he was quietly religious,  compassionate and charitable.  Jimmie's life story would fill several volumes, so this is but a brief sketch.  He was a member of Fianna na hEireann in the New Lodge Road area of  Belfast towards the end of the Black and Tan War and during the several years  of the terror-program against the abandoned nationalist minority in the six  Northern counties.  As a member of the IRA in the mid-twenties he worked unceasingly to  rebuild the IRA in Nationalist Belfast. In his youth and early manhood he was  already something of a legend in his home area. During the constant raids and  arrests his public defiance and courage were outstanding. Seized in a round up  in ,1934, his prison fight, twenty years in all, began.  He spent a year or so in prison at that time, and later in 1936, he with Billy  Mulholland from Old Park Road, and myself, were detained for three months  in Crumlin Road Prison.  In 1937 a meeting of the BattJion Staff of which he was Adjutant was  raided by the Special Branch and police. Battlion Staff with one exception  were arrested. The exception was later tried, found guilty and shot as an  informer.  Receiving long terms of penal servitude, they spent months in solitary  confinement, naked, on bread and water, plus periods of hunger strfke to  back their demands for political treatment.  During a  peaceful  period in the prison, he and Hugh Mc Ateer of Derry  and two others  went over the wall  one morning. The wartime black-out  covering their escape, they made their way on foot to my parents' home, and  were supplied with food and clothing while contact was made with the IRA.  My parents are both dead, and safe from British vengeance.  For the next three months, at the height of the 'Rourties campaign, Jimmie  was now a National leader in the IRA. The intense man-hunt to recapture him  was recognition by the enemy of the importance of his leadership, and finally  he was arrested by a huge raiding party in the New Lodge area and taken back  to Crumin Road prison, being the last political prisoner to go free in 1947.  Immediately upon release, he brought together the remnants of the Belfast  Battalion and the rebuilding began anew. Lack of public support shortened  the IRA efforts in the mid-fifties and towards the end Jimmie was again in  prison.  Released again in 1958 when support for the IRA was all but dead in  Ireland, he succeeded in holding together the greatly reduced numbers of the  IRA in Belfast. Concentrating on the National Graves Association, organizing  Easter Week Commemorations and IRA reunions, writing and publishing IRA  booklets, songs and poems he was the main force that kept the Republican  M6vement alive in the North.    During the next nine or ten years he came into conflict with the IRA  leadership, publically denouncing what he considered their betrayel of the  principles of the IRA and subverting it into extreme left political activities  with Communist Party connection. He was abruptly dismissed from the IRA.  Shortly afterwards the division occurred that led to the formation of the  Provisional IRA, with Jimmie among the top leadership. He died of a heart  attack in August 9th, 1970.  Jimmie and Anna Crawford, boy and girlhood sweethearts married in their  early Fourties. A son was born to them who they named Colm, a wonderful  crowing reward for the trials of the past. Colm was nine years when he was  killed by a hit and run driver a few yards from his home.      From Jimmie's letter:    28 Condara Street, Belfast, 25/12/61   You will understand how Anna and I feel about this awful tragedy that has  befallen us. It is too tragic to express in words and our hearts are so sore with  pain and grief of our loss. Even yet we cannot realize that Colm has gone  from us. He was such a comfort and joy to us, so lively and full of fun, singing  from morning till night or reciting poems. It is a heavy cross we are asked to  bear this time-yet we know that God must have some good reason for taking  him back from us so soon-   For the remainder of his life, summer or winter, Jimmie daily visited his  son's graveside. They rest together now. Anna remains at home, strong and  reliant, with her memories. Memories that are sweet, yet perhaps sometimes  bitter. Our hearts are with her particularly at Christmas time. Her address is  still 28 Clondara Street, Belfast.

        <pagetext>'I Was Not  Ward's  Boyfriend  The mystery surrounding the  private life of convicted mass  murderer, Judith Ward, has led to  many speculative stories about her  friends and contacts during her stay  in Ireland.  Her claim that she married Michael  McVerry, the formerProvisional IRA  0/C in South Armagh, has already  been denied by McVerry's parents  and the records at the Irish Register  Office.  And last night, a story that her real  boy friends in the Provisional  movement was Long Kesh internee  Eugene Moore was vehemently denied  by him.  Mr. Moore, now living with his wife  and child in Dundalk, insisted that he  had never met Judith Ward and was at  no time a member of the Provos.  A butcher in a Dundalk  supermarket, Mr. Moore (34) was  interned during the 1956-62 IRA  campaign and was again  lifted   during the big roundup on August 9,  1971, and Interned in Long Kesh. He  was released in April, 1972.  During Judith Ward's trial at  Wakefield Court it was stated that she  had visited him in Long Kesh. But last  night he said he had never met  anybody fitting her description.   This has left me in a terrible  predicament. I am in no way in  sympathy with what she has done,   added Mr. Moore, who said he had  not been actively involved with the  IRA since 1969.  The dealership of  both wings will confirm that,  he  added.  Since the trial began his house has  been besieged by English reporters.  'They said their sources in the British  Special Branch told them I was  connected with Judith Ward. I don't  know where they got their  information.   I have asked numerous friends in  Dundalk and Newry about Miss Ward  but nobody knows anything about  her,  said Mr. Moore.  The Moore family used to make  regular visits to his mother and father  in Newry but now these have  stopped.   With these stories flying around  there is every possibility that I will be  lifted again by the British and thrown  into Long Kesh. Twice is enough,  he  added.  Mr. Justice Waller, the judge in the  Judith Ward case, was surrounded by  a tight security screen yesterday after  he had sentenced her at Wakefield  Crown Court.  Ward is expected to start her  30-year jail sentence in a secure part  of a men's prison. But when the  conversion of E Wing at Durham jail  as a women's prison is completed she  is likely to join Myra Hindley, the  Moors murderer, and other women  required to be kept in top security  conditions.  And former Chief of Staff of the  Provisional IRA, Mr. Sean Mac  Stiofain yesterday denied ever having  met Judith Ward, as claimed by her  brother, David, yesterday.  Her brother David had claimed that  while he and Miss Ward were living in  Sandymount, Dublin,  one of her  many visitors was Sean Mac Stiofain.  Last night Mr. Mac Stiofain said:  I  deny categorically having ever met  Miss Judith Ward, much less visited  her in a flat in Sandymount. If my  information is correct, she and her  brother lived in this flat around the  time I was incarcerated in the Curragh  Camp.   Broken Pipe Led To  Huge Dock Inferno  A fractured pipeline to a  roadtanker caused the gas leak which  lead to the huge blaze at the  Calor-Kosangas gas-bottling depot at  Dublin's North Wall early yesterday.  But forensic examination have still  failed to discover where the spark  came from to ignite the fire, the city's  worst in many years.  One theory being investigated was  that the blaze was caused by a hot  point on the exhaust pipe of the  tanker being filled. The ignition had  been switched off before loading  began.  Night workmen had turned off all  electrical equipment, shut off gas  valves and set the sprinkler system in  operation before leaving the premises.  The gas depot is quite close to  major oil stores, and firemen  prevented the blaze from spreading  and igniting three containers in the  yard, of each containing 400 tons of  gas.  Sinn Fein  Demands  End To  British Rule  Mr. Ruairi O'Bradaigh, President of  Sinn Fein (Kevin Street) issued the  following statement on November  6th condemning the death of Hugh  Cooney of Coalisland, Co. Tyrone.  The murder of Hugh Gerard  Coney, (age 24), Coalisland, Co.  Tyrone, by British troops at Long  Kesh Internment Camp, and the  further brutalizing of unarmed  prisoners by these same troops for the  second time in three weeks, adds a  further chapter to the infamy of  internment without trial in Ireland.  Mr. Rees and his government have  shown in words and deeds that their  concern for their guard dogs is greater  than that for the human beings who  fill their concentration camps,  irrespective of whether they are  Republicans or  Loyalists ,  sentenced prisoners or internees.  It is time to call not just for an end  to the abomination which is Long  Kesh but also for the final closing  down of that British rule which  requires internment in every decade  to maintain itself.  No British Military Inquiry or  other investigation short of a full  International Inquiry into Long Kesh  will have the slightest credence with  the Irish people.  Sincere sympathy is offered to the  relatives, comrades and friends of the  dead internee on behalf of the entire  Republican Movement.  Recital November 24  NEW YORK, N.Y.-Ray DeVoll,  tenor soloist with the NEW YORK  PRO MUSICA, Baltimore Symphony,  Rochester Symphony, and countless  other orchestras and opera  companies, will present an evening of  Renaissance, Elizabethan, Baroque,  and Romantic songs at Alice Tully  Hall on Sunday, November 24 at 8:00  P.M. Mr. DeVoll will be assisted by  pianist Allen Rogers and lutenist  Lucy Cross.  The program is drawn from the  wide background of Ray DeVoll's  unusual repertoire and ranges from  the works of Italian Renaissance  composers Peri and Mazzaferrata to,  the lovely Elizabethan lute songs of  Dowland, Ford, andBartlettjo songs  Continued on Page 13  But there was a series of explosions  from small cylinders as they were  hurled hundreds of feet into the night  sky, lit by a ball of blue and yellow  flames. Two people were injured.  One of them, Mr. Martin Olwell, a  fireman attacked to Tara Street  station, was discharged after  treatment. The other man, Michael  Walsh (26), an RTE technician, was  detained in the Richmond Hospital  with head injuries. He lives at Elgin  Road and is a native of Foxford, Co.  Mayo.  Company executives and Garda  forensic experts sifted through the  charred gas cylinders in the road  loading yard where the fire was  contained by up to 50 firemen. Five  road tankers were burnt out in the  blaze, a large number of small  cylinders were blown apart and a  workshop was also badly burnt.  The inferno forced more than 200  residents of Alexandra Road area to  leave their homes.

Company engineers examined the  scene to assess the cost, but no figure  has yet been put on the damage  caused. There was speculation that  the figure could run into hundreds of  thousands of pounds.  A spokesman for the company, Mr.  B. Evans, stressed that the fire was  contained to the yard area and   exaggerated fears  were due to the  confusion at the start of the fire,  many people believing bombs had  gone off in the city.   The security and fire regulations  of the port area are such that an area  where the trouble starts can be easily  isolated, as happened in this case,  he  said.  The damage was very small in  relation to the whole area.   inhuman conditions of these evil  places.  Hundreds of Irish men and women  are being held and many others are  being held under savage sentences in  the hands of these gaolers.  The fight for freedom and  sovereignty is being waged by the  wonderful men and women of this  generation. We pledge our support  and ask all concerned to join us in  this noble cause.  The struggle has been long and  arduous and the cost in human  suffering great but our goal is a free  and united Ireland.  We call on all elected officers and  all Civil Rights organizations to  express their involvement and deep  concern to the United Nations.  Failure to condemn would leave the  British free to continue the same  barbarous treatment of Irish  Republican prisoners in a savage  effort to break the spirits of the  prisoners and their loved ones.

Antrim, settled  in an American frontier  log-cabin and began  farming. Within two years  he died, and three days  after his death Andrew  was born. Mrs. Jackson  with her three children  moved in with a  neighbouring family, and  by the time he was nine  Andrew had progressed  enough at his schooling to  be selected to read the  newly-adopted Declaration  of Independence to his  assembled neighbours.  When only 14 the  future President, already a  member of the local  militia, was captured by a  British raiding party. A  British officer ordered him  to clean his boots and  when the young  Irish-American refused, he  was brutally cut across the  face with a slash of the  officer's sword. The hand  which Jackson threw up to  save himself was cut to the  bone and for the rest of  his life he carried the scars.  For the rest of his life,  too, he carried an aversion  to Britain.  The proud independence which was part of his  character as a boy  remained with Jackson as  a man. Slow to forget  either a good turn or an  injury, he did not forgive  what he considered an  intrigue against him by  Henry Clay during the  early part of his political  career. When he won the  Presidency, then, for the  second time on November  7, 1832, the fact that Clay  was his defeated opponent  made his victory all the  sweeter.  dumping, were putting off thousands  of visitors to Ireland and stopping  others from coming again.  He said that Ireland was lucky it  did not have dramatic outbreaks of  disease like other countries and said  the only solution to the problem,  which was a community one, was a  major national drive to create  awareness of the problem and combat  it.  The seminar, organised by the  Western Health Board and which was  attended by hoteliers, guesthouse  owners and caterers, was told that  little if any progress had been made in  the critical areas of hygiene.  Said    Mr.    Gorman:    'There   is  evidence to indicate that low hygiene  standards are a major barrier to the  fullest development of our tourism.  In terms of lost 'word of mouth'    business our dirt may be losing us    tens of thousands of tourists each     year.    Bord Failte is involved in hotel  hygiene in a very basic way. We claim  that all approved hotels are clean and  comfortable. By so doing we commit  ourselves to hygiene standards, not  only in those parts of the hotel seen  by the tourist, but also in the staff J  areas.

The price paid both in the long and  short term in tourism in cases like  these far exceeds the cost of adequate  preventative measures.   That we in Ireland have not had  such dramatic instances in no way  reflects our attitudes to hygiene. It  can be put down to a combination of  luck and a climate which does not  always provide the best conditions for  the spread of bacteria.   In those months when resorts  carry many times their normal winter  population and water runs low in the  reservoirs, we may often be on the  edge of an outbreak of major  proportions,  Mr. Gorman said.

        <pagetext>nr   It is not those who inflict the most but those who endure the most who will succeed.  Terence MacSwiney.  6        '       MEN BE  THE WIRE  The positive quality of the true revolutionary is that he is ready to die, not to defend   an ideal but rather to convert it into a reality.'  Sean Meehan Re-Arrested  Outside Portlaiose Jail  Justice McGrath at Portarlington  court granted an application for the  extradition of Sean Meehan (22), of  Crumlin Road, Belfast.  The Justice informed Meehan that  the warrant would not be issued for  15 days. In the meantime, Meehan  was granted bail in his own surety of    1,000 and one surety from William  Fuller, Howth Road, Dublin, of    5,000.  Meehan is wanted in Belfast in  connection with the murder of  Constable Raymond Carroll on  January 28, 1972. It is understood  that three other men are already  serving sentences in connection with  the same charge.  Det.-Sgt. Philip O'Keeffe,  Portlaoise, told  the  court  that  he  arrested Meehan on foot of a warrant  outside Portlaoise Jail on Saturday  morning last. When charged later at a  special court, Meehan replied:   Nothing to say.   Witness told Mr. Myles Shevlin,  solicitor, defending, that he could not  actually identify Meehan as the man  wanted in Belfast.  Det.-Constable Bert Elliott, R.U.C,  Belfast, said he identified Meehan as  the man wanted in connection with  the murder.  Mr. Myles Shevlin submitted that  the warrant as issued was not good. It  did not name any discernable person.  It mentioned a police constable only.  There could be any number of  constables.  London Catholic Institute's  Evidence Slams Internment  The London-based Catholic  Institute for International Relations,  whose President is Cardinal Heenan,  has come out strongly against  internment.  The Institute's criticisms are  contained in a 2,000 word  memorandum it has submitted to the  Gardiner Committee which is  currently looking into the workings  of the Northern Ireland Emergency  Provisions Act. Members of the  Institute also gave evidence to the  Committee in Belfast last week.  The CHR evidence calls for a date  to be set when all internees must  either be released or formally charged  with a specific offence before the  Northern Ireland courts. This, the  evidence says,  is the only feasible  policy... and there is no room for  half measures.   Opposition to internment, the  memorandum says, derives among  both the Catholic and Protestant  communities in the North from the  basic injustice of the system.  The document attacks specifically  the workings of the Emergency  Provisions Act, its  derogation from  accepted British standards of justice   and the demoralising effect of  internment on individuals, families  and the community in Northern  Ireland.   There is no doubt,  the evidence  says,  that the introduction in August  1971 of internment without trial  greatly accelerated the trend towards  violence and alienated almost the  entire Catholic community.   The CUR urges the need  to  restore respect for the rule of law  in  the North, but adds that there can be  no hope of introducing any civil  police force into many areas while  internment lasts.  The authors of the CUR evidence  acknowledge the help of among  others the Rev. Enda McDonagh,  Professor of Moral Theology at  Maynooth, Fr. Desmond Wilson of  Belfast and Professor Hywell Griffiths  of the New University of Ulster, in  preparing their memorandum.  BBC Sit-In By Loyalist Women  Programmes by BBC Northern  Ireland were not disrupted last week  despite a sit-in by up to 100 relatives  and friends of loyalist prisoners at  Long Kesh who were demanding  better conditions for their men. They  refused to allow staff in or out and  threatened to call in UDA men unless  they were allowed to continue their  protest peacefully.  The women sat in the lobby of the  Ormeau Avenue studios and some  wandered around talking to staff but  the general tone of the occupation  was good-humoured.  Northern Ireland head of  programmes, Mr. Richard Francis,  said that while he could not condone  an invasion of private property in this  manner, the protest had not  , interfered with the preparation or  transmission of programmes.  The occupation began shortly after  10 a.m. when about 30 women, led  by Mrs. Mary Douglas, burst through  the doors past the security men. They  were later joined by other women  who were coming back from visits to  Long Kesh. Cigarettes and food were  banded in through windows and  loyalist flags were flown to highlight  their protest.  We decided to occupy  the BBC to get the maximum  publicity for our protest against the  inhuman conditions being suffered by  our men in Long Kesh, even though  they had nothing to do with the  burning of the camp by the  republicans,  said one of the women.  During the day they allowed  members of the BBC Northern  Ireland Orchestra to leave after a  rehearsal, but movement in and out  of Broadcasting House was severely  restricted and at the whim of the  protesters. The women were later  joined by loyalist councillor, Mr.  Hugh Smith.  Persecution And Principle  It is with reluctance we refer to the part played by the  Irish Hierarchy in the tragic happenings of 1922-23, but  history is history and the truth, however bitter, must be  told. We wish with all our heart that the story could have  been otherwise, that we could tell with pride of spiritual  guides who were at one with the most loyal and devoted of  their flock in their desire and their efforts for freedom, as  Cardinal Mercier and the Bishops and priests of Belgium  were with their people when the horrors of invasion and  war swept down on them in 1914. Instead of hailing the  invader as the legitimate ruler of Belgium and his native  tools as patriots, Cardinal Mercier encouraged his people to  the utmost resistance they could give and lashed with  words of fire those slavish Belgians who yielded to the  invader, co-operated with him in any way or recognised  him as having the slightest authority or right in Belgium  then or in the future. The noble words with which he  inspired his own countrymen gave inspiration to the men  of 1916, of 1920 and of 1922 in Ireland, when they stood  up against the arrogant attacks of England and of  England's Irish tools and gave their clean lives for the  God-given freedom and honour of Ireland.   I was asked lately by a staff officer/' said Cardinal  Mercier,  whether a soldier falling in a righteous  cause-and our cause is such a demonstration-is not  veritably a martyr. Well, he is not a martyr in the rigorous  theological meaning of the word, inasmuch as he dies in  arms, whereas the martyr delivers himself, undefended and  unarmed, into the hands of the executioner. But if I am  asked what I think of the eternal salvation of a brave man  who has consciously given his life in defence of his  country's honour, and in vindication of violated justice, I  shall not hesitate to reply, without any doubt whatever,  Christ crowns his military valour, and that death, accepted  in this Christian spirit, assures the safety of that man's  soul.  Greater love than this no man hath,' said Our  Saviour, 'that a man lay down his life for his friends.' And  the soldier who dies to save his brothers and to defend the  hearths and altars of his country, reaches this highest of all  degrees of Charity.   When the soldiers of the Republic of Ireland were  fighting 'to defend the hearths and altars of their country'  against England's Black-and-Tans they were excom  municated by at least one Irish Bishop and denounced by  several others. When 93 per cent of the people declared by  their votes that Dail Eireann and the I.R.A. were the  lawful Government and Army of Ireland   the most unanimous vote that has ever been given in the face of armed  intimidation in any country on earth-the Irish Hierarchy  were respectfully asked to crown their people's choice by  giving their allegiance to Dail Eireann and so stregthen the  hands of those who were trying to make real and lasting  peace with England. They refused, and by their refusal  forfeited their right to take part in the political affairs of  their country in the future. But when the Treaty of  Surrender was signed and its terms prematurely published  by the English and their Irish allies, and before the elected  representatives of the people had time to meet and discuss  what had been done without authority, some of the  Bishops rushed into print to urge its acceptance and  commenced privately to urge deputies of Dail Eireann to  vote for it. They went further. They entered into the  strangest Alliance that has ever been known in Ireland. The  Fenians, or Irish Republican Brotherhood, a great end  splendid military organisation, founded in 1858, became  such a menance to British Imperialism that a clever and  subtle campaign of English lying and misrepresentation  succeeded in having it condemned by Rome as a secret  society on the lines of the Freemasons or the  Oddfellows-which it was not. From the Sixties down to  our own day the I.R.B. was condemned year by year in  Lenten Pastorals and the young men warned against it. The  I.R.B., re-organised and made a very compact, effective  organisation by Clarke, MacDiarmada, Pearse and MacBride was the spark that lit the Easter Fire of 1916.  Afterwards, when the I.R.A. gave allegiance to Dail  Eireann, an effort was made by Cathal Brugha and others  to have the I.R.B. disbanded, as there was no further  necessity for and a great deal of danger in a secret  organisation; but Michael Collins and his friends kept it in  being and, after the truce, tried to get into it every  member of the I.R.A., the reason given being  to safeguard  the Republic as there was danger of the politicians letting  it down.  It was the I.R.B. prostituted to political ends,  that undermined the loyalty of high Army officers and  soldier deputies of Dail Eireann in December, 1921, and it  was an alliance or comgination of the Irish Hierarchy and  the I.R.B. that carried the Treaty of Surrender. There is no  doubt whatever about that.  When the Provisional Government was set up by men  who had publicly stated that they would be loyal to their  solemn oath and would keep intact the Republic of  Ireland, the Bishops smiled on it and frowned on its  opponents. In October, 1922, after war had been started  by the usurpers, under orders from England, after the Pact  of Peace had been broken by them, and after they had  already murdered Republicans, The Bishops issued what  they called a  Joint Pastoral  in which they gave their  whole-hearted support to those who had betrayed their  trust and murdered their kin, and they forbade their  priests to give Absolution to the defenders of the Republic  or to any of their supporters, all of whom were denounced  in most intemperate language. There was condemnation in  the  Joint Pastoral  of what were called  unauthorised  murders,  but when the implication of those ill-chosen  words was seen, they were repudiated by their authors.  But it was too late. Such thoroughly British organs as The  Freeman's Journal, and The Tablet (London) had already  published the version containing the extraordinary words,  and their copies of the Pastoral had been handed to them  by the Secretary to the Hierarchy, himself a Bishop. After  that, no penitent known to be a Republican who had not  turned traitor to Ireland, was given Absolution unless he  answered in the affirmative the question;  Do you accept  the Joint Pastoral?  Prisoners were in a terrible position.  There were over 10,000 men and women, boys and girls, in  the British jails and internment camps of the 26 Counties.  They had been arrested and held without charge of any  kind-simply because they were Republicans-and the bare  fact that they were prisoners put upon them the ban of the  Bishops. The chaplains could not give them the Sacraments  unless they accepted the Pastoral, they could not accept  the Pastoral without accepting as truth the falsehood that  the Provisional Government of usurpers and rebels was a  Government elected by the votes of the people, without  accepting treachery and murder as virtues and fidelity and  sacrifice as crimes, and so men and women the mcst  devoted and loyal to their Faith in Ireland were left  without the strength and consolation of Confession and  Holy Communion.  Superiors of Religious Orders were reprimanded by  individual Bishops for sending confessors to Columns of  Republican soldiers in the hills.' Republican priests or nuns  could not express their opinions, even in the privacy of  communities, while those who supported the  Free  Stater,  even in battle, was murder. The I.R.B. was  honoured; those who had tried to have that secret society  disbanded and to have only open organisations were  treated as men accursed. Michael Collins was the leading  man in the I.R.B. When he was killed in battle, he was  given honours scarcely less than would have been given to  a Cardinal. There was no protest when a prominent I.R.B.  man stood up in the midst of Bishops and priests and  likened Michael Collins to Our Lord walking on the waters  of the Lake of Galilee. And only a little while before the  dead body of Cathal Brugha-one of the most exemplary  Catholics in Ireland-was refused admission to a Dublin  Church. It was said at the time that the slaughter of the  Four Martyrs on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception  in 1922 was delayed for over an hour in the hope that they  would accept the  Joint Pastoral  as just, and the  Government of traitors as the lawful authority. For that  official murder of innocent men no word of condemnation  came from the Bishops. Over two hundred  authorised   and  unauthorised murders  were committed by the  renegades in power, but they were hailed by the Bishops as  the saviours of their country, while their clean-hearted  victims who died the death of martyrs were denounced as  robbers, looters and hooligans who were not worthy of  Christian burial. Priests who came out into the open as  Republicans were victimised. Some were driven into exile,  like Father Albert, Father Dominic, Father Joseph and  Father Ciaran, while others who could not stand by and  see the injustice of it all and the danger to the Faith which  it threatened, had to express themselves anonymously and  do good by stealth. Their candid opinions of the  Joint  Pastoral., and the attitude it represented could be quoted  here, but they would be of little use because no names  could be appended to them.  Three RTE Chiefs May Face  Charges Of Publicising IRA  Three leading RTE programme  makers could soon face charges of  breaking a Government directive  banning all TV publicity for the IRA.  In a new move, the RTE Authority  is to decide shortly whether or not  the controversial  7-Days   programme on internment-screened  nearly three weeks ago-breached the  Section 31 guidelines laid down more  than two years ago.  The RTE Board has now taken a  direct interest in the programme  which drew a personal protest from  the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs,  and its nine members have demanded  a full file on the show which led to  management action inside the station.  Transferred producer Eoghan  Harris and his editor, Gerry Murray,  hit by the results of an inquiry into  the programme, appealed the  management moves during a  four-hour hearing on Saturday but  now both men and their direct  superior, Current Affairs Chief, Des  Fisher, may have to face the  Authority directly to explain the  show.  The results of the appeal heard by  Authority member, Mr. Sean  MacReamoinn; Personnel Head,  Oliver Maloney, and Assistant  Programme Controller, Mr. Jack  White, are expected to be made  known today but the appeal decision  Hunger Strike At  Crumlin Rd. Jail  Republican remand prisoners in  Crumlin Road Jail-some of whom  have been waiting for trial for up to a  year-a hunger strike began November  7 in protest against being locked up in  their cells for 22 out of every 24  hours.  The strike was undertaken initially  by 30 prisoners, and more will join in  the next few days until all 165 men in  a wing are involved.  During the strike the men are  understood to intend refusing food  parcels.  Sentenced prisoners are expected  to refuse to leave their cells in  support of their demands for a return  to normality at the prison.  The latest trouble at the prison has  its origins in the burning of Long  Kesh three weeks ago.  Prisoners at Crumlin Road  demonstrated in support and the  remand prisoners feel that they have  been excessively penalised since then.  The remand prisoners-who are  innocent until proven guilty in the  court-are normally allowed  . considerable access to recreation  facilities and free association with  each other.  But up to now, recreation breaks  were being confined to two hours per  day for three batches of 55 men each,  and they claim that the Governor of  the prison told them that this  situation would continue indefinitely.   The men find this situation  intolerable and are determined to  highlight their grievances, particularly  since there has been absolutely no  trouble for the past three weeks.  may be held in abeyance until the  Authority has finished its look at the  show.  If the Board decides that the  programme breached the Section 31  directive, Mr. Harris, Mr. Murray and  Mr. Fisher could face more serious  charges.  The Authority is understood to be  intent on discharging its obligations  under the directive and its members  are not prepared to risk the  possibility of being sacked, the fate  which met the station Authority  when it failed to reach a decision over  a radio interview with Sean  MacStiophain two years ago.  RTE Administrators are also  becoming worried about new  consumer programmes, according to a  document submitted by the station to  the Common Market Commission and  published in the current edition of  the EEC  Industry and Society.   The latest dispute within RTE over  the showing of a  7-Days   programme on internment is certain  to be raised in the Dail later this  week, Chris Glennon writes.  Two questions to the Minister, Dr.  Cruise O'Brien, will provide a vehicle  for examining his role in relation to  RTE programmes, particularly the  October 17 film on internment.  Mr. Tom Meaney, F.F. deputy,  mid-Cork, will ask the Minister the  number of occasions on which he has  requested time on radio or TV to  explain his viewpoint and how many  times the Minister has  verbally or in  writing contacted the RTE authorities  to communicate his displeasure with  certain programmes.   Those questions are not expected  to be reached until later. The  Taoiseach will be asked by Mr. Sean  Moore (F.F.) if there are any  proposals before the Government to  amend the Constitution or to prepare  a new Constitution.     Torture On Trial  Four Northern Ireland men who  were tortured at the hands of the  British Army and the R.U.C. Special  Branch left Dublin Airport this week  accompanied by their lawyers to  attend the  Torture  case against the  British Government at the European  Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  The case will continue until next  Thursday and a team of four doctors  as well as Mr. John Hume of the  S.D.L.P. and delegates from the  Republic are attending. However,  three of the seven men are in Long  Kesh and last minute efforts by their  lawyers, and an appeal by them to the  European Commission, failed to  secure their release for the Court  hearings.  The British Government has  insisted that they will not be released  and has refused the Commissioners  access to Long Kesh to take  statements from the three. Two of  the men have been interned for  almost a year and the other is a  sentenced prisoner, but friends have  requested that their names be  withheld for the present because of  fears for the safety of other members  of their families.

        <pagetext>CM  HI  -J  a.  O  The Hunger Strikers  At Foly Square  I   2  x  CO  .2  E   gt;  o  2  By: BERNARD MACKLE  Last August, I bumped into Jimmy  Lyons, an old friend, on O'Connell  Street, Dublin, while on a visit to  Ireland.  Jimmy, a disabled vet, served in my  old army division (27th Infantry Reg.  25th Div.). He owns a tavern in  Hillside, N.J., called  Lyons' Den .  Jim a native of County Roscommon,  Ireland, has a lovely American wife  Eileen and five children.  We arranged to take the train from  Dublin to Belfast and see for  ourselves whether the British army  was really keeping peace between  Irish religious fanatics, as reported in  most Jersey papers.  We stayed only two days in Belfast,  which seemed afterwards like two  weeks, and were left with the  unforgettable memory of the Irish  people in Belfast who silently resist  the constant ominous threat of the  occupying British army. On the  evening of the day we arrived, a 13  year old child went to the corner  store to get an ice cream cone and  was shot dead by one of the  pasty-faced soldiers in flack jackets of  the Royal Green Jacket Regiment  who patrol the streets of Belfast in  daylight on foot or in heavy armored  cars with their finger always in the  trigger guard of an automatic  shoulder weapon.  We stayed in separate houses that  night.  Lyons woke up in a bedroom  flooded with blinding white light and  deafened by the sound of a helicopter  hovering directly over the house. The  search lights are used by the  helicopter pilots to illuminate the  backyards ot Nationalist areas looking  for a target for the door gunner. It is  at night that the I.R.A. lads  on the  run  are trying to get home for a visit  with their mother and family. Most of  the fathers are interned in the  infamous Long Kesh Concentration  Camp.  Not a word of bigotry or religious  hatred did we hear while there, but  many accounts of the vicious  ruthlessness of the hated  Brits  and  the courageous exploits of the I.R.A.  lads were related in the tiny kitchens  and parlors.  We left convinced that peace will  never come to the six counties of  occupied Ireland until the United  Nations intervene and the British  Army with tho S.A.S. assassination  experts are withdrawn from Ireland.  The S.A.S. (Secret Air Services)  resemblos the C.I.A. in that it uses the  same tactics of clandestine murder,  infiltration, and the distorted news  release to discredit the Irish men who  are fighting to free their native land  from the ancient enemy.  I left Jimmy in Dublin to go to the  musical festival in Listowel, County  Kerry, where the traditional Irish  Musicians Club of N.Y., the group I  travelled with on the charter air trip,  would be competing in the annual  events. Jimmy went on to the North  to visit Derry City, scene of  Bloody  Sunday  when British soldiers in  dress uniform pulled into a small  square, dismounted from their  armored cars and carefully aiming at  short range, fired into the backs of a  group of Irish people listening to a  civil rights speaker on a stand. 13  persons were left dead. The shocking  crime was given world wide publicity  since a news photographer was in the  square. Nonetheless, no charges were  ever brought by the English  Government against their uniformed  murderers.  When Jimmy arrived back in  Hillside, he was selected as President  of the NJ. Chapter of the Irish Legal  Aid Fund. This fund was formed to  provide  25 per week to support each  of the children of the four  Irish-Americans who had been  arrested in New York by the F.B.I.,  tried in Baltimore, convicted and  sentenced to six years and then sent  separately to maximum security  prisons to be kept in solitary  confinement for admitting guilt to  Sinn Fein President  Addresses All-Group Conference  South's Government  ise To Attend  the Federal Crime of attempting to  arrange, in New York, the purchase of  arms for the I.R.A.  In the Baltimore Federal Court,  Judge Northrup, before sentencing, to  his credit, said, the defendants were  not true criminals and acted out of  love for their native land.  One of the prisoners, Jim Conlon, a  Queens, N.Y. businessman with a  large family, has, in recent weeks,  been subjected to intense  interrogation by Federal Agents in his  cell in the Ft. Leavenworth Bastile,  although his lawyer had not been  notified. When Conlon refused to  become an  informer , he was  threatened with deportation to  Belfast, his native city.  One of two things can happen to  Jim when the plane touches down in  Belfast. Either he will be placed under  surveillance and murdered sometime  later by S.A.S. agents or else arrested  and taken by helicopter to Long Kesh  where he will undergo torture and  intensive interrogation while his wife  and 5 children pray for his safety  back home in New York.  It should be noted that a former  I.R.A. Chief, Sean McBride, winner of  the Nobel Peace Prize earlier in the  month, headed Amnesty  International, the organization that  brought documented charges of  torture of prisoners in the Long Kesh  Concentration Camp, against the  British Government at the hearings  held before the European  Commission of Human Rights in  Strasbourg. The hearings, which  revealed the shocking atrocities by  British guards, have been moved to  Stavenger, Norway.  Since the recent fire in Long Kesh  that destroyed most of the miserable,  overcrowded huts, the Irish internees,  held without charge or trial, are now  forced to sleep out on the wet ground  and have the indignities of their  personal items being destroyed by the  British guards.  Bishop Drury of Corpus Christi,  Texas, and New York Congressman  Wolf, who actually have been inside  Long Kesh, say the only items missing  there are the gas ovens.  Monday, October 28th at 9:00  P.M., James Lyons and Michael  Costeloe, a County Galway man and  father of 4 children, began a hunger  strike on the steps of the Federal  Building in Foley Square, New York  City, hoping somehow to stop the  threat of deportation of Conlon to  Long Kesh, to effect a transfer to a  prison closer to his home so his  children could visit, and to stop any  further questioning without the  presence of his attorney.  On Wednesday, the third day of  the hunger strike, T.V. camera crews  interviewed Lyons and Costeloe on  the steps while a New Jersey  Delegation of Irish-Americans from  Bergen, Ocean, Monmouth, and Essex  Counties sang Irish songs.  On Saturday, November 2nd, the  sixth day without food, Lyons and  Costeloe were again applauded by  their friends. Mrs. Conlon arrived,  showing the visible effects of the fear  of her husband's deportation threat  and thanked both men for their  sacrifice on her husband's behalf.  Jim Conlon's six-year old boy then  spoke into the Mike and faltering,  thanked both the hunger strikers for  trying to bring his daddy back home.  Tears were streaming unashamedly  down many faces at this time.  Speakers then asked everyone to  write to their Representatives to  intervene so the hunger strike could  end since Lyons and Costeloe were  resolved to continue until a  substantial committment was given.  Many telegrams were read,  including those from Congressman  Carey, from Ramsey Clark who  promised to join their legal staff, and  Fr. Sean McManus, the Baltimore  priest who has done so much in the  crusade to bring justice to Northern  Ireland.  The following telegram was  received*  MY  WASHINGTON   OFFICE  IS  Refui  Michael Costello and Jim Lyons  CONTACTING DIRECTOR  BUREAU OF PRISONS TO SEEK  TRANSFER OF J. CONLON FROM  LEAVENWORTH TO  LEWISBURG-EVERYTHING  POSSIBLE WILL BE DONE TO  BRING CONLON CLOSER TO HIS  FAMILY.  CONGRESSMAN PETER W.  RODINO,JR.  On Saturday night, Congressman  Rodino met Mrs. Conlon in Newark  and gave her his personal assurance  that every effort would be made to  halt the threatened deportation of her  husband.  Word was brought to Jim Lyons  and Mike Costeloe on the steps at  Foley Square and they agreed to halt  the hunger strike.  All of us who know both men can  only express our admiration for their  courage and selfless sacrifice but the  gratitude of Mrs. Conlon and her little  family will always sustain them.  On Monday afternoon, November  4th, Bart Dougherty, a Detective Lt.  in the Essex County Prosecutors  Office and the National Coordinator  of the Irish Legal Aid Fund received a  telephone call from Congressman  Rodino. He informed Dougherty that  the Director of Federal Prisons had  just notified the Congressman that  James Conlon was being transferred  to Lewisburg, Md.

Almost every  speaker from the platform and the  floor condemned the absence of the  representatives during the three-day  Conference.  The conference, organised by the  Speakers' Club of the Regional  Technical College, Galway, was  described as a vehicle whereby  Irishmen of all political opinions,  North and South, could give their  answers to current crisis. But despite  the absence of the government or  Opposition of the South a  representative panel of about 50  speakers from North and South  including many Republican and  Loyalist contingents took part in the  debate. The subject for discussion was   Can Irishmen Find A Solution To  Their Own Problems . All the  sessions, especially the private ones,  involving loyalist leaders, the  Provisionals and many shades of  opinion, provided signs of a large  extent of common ground. The  delegates taking part were unanimous  in a wish to meet again soon.  THE BUILDING OF  A NEW IRELAND  The President of Provisional Sinn  Fein, Mr. Ruairi O'Bradaigh told the  conference that once the British made  an undertaking to withdraw from  Northern Ireland the I.R.A. would  stop fighting. Said Mr. O'Bradaigh:   When we come to the matter of a  solution the key to the solution lies in  a declaration by the British of their  intention, over some period of years,  to be negotiated, to quit our country  once and for all.  'That should be the first step and  the I.R.A. have said in their public  statement that once such a date is  given and a firm intention, they  would stop fighting.  and a fresh start made .  Mr. O'Bradaigh quoted the British  Kilbrandon Report where, he said, a  federal system was defined as  sovereignty divided between two  levels of government, the federal  government sovereign in some matters  and the provincial in others, each  exercising power within its own  sphere and neither subordinate.  Mr. O'Bradaigh added that the  situation in Ireland now was the  result of the failure of an imposed  British settlement in 1921.  MR. HARRY MURRAY, formerly  of the Loyalist Ulster Workers  Council, said that he believed the  people of the North must first be  united before there could be an  united Ireland.  We must live  together  he said.  We must be one  people. Before the constitutional  convention elections, there must be  dialogue established by both sides in  the North so that they could remove  their fears and suspicion of each  other .  MR. SAMMY SMITH, a member of  the Ulster Defence Association told  the conference:  It is obvious that  their position (Irish Nationalists) is  one of sheer, undiluted nationalist  bigotry. It must be emphasised that I  am referring to the citizens of the  Republic and Northern Nationalists  who, to a man subscribe to the myth  of a united Ireland. The Protestant in  Northern Ireland is not Irish, does not  regard himself as Irish and objects  most vehemently when * he is allied  with what, to him, is now a most  obnoxious breed .  MR. FRANK McMANUS, the  former U n ity M.P. for  Fermanagh/South Tyrone said that if  the Loyalists had not destroyed  Sunningdale, the Nationalists would  have done so, since it sought to  formalise the artificial division of the  community. The forthcoming  Convention should, as a first step,  negotiate   English  withdrawal from   The next stage, I would see, is the   tne  North, and lf tnis Convention  building of a new federal Ireland with  a division of power-both states,  North and South, being dismantled  created a forum for  listening    point   worthwhile .  a representative  it    would    be  Loyalists Will Be Worst  Hit By Currency  The Ulster Workers' Council plan  to boycott Irish cash was seen in  Dublin on Monday as a very damp  squib likely to cause more  inconvenience to Loyalists than to  any other section of the Northern  Ireland community.  The UWC scheme is to put up  posters in shops telling customers that  Irish money will not be accepted.  Council spokesman, Mr. Jan Smyth,  said that in a'ddition, factory workers  would be asked not to accept the  Republic's currency in pay packets.  But an Irish banks'spokesman said  the campaign would have no major  practical effect. And the Dublin  Government is understood to feel  that anything which forms an  unnecessary barrier between North  and South, or between communities  in the North is something to be  deplored.  GOODS SANCTIONS  '   LATER  Mr. Smyth said that  sanctions on  Eire goods  would be considered  later. The UWC had decided that in  view of their opposition to a united  Ireland  It was ridiculous that Eire  currency should be used alongside  British currency. Their currency is  not legal tender in the United  Kingdom and, as we are part of the  United Kingdom, it should not be  considered here.   The boycott of currency,  he  added,  will be a means of reminding  the South that we do not want  anything to do with them. Immediate  moves must be made to ensure that  Southern currency is made worthless  in the Six Counties.   Supporting the campaign, the  UWC's Co. Antrim Executive said:   This is no futile protest. It will  permit Ulster folk who are sick and  tired of constant foreign political  intrusion into our tragic situation to  strike a peaceful but humiliating blow  to those same subversive Eire  Government forces.   BANK SPOKESMAN'S  VIEW  The total value of Irish currency in  circulation at present is   22572  million, including   210 million in  notes. Only a small amount of this,  possibly as little as two per cent, is in  circulation in Northern Ireland.  The Irish banks' spokesman said  the boycott would not result in any  exchange rate discrepancy. The banks  all of which are 32-county  organisations, would simply continue  to transfer their respective currencies.   Any bank will accept Irish money  and change it for British money  without any difficulty,  said the  spokesman.  That's just part of their  business. So even if there was a  massive boycott, traders and other  individuals would have no trouble  about getting change.   A Dublin export consultant said a  products boycott would have a  minimal effect on the Republic's  exports to Northern Ireland-now  running at more than   80 million a  year. A retaliatory boycott would  damage the North's economy.  In a  trade war both sides get hurt,  he  said.  The consultant also pointed out  that most business transactions were  done by cheque, bill of exchange or  transfer or funds, and not by cash.

        <pagetext>Need Of Homes For Police beared Of Assault       I                f        - *  U   gt; -    l-    r*         -    Ti  F It  Mentally Handicapped  On Catholic Youth  A Mental Handicap Conference in  Dublin at the week-end was told that  almost 3,000 adult handicapped are  accommodated in Irish psychiatric  hospitals.  This occurred, explained the  Parliamentary Secretary to the.  Minister for Health, Mr. Barry,  because of the inadequate provision  of special residential accommodation  for patients, who, having reached  adulthood in special centres for  children, required continuing care in  residential accommodation.  Mr. Barry explained that it has  been the practice to transfer some  mentally handicapped patients to  mental hospitals, but now there is a  growing volume of opinion against  this arrangement.  Both he and the Minister, he  admitted, felt strongly that  psychiatric hospitals were not the  best setting for mentally  handicapped, and their aim was to  ensure that as soon as sufficient  alternative accommodation was  available no handicapped patient  would be transferred to a psychiatric  hospital, unless he was suffering from  some illness which would warrant  psychiatric treatment.  Moreover, Mr. Barry explained that  the lack of alternative suitable  accommodation' for adults had  resulted in yet another problem the  inordinately high proportion of the  present population in centres who are  16 years and upwards. The latest  available figures shows there are no  less than 2,117 or 44 per-cent of the  patient population in those centres  are adults.  Mr. Barry stressed that one of the  main difficulties in planning for the  future is that there no reliable  statistics available on the numbers of  mentally handicapped children and  adults in the country.  If we are to  plan with confidence we must have  firm facts on which to base our  plans,  he said.  With this in mind, he added, steps  had been taken to secure exact  information about the incidence and  pattern of mental handicap in this  country.  PROTECTION  In a talk on  Community  Involvement  by the Mentally  Handicapped, Mr. Seamus Kelly, of  Dunore House Association, said that  over protection can do as much harm  as neglect, but in the case of adult  handicapped, there must always be  some  degree of protection or care  depending on the degree of handicap  and the type of centre in which the  person lived.  Parents and relatives can help, he  added, by maintaining regular contact  with handicapped people in  residential centres and such contacts  should be encouraged by the  provision of facilities for visiting.  To integrate handicapped adults  into the community, Mr. Kelly said  there must be an acceptance by the  other members of the community.  One cannot impose another group  on to a reluctant community. This  can only defeat the purpose of  placing residential centres in  residential areas.  All members of a  community, handicapped or  otherwise have equal rights. It is  necessary to educate the  non-handicapped as to the nature of  the new members in their midst.   PARENTS'ROLE  Dr. Barbara Stokes, Medical  Director of St. Michael's House, told  the conference that the new  ministerial move towards the closer  involvement of parents in the  management of primary schools,  special or otherwise, was of great  interest and they now awaited the  views of the I.N.T.O.  The appointment of parents to sit  on management committee will entail  all parents of a school group getting  together to select the representatives,  which will mean more information to  parents, concerning the costs,  difficulties and anxieties of running a  school.  They might be able to help more  and to understand teachers' and  management problems. This type of  involvement, in the past, might have  advanced both sides, parents and  professional, towards the provision of  full and adequate services for the  adolescent and adult, sooner.  Referring to the social services for  the handicapped, Dr. Stokes said  there was still need for parents to  achieve this through their local  associations via the National  Association. She advocated that they  should press for the provision of  holiday homes for parents and  children together, for social clubs, for  hostel accommodation, for a geriatric  home and for more residential  accommodation.  She told delegates that if they  wished for more, better, or future  services that it was their responsibility  to take an active, interested part in  the activities of the individual  member societies to which they  belonged.  Three members of the RUC Special  Patrol Group were cleared at Armagh  Court of beating up a 19-year-old  Catholic factory worker after they  had detained him for questioning by  detectives as he left work earlier this  year.  Constables Arthur Miskelly (20),  Oliver Weir (23) and Jackie Boyd  (21), had denied assaulting Anthony  James Quigley, Cailan St., Armagh,  on May 1.  As Quigley and a young woman  companion left the courthouse after  the hearing, both were taken into  custody by uniformed police and  driven in a Land-Rover to RUC  Headquarters, Armagh, for interview  in connection with other matters.  In the witness-box, Quigley alleged  that he was ill-treated in a police car  and questioned as to what he knew  about the Provisional IRA. He told of  being driven to a quiet country lane  and claimed that he was ordered out  of the car and told to get down on his  knees and pray.  Quigley alleged that when he  refused to kneel, two of the  policemen started to punch and kick  him. When he tried to get away, he  was pushed into the hedge. Then he  was put back into the car and driven  to the barracks. He claimed that on  the way there, he was slapped across  the face and on getting out of the car,  Constable Weir hit him in the face.  DOCTOR'S EVIDENCE  Dr. Stephen Garvin gave evidence  of examining Quigley and finding a  bruise on the scalp above the left ear.  There was slight bleeding from a  scratch on the lobe of his ear and  from the lower lip. A slight swelling  was visible over the left cheek bone  and Quigley had scratches and bruises  on the left thigh and right knee.  All three police officers denied in  the witness box that they had  assaulted Quigley. Constable Miskelly  said the youth was bundled into the  car, but this was because of a previous  escape from police, the fact that he  was struggling and that an aggressive  crowd was gathering.  .Witness said he decided to return  to the police station via Mullinure  Lane because workers were getting  out of two factories and it was  not a  healthy area for the police.  At rush  hour there were traffic jams in  Railway Street which was another  particularly bad area for the police.  The constable admitted that there  were no marks on Quigley when he  got into the police car. He could not  say where the youth had got the  injuries.   I know Quigley has no love for  the police  said the constable. He  suggested, under cross-examination,  that the youth would be prepared to  take a hammering to  get back at the  R.U.C.   Q)  in  CD  CO  I.  m  X  -o  m  O  -v  r-  m  z  o   lt;  CD  3  w  CD  o  53  PUBS TO CLOSE ON SUNDAY'S  Dublin pubs may be closed on  Sundays, and barmen threatened that  their Sunday work ban could escalate  to an all-out strike.  The  dry Sunday  decision was  taken at a meeting in the city of  1,500 barmen. They want a five-day,  40-hour, Monday-to-Saturday week  with overtime on Sundays.  The decision comes after months  of negotiations between barmen and  bosses. General Secretary of the  barmen's union, the Irish National  Union of Vintners, Grocers and Allied  Trades Assistants, Mr. Michael Cleary,  warned:  If the Sunday ban does not  work we will take full strike action.   LABOUR COURT  The barmen's claim for a  Monday-to-Saturday week went to  the Labour Court some time ago. But  the Court suggested that the barmen  go back to the discussion table with  the bosses, the Licensed Vintners'  Association.  Mr. Cleary said yesterday that the  discussions had fallen through. The  barmen were offered pay rises in the  supervisory and apprentice classes if  they would agree to a system of  part-time labour, he said. But nothing  was agreed to on the question of a  Monday-to-Saturday week. The offer  was refused.  The  dry Sunday  begins on  November 17, and Mr. Cleary warned  that pubs would not be allowed to  open with non-union labour or with  bosses pulling the pints.   If it is necessary we will place  pickets on pubs that attempt to use  non-union labour. Our work stoppage  on Sundays will mean a complete  shut-down,  he said.  AREAS HIT  He added that barmen would not  refuse to work in any individual pubs  which chose to give them what they  wanted.  Pubs throughout Dublin, and in the  Bray, Wicklow and Dun Laoghaire  areas, will be hit by the strike.  Hospitals' Report  Challenged  Comhairle Na nOspideal report on  the future development of general  hospital services in the Cork city area  was challenged when representatives  of the management and staff of the  Mercy Hospital, Cork, said that the  reasoning behind the idea of a single  hospital  did not bear up under  examination.   A preliminary report by an  independent architect on the future  of the Mercy Hospital, which was  presented at a press conference,  contradicted the comhairle report  that  it was agreed on economic  grounds and in terms of the quality  and range of services which could be  provided   that   a   single   (700-bed)  17,000 In Jail  Because Of Drink  Prisoners whose real problem is  alcoholism should be sent to special  rehabilitation centres, Britain's  Helping Hand Organisation said in a  report published recently.  Over half of Britain's 35,000  prisoners are in jail either directly or  indirectly because of a drinking  problem, the organisation claims.  Keeping them in prison at   40 a  week is costing the country a  staggering   38 million a year.   When they leave, the 17,000 men  involved still have the problem, and  return to prison time and time again.   The report,  Alcoholism and  Crime  says this is a  wasteful  way  of dealing with them.   The current method of dealing  with them is ineffective,  the report  says  Some method other than prison  must be devised.   Rehabilitation centres of the type  run by Helping Hand are cheaper than  prison U28-  30 a week instead of    40 a week for prison),  but they  give the possibility of getting the man  over his problems and keeping him  out of trouble in *he future .  Such ctntr.r :N)uid be encouraged,  the report says. And it is critical of  the failure to set up detoxification  centres.  The report quotes research dating  from 1966 which showed that 56 per  cent of ex-prisoners had a drink  problem, and 89 per cent of these  said that drink played a part in their  last crime.  A welter of statistics are quoted to  show that in the past 20 years beer  consumption has risen 42 per cent,  wine 100 per cent, and spirits 116 per  cent. Spirit and wine drinking have  increased 23 per cent, and 28 per  cent, especially in just the past two  years.  gt;  The number of patients attending  hospitals for alcoholism or alcoholic  psychosis has risen by more than half  in five years, and drinks convictions  rose by a quarter between 1966 and  1972.   There would now seem to be '  enough cumulative evidence of this  link to question whether our  treatment of alcoholics as criminals is  the most humane or even the most  productive.   The   cost   of   helping   a   man  towards treatment and rehabilitation  is far less than the cost of his frequent ,  stays in H.M. Prisons.

The  architect's report said that in the light  of present experience of large  building projects, there appeared to  be very strong grounds for doubting  that large-scale projects do, in fact  lead to an improvement in quality.  'There is increasing conviction  among architects that there is no way  that a satisfactory environment can  be produced in these mammoth  schemes. The individual cannot avoid  feeling lost and helpless when  confronted with a huge building  complex.   It must be accepted that much  ultra-sophisticated equipment and  facilities can be justified only in very  large hospitals. These facilities are  required for only a very small  percentage of patients.   It is considered that the Mercy  Hospital can provide a useful.part of  Cork's hospital services in both the  interim and long term.   Again referring to the comhairle  report, the architect commented:   We feel they should have been asked  what role the hospital, in its present  form, or suitably modified and/or  extended, could play in the overall  hospital services in Cork.  The architect's conclusions are that  the Mercy in its present form, or  preferably extended or modified,  could cater for at least 300 patients,  reducing the size of the hospital  needed on the' north side of the city  to a  more humane  size. Drawings  presented showed how the Mercy  could be extended by over 80,000  square feet.  RECITAL  Continued from Page 9  by   Mozart,  Strauss,   Debussy, and  Ravel.

        <pagetext>   CL  O  LU  CL   c   2  E  LU  x  o  The Persecution  Of Eamon McThomas  Guerilla War News   -  o  2  By FRED BURNS O'BRIEN  In the 1770's in the British  colonies, the American press was  dutifully suppressed by the British  authorities for purporting to publish  ideas on liberty, most of which were  concocted in the mind of Englishman  Thomas Paine, famous for his  phamphlet COMMON SENSE, a  virtue the British never possessed. It  was the persistent American  broadsides perpetuating the ideal of  freedom that sustained the rebel army  in the most trying times. In the  bleakest hours of the fledging  Republic, the populace could depend  on the dissemination of the free word  giving hope courage and bouying  hampered spirits. Britain feared the  power of the written and spoken  word as they do in their colonies  today, and this on a parrallel with  rebel marksmen.  An editor of a newspaper plays a  most crucial role in a struggle for the  realization of self-determination being  the intermediary between military  and civilian groupings, maintaining  the inertia of both. Eamonn Mac  Thomais, editor of AN PHOBLACHT,  the newspaper of Provisional Sinn  Fein in Ireland is a man analagous in  role to Thomas Paine. Mr. Mac  Thomais with limited resources and a  limited staff faithfully produced and  published the weekly periodical,  reporting the events of the struggle  for freedom in both portions of  Ireland.  Approximately two years ago, Mr.  Mac Thomais was arrested by the  Irish Special Branch and charged  under the AMENDMENT TO THE  OFFICERS AGAINST THE STATE  ACT (1972) as belonging to an illegal  organization. There is no legal means  possible of disproving such charge  should one wish to do so, when the  state has prejudged guilt by the very  fact of such suppressive legislation,  the handiwork of an undemocratic  nation and government.  Upon his release, Mr. Mac Thomais  resumed his duties as editor of AN  PHOBLACHT and not be be deterred,  he once again lashed out in editorials  at    the    inequities    in    Ireland  perpetuated in the North by Britain  and in the Free State by the Cosgrave  Administration. The truth of his  statements and the growth of  readership of his newspaper was a  detriment to both governmental  organs working as a team to terminate  the Republican Movement and to  keep Ireland partitioned. Much to the  chagrin of London and Dublin, the  Movement has grown, and at each  turn of oppression more people are  realizing that the Eamonn Mac  Thomais's, the Daithi O'Connail's, the  Maire Drumm's, and the Ruairi  O'Bradaigh's are not only correct in  their purusits, but the only faction  telling the truth to the people. The  truth is such a rare commodity that it  shocks the conscience of an ordinary  citizen upon realization that such a  virtue still exists.  Needless to say, Mr. Mac Thomais  has been re-arrested on the exact  same charge and given another  identical 15 month jail term for  belonging to an illegal organization by  way of possession of incriminating  documents. Simple justice has been  rendered a severe blow by this  incoherent action. Under English  Common Law which the Dublin  Government has adopted as its basis  of law, there is such an entity known  as  Double Jeopardy.  For those  Dublin Ministers in ignorance, this  means bluntly that one cannot be  tried for the same offense twice. This  is precisely what the Free State has  done in the Mac Thomais case.  The credibility of Dublin is suspect  when it flaunts justice so selectively  that it would intentionally perpetrate  such an abrasion of legality in the  realm of double jeopardy. The double  arrest and double encarceration of  Eamonn Mac Thomais is an abuse of  legal process to say the least and an  arbitrary utilization of justice for the  political purpose of the state.This act  of desperation emits an air of doom  for a system fraught with such  depredations to render it inept in the  normal course of things that such  extraordinary debauchery must be  implemented to protect itself from  the truth.   1 ( 11111111111111111111S B11B Q19 B B13161E11  U118111S111111BIE111 f  E11IJ   I MARY'S I      TRAVEL AGENCY    1      43-02 30th AVENUE, ASTORIA, N.YORK 11103       1      AIR-SHIP-BUS TOURS      1  1 CAR RENTAL-HOTELS 1  S     PHONE-212-726-7760   10 a.m. to 6 P.m.  212-335-0281    7P.M.T--  o  m.  The evening sun breaks through the smoke of burning vehicles as rioting broke out afresh on the Falls  Road in Belfast. Across the road is a barricade of barrels from a hi-jacked beer lorry.  BORDER GUN BATTLE  A six-man Provisional-I.R.A. unit  were involved in a gun battle with  British troops manning a checkpoint  along the Armagh-Monaghan border.  A British Army spokesman claimed  that one of the attackers was seen to  fall but this claim was denied by the  Provisionals. In a statement the  Provisionals said that the attack on  the British Army was carried out by  the Provisionals' 2nd Battalion in  North Armagh.  The claim that a  'gunman' was hit was a complete  fabrication by the British Army to'  conceal the fact that they suffered at  least one casualty during the  exchange.   U.D.R. PATROL UNDER  FIRE IN FERMANAGH  A four-man Ulster Defence  Regiment foot patrol came under fire  on the Gortineddan border between  Derrylin and Ballyconnell. The men  were on observation duty when they  heard a noise about 100 yards away  and fired an illumination flare. Two  men, using automatic weapons, fired  60-70 rounds at them. The U.D.R.  patrol returned the fire. No hits were  claimed on either side.  BUSES BURN AS SNIPERS  OPEN FIRE IN DERRY  Bus services to Shantallow were  suspended after a bus was hijacked  and burned near the estate. Three  young men boarded it at Racecourse  Road and after ordering the driver  and passengers off, set fire to the bus.  A crowd of about 50 people danced  around the burning vehicle. At the  same time an Army patrol came  under sniper fire.  SOLDIERS INJURED IN  BOOBY TRAP EXPLOSION  ' A five-man Army patrol was called  to search an unoccupied house after  an anonymous tip off that men had  been seen entering the house the  night before. The house was in the  Meadowbrook Estate in Craigavon,  Co. Armagh. Two of the soldiers were  searching a cupboard in an upstairs  room when a bomb went off injuring  one of them severely about the face  and legs. The second soldier escaped  with minor injuries.  LANDMINE ATTACK     IN CROSSMAGLEN  In Crossmaglen, Co. Armagh an  Army foot patrol narrowly escaped  injury when alandmine exploded on  the Dundalk Road. The bomb  contained about 20 lbs. of explosives  and the Provisional I.R.A. in the area  accepted responsibility.  BLAST BOMBS, GUNFIRE  AND HI-JACKING IN DERRY  An Army foot patrol escaped  unhurt when two blast bombs were  thrown at them in the Creggan area.  Twenty minutes later a number of  shots were fired at another patrol  nearby. Again no one was hurt.  Civilians hijacked a bus and used it to  block Buncrana Road at Racecourse  Road junction.  BOMB ATTACK AND SNIPER  FIRE IN BELFAST  A   blast-bomb   was   thrown   at  Andersonstown poljr* -*    ;p gt;n t*om  outside the high perimeter fence.  Twelve high-velocity shots were fired  at troops from the junction of  Dunmore Street-Clonard Street, an  Army spokesman said. There were no  casualties and the soldiers returned  the fire. An incendiary was found in a  store on the Ballysillan Road after a  small fire caused slight damage.  BRITISH ARMY BOMB  MAIN RAIL LINE IN ERROR  The Belfast-Dublin  Enterprise   rail service shuddered to an  unscheduled stop when halted by an  Army bomb boob. The military  explosives operation which went  slightly wrong started at about 3:00  p.m. on a narrow border road near  Newry. The Army's tactical boffins  reckoned that the road was being  used for the illegal trafficking of  arms. So they ordered it to be  cratered. As the army detonated the  explosives supervised by railway  officials great chunks of border road  rocketed up into the air - and  plunged down on to the railway  track.

CLE. in the South and Northern  Ireland Railways in the North had o  implement a  bussing  service linking  their Dundalk and Portadown train  terminals to get passengers up and  down from Dublin.  PROVISIONALS APOLOGISE  TO LOYALIST INTERNEES  AT LONG KESH  The Ulster Defence Association has  received a letter of apology from the  Provisional I.R.A. commander in  Long Kesh, Dave Morley,  for  inconvenience and suffering  to  U.D.A. men as a result of the recent  fire in Long Kesh.  Morley also makes it clear in the  letter that the Provisionals are  accepting full responsibility for the  damage in the Camp and that they  have made representations to the  Northern Ireland Office In an attempt  to exonerate UDA men from the  destruction at the camp.   I have informed them that your  men were not responsible for the  burning of any huts and so they  should not be denied visits, and that  every effort should be made to ease  your conditions before the conditions  of the Provos  Morley says.  CUSTOMS POST AND  GARAGE BOMBED IN DERRY  A bomb planted by three men, one  of them armed with a pistol,  destroyed a customs caravan at  Buncrana Road. Staff had been  ordered out and no one was hurt.  About the same time three other  men* one armed, left a bomb at the  patrol pumps of McLaughlin's garage,  also on the Buncrana Road. The  bomb exploded about 20 minutes  later causing superficial damage but a  warning had been given and no one  was injured.  In Creggan, a group of about seven  people tried.to grab a. rifle from a  soldier who fired a shot to free  himself. An Army spokesman said the  incident occurred during a follow-up  operation after a shot had been heard  in the Central Drive area.  BRITISH ARMY  BARRACKS BOMBED  Two soldiers were killed and many  more seriously injured when a bomb  exploded at the fringe of the 80 acre  British Army Camp at Ballykinlar,  Co. Down. A Ford Transit van,  packed with explosives had been left  parked across the road from where  more than 100 off-duty soldiers were  having a mid-morning tea-break.  The vehicle had been hi-jacked by  two armed men in the  Andersonstown area of Belfast and it  'was learned that the driver had been  warned not to inform the police. The  Provisional I.R.A. at Castlewellan  accepted responsibility for the blast.  About 600 soldiers are based at  Ballykinlar and the headquarters of  the local Ulster Defence Regiment  battalion are also there. Apart from  one gunfire attack and two mortar  bombs being aimed at it, the I.R.A.  have kept away from the camp. The  two soldiers who died were named as  Private Michael Swanick(20) from  Birkenhead and Lance Corporal Alan  Coughlan (22) from Newport.  CLASHES AT   TROOPS OUT RALLY  Trouble flared between police and  demonstrators on October 27th at a  London rally demanding British  withdrawal from Northern Ireland.  Arrests were made after scuffling  broke out minutes after the 2,000  demonstrators reached Temple Green  off Victoria Embankment following a  three-mile march through Central  London.  Trouble began after one man was  arrested. Within minutes punches  were being thrown and running  scuffles developed as police made  further arrests. Brian Grogan, an  organiser said:  Prova-.  cateurs -Special Branch men and  right-wingers deliberately started  scuffling in the crowd.   The marchers were demanding the  pull out of British troops together  with self determination for the Irish  people as a whole.  Miss Joan Maynard, the Left Wing  Labour M.P. for Sheffield Brightside,  and three other delegates - including  another Labour M.P. Mr. Stan Thome  - handed a letter listing the demands  into 10 Downing Street.  Miss Maynard said:  I am not  asking for troops to be pulled out  next week or next month but we  must set a date and I think it should  be sooner rather than later. Britain  began the Irish problem but will never  be able to solve it.   Bainbridge Deli  2641 Bainbridge Ave.  236 f.

        <pagetext>Irish May Be Most Fed But  They Are Not The Best Fed,  Says Lecturer On Nutrition  By  DR. DAVID NOWLAN  Government and the absentee  landlords could never have come to  fruition.   Between 1785 and 1841 there was  an unprecedented population  explosion in Ireland. The population  increased from three millions to over  eight millions-an explosion that  would have been impossible to sustain  had the potato not been available at  that time to feed the people. A  vicious circle was started in which  more potatoes were required to  support more and more peopfe and  more prolific varieties of potato were  introduced. But these newer varieties  were more susceptible to disease and  consequently the stage was set for the  potato famines.  After the famines, the whole  pattern of fertility changed again and  by the 1880s agricultural reform had  been effected and, said Dr. Doyle, the  diet of the general population had  greatly improved. But poverty was  still widespread, especially in the  cities. By 1914 26,000 families lived  in 5,000 tenement houses in Dublin.  Great strides had been made since  the foundation of the State, said Dr.  Doyle, and all could be justly proud  of the improvement in general  standards of living and in the  reduction of poverty. But he warned  against complacency:  It is obvious  to anybody who travels our towns  and countryside that many families  even today fall below the bare  subsistence existence.   Yet in 1974, he went on, no person  or agency in the State is actually  aware of our true nutritional status.  Dr. Doyle urged a repetition of the   magnificent and significant   nutrition survey conducted by the  Department of Health in 1948. That  survey (which included very detailed  and specific nutritional data) had  shown that the total per capita calorie  intake was 2,800 a day. More recent  figures relseased by the O.E.C.D. and  the World Health Organisation show  that Ireland now has an average per  capita calorie intake of 3,473 a  day-one of the highest in the world.  The Irish are probably still the  world's largest consumers of  potatoes: they consume 124 metric  tons per thousand of the population,  compared with, for instance, 98 per  thousand in France, 83 in Denmark  f  mg mg and 14 in JaPan- And while the Irish  vi GOli   XJ consume   almost   double  the  milk  products recorded for any other  country, the consumption of fruit,  fish and vegetable oils in Ireland is  low. By contrast, the consumption of  refined sugars is higher in Ireland than  THE IRISH may be the most fed  people in the world, but they are not  the best fed. This was made clear in  the Royal College of Surgeons,  Dublin, on Saturday night, when Dr.  J. Stephen Doyle called for the  development of a national nutrition  policy.  Dr. Doyle, a consultant in the  Richmond Hospital, Dublin, was  delivering his presidential address to  the Biological Society of the R.C.S.I.  and, in a comprehensive historical  review of nutrition in Ireland, he  managed to cast considerable doubts  on the contribution made by the  potato to this country's history.  Prior to the introduction of the  potato in the late 16th or early 17th  century, the Irish, Dr. Doyle said,  were very well fed on a most varied  diet of cereals, fruits,vegetables, milk  and milk products, meats and  poultry. The main source of  sweetening was honey, and from this  came also the mead which was a  prominent liquor. But more prevalent  was ale, made from barley, and wine  was imported from the Continent.  The potato almost certainly came  into Ireland by way of this European  trade and not, as has traditionally  been accepted, through its  importation by Sir Walter Raleigh  (who probably never met the  common potato, although he may  have brought sweet potatoes to  Youghal from either Virginia or the  Azores).  Whatever its means of entry to the  Irish agronomy, Dr. Doyle endorsed  the view put forward by Dr. A. T.  Lucas when he said that the  introduction of the potato was  an  ethnographical disaster leading to a  fearfully over-simplified existence for  a very considerable fraction of the  population with the consequent  disappearance of many of the  activities associated with older  methods of food production and a  quite abnormal truncation of many  aspects of Irish rural life in the 18th  and 19th centuries.  As Dr. Doyle  himslef put it:  Without this root  vegetable, Solanum tuberosum, the  Machievellian activities of the London  ?L   F Challenge  To  The National A -jucion for Irish  Freedom has this date sent the  following letter to Hugh L. Carey,  Governor-elect of the State of New  York.  elsewhere. 'These figures,  said Dr.  Doyle,    indicate   that   there   is a  complete lack of a national nutrition  policy at this time in our country.    INCREASED OBESITY   He argued that, in contrast with  the 19th century, the Irish are now  suffering from over-nutrition, which  he defined as  food intake exceeding  calorie expenditure leading to  increased obesity.  As a result, and in  common with other communities, the  Irish are now suffering an epidemic of  heart and blood vessel disease. 'The  combination of this immediate  problem with the closely associated  problem of fibre-depleted diets is one  which must be tackled and tackled  urgently by our Department of  Health,  said Dr. Doyle.  He proposed the urgent setting-up  of a national nutrition council on  which would be represented animal  and human nutritionists, dieticians,  doctors and both the producers and  consumers of foodstuffs. Dr. Doyle  noted that positive action had solved  earlier medical problems: the  establishment of fever hospitals had  controlled the epidemic diseases of  typhus and cholera, and more  recently tuberculosis had been almost  completely eradicated.  We must now  turn to the latest cause of epidemics  in our midst and treat this problem as  radically as previously,  he said.  He thought it unfortunate that  there was  a grave shortage of troops  to fight this particular war  only 22  full-time dieticians are employed by  hospitals or local authorities, he  pointed out.  I would suggest that it  is time that Irish lives were saved by  enabling dieticians to educate our  people,  said Dr. Doyle, adding that a  national nutrition policy would not  only save lives but would also save  money-by saving bed-days in Irish  hospitals.  He concluded: 'The next decade is  critical in the nutritional status of the  Irish and positive action must be  taken by the Government to prevent  further disasters. Now is the time to  give example to our modern  communities and change the Irish  from being the greatest calorie  consumers to being the best fed  people in the world.   SPECTACULAR ADVOCACY  Dr. Doyle was followed by Mr.  Denis Burkitt, the internationally-known Irish surgeon, who  delivered what can only be described  as a spectacular advocacy of the need  to get more fibre into the average  diet. Man, he said, might well eat a  diet that was nutritionally adequate  but his concern was with the  non-nutritional element of that diet.  Clark Defends  Baltimore Four  Former United States Attorney  General Ramsey Clark has joined the  Irish Lawyers Defense Committee and  is expected to argue the case of the  Baltimore Four in the Federal Court  Baltimore on November 11,1974.  The  Four,  Michale Larkin, Jim  Conlon, Frank McMahon, and Harry  Hillick were given six (6) years in  the Federal Penitentiary on July 8,  1974, by Judge Edward Northrop, Jr.  following their conviction for  Violating the Gun Control Act of  1968. The circumstances surrounding  the conviction indicated that U.S.  Government Agents had apprehended  a large shipment of arms believed  bound to the I.R.A. in Northern  Ireland.  Since their incarceration, the four  men have been subjected to unusually  harsh treatment. They have been  separated, kept in solitary  confinement for long periods and  assigned to maximum security prisons  far removed from their families and  friends.  Jim Conlon, a native of Belfast,  married and with four (4) small  children has been sent to  Leavenworth, Kansas, some 1,500  miles from his home in Queens. His  family lacks the prohibitive financial  resources needed to visit him there.  Similarly, Frank McMahon, who is  in Atlanta, Georgia, and Harry  Hillick, who is in Terre Haute,  Indiana, have been effectively  deprived of their visitation rights by  the long distances that separate them  from their relatives. Mr. McMahon's  only sister in the U.S. is a nun living  in the outskirts of Philadelphia, while  He attributed the increase in Western  societies of a large number of diseases  to the fact that Western diets were  seriously deficient in fibre, and drew  a correlation between the size and  softness of the stool with the absence  of such conditions as piles, hiatus  hernia, gall-bladder disease,  inflamation and cancer of the large  bowel, appendicitis and increased  serum cholesterol.  Paradoxically, perhaps, the more  fibrous the food the softer the stool.   What goes in hard comes out soft,   said Mr. Burkitt,  and what goes in  soft comes out hard.  This might be  why, in Africa, where the fibre  content of the diet is high, the  conditions listed were practically  non-existent. More money was now  spent in one year removing gall  bladders from North Americans than  on total health care in all of Africa,  he said.  Mr. Burkitt was followed by Dr.  Brendan   Hensey,  secretary  of the  Continued on Page 17  Mr. Hillick's brothers and sisters live  in Queens and Nassau Counties in  New York.  Michael Larkin, the only native  U.S. bom of the Four, is in  Lewisburg, Pennsylvania where he has  been repeatedly questioned about his  Irish Activities and where on at least  one occasion he has been the subject1  of camera surveillance from the  roof-top of an adjoining building in  the prison complex.  But the most distrubing feature of  their confinement so far has. been  their repeated visits from U.S.  Government Treasury Agents. These  agents, some of whom participated in  their actual trial and sat at the  prosecutors table, have visited some  or all of the Four at different times in  an effort to get them to discuss  details of the incidents which led to  their convictions. The men never  received any notice in advance of  their coming and have never been  given an opportunity to have counsel  present during the interview.  In one instance, Jim Conlon had a  visit from two agents who told him  for the first time that he was to be  deported to Belfast but, they  indicated, they would prevent this, if  he would only talk to the Attorney  General. Two (2) days following their  visit, he received a Notice of  Commencement of Deportation  proceedings  to Belfast  from the  Department of Immigration and  Naturalization. It has been surmised  that both agencies are combining  their functions to  pressure  Mr.  Conlon to  talkwith  the Attorney  General.  The same two (2) agents who  visited Mr. Conlon in Leavenworth  also visited Mr. McMahon in Atlanta  and in the past week, Mr. Hillick has  likewise been informed of  Deportation proceedings.  All of the above have prompted the  bringing of a motion for review of  sentence before Judge Northrop on  the ground that his function in  determining punishment has been  usurped by the punitive actions of  Government Agencies, the Bureau of  Prisons and the Attorney Generals  Office who have, by these actions,  enlarged upon the sentence of the  Court.  Mr. Clark has long been an  Advocate of Federal Prison Reform  and is no stranger to the Irish  American scene. A Native of Texas,  he gave repeated counsel to the  attorneys for the Fort Worth Five  during their fight for the release of  the men from Tarrant County Jail  and he was defense counsel along  with Paul O'Dwyer on the Berrigan  case in Pennsylvania.   ?  en  x  m  3  35  x  -o  m  O  r-  m     s  CD  3  cr  CD  G gt;  We congratulate you on your  outstanding victory this past week. In  view of your positions now as head of  the Democratic Party in the second  most populous state in the nation, as  well as being an individual now being  talked about openly as a possible  national candidate in 1976, we urge  that you have the question of  Northern Ireland brought before the  mid-term Democratic Party  Convention in Kansas City this  December.  We would urge that the Democratic  Party be put on record as supporting  the full implementation of civil rights  for the people in the North of  Ireland, As the minimum steps in this  direction, this would require that the  Convention support the following  demands as voiced by the Northern  Ireland Civil Rights Association:  Immediate end to internment  Repeal, in total, of the Emergency  Provisions Act  The withdrawal of troops to  barracks pending their complete  withdrawal  We would expect that these  legitimate demands will gain the  support of all people who believe in  the cause of elementary justice.  Statements of concern by individuals  are no longer enough. It must be the  stated policy of the Democratic Party  to pursue these basic demands.  WEB  OFFSET  uonQuord  offset printers  inc.

        <pagetext>CD  LU  -J  O.  O  LU  Ou  X  CO  British Minister's Car Is Blasted  A BRITISH Labour Minister's car  exploded with his wife and son inside.  The car- belonging to Sports Minister  Mr. Denis Howell-was blasted in the  driveway of his Moseley  (Birmingham) home.  Mr. Howell's wife and son, David  (10), were  badly shaken  but  otherwise unhurt.  Mr. Howell said  Apparently David  and my wife were taking the car out  of the drive to collect my daughter,  who was with schoolfirends, when it  exploded.   Fears of a wave of bomb  assassination attempts mounted and  security was being stepped up as this  was the third bomb in Birmingham in  a week, the previous two having been  found and dismantled.  Mr. Howell, speaking on ITN's  News at Ten, said his wife had used  the car all day.  She drove me to the  station this morning and then did  some shopping in it.  I don't know  what happened to the car but I gather  the windows of the house and the  neighbour's houses have been blown  out.   Asked if he had any idea why he  had been chosen as a target, Mr.  Howell said:   I have no idea. One just uses one's  imagination. I am like a lot of other  innocent victims.'  Next-door neighbour, Mrs. William  Eard, said they ran out after the  explosion.   It was Mr. Howell's car. It was  parked at the side of his house where  there is a space and where he  normally leaves it.   By the time we got outside there  was a small crowd of people and very  shortly police arrived. Mrs. Howell  was perfectly all right.   Immigration  Program On  Cable TV  John Collins, Chairman of the  American Irish National Immigration  Committee will appear on the Irish  Freedom Show on Sunday, November  17th. Mr. Collins will explain the  many problems facing Irishmen and  women wishing to emmigrate to the  United States since the passage of a  restrictive immigration law in 1965.  Other officers of the Immigration  Committee appearing on the panel are  Tom Feeney, Nassau County, Sean  Kelly, Westchester County, and  Eugene Byrne from New Jersey. The  panel members will inform the  viewers of the programs being  initiated to correct the injustices of  the present immigration law. The  immigration problem is a problem  that threatens all Irish-American  organizations and in fact threatens  the future existence of the  Irish-American community and  culture in the United States.  The program also includes opinion  from some local Irish-American  neighborhoods. Pat Lyons, of the  Hi-Spots Showband is interviewed at  the Four Green Fields Pub in  Woodside. Sean Dunphy, currently on  a tour of the U.S., explains his views  at Durty Nelly's Pub in the  Kingsbridge section of the Bronx. The  Inwood area is represented by Terry  Connaughton, President of the Caelic  Athletic Association, and Jim  O'Sullivan of the Tara Irish Gift  Shop. Entertainment on the program  features performances by the  Hi-Spots Showband and the Sean  Dunphy All-Stars.  The program can be seen in  Manhattan on Cable TV, Channel D,  from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on  Sunday, November 17th. It will be  repeated Uptown on Teleprompter  Cable TV, Channel D, from 9 p.m. to  10:00 p.m. on Tuesday, November  19th. The programs are sponsored by  the Washington Heights-lnwood  Chapter of the Free Ireland Clubs.  HOUSES DAMAGED  Police said the blast had damaged  houses nearby with many windows  blown in.  They refused to confirm whether  or not it was a car bomb.  There was no warning given as far  as we know,  said a police  spokesman.  Earlier in the day, Army bomb  disposal experts dismantled a bomb  attached under a car belonging to a  Birmingham   city   magistrate,   Col.  IN CHICAGO IT'S  O'NEILL'S LOUNGE  6100 North West Avenue  Chicago, Illinois 60039  ENTERTAINMENT FRI.   SAT.  (312) ME 7-9888  Geoffrey Grey, in the garage of his  home in Bristol Street, Edgbaston.  It was a similar device to that  found attached to the underside of a  car belonging to magistrate, Mrs.  Eunice Sard, of Wheeleys Road,  Edgbaston, last Thursday when five  sticks of gelignite were used.  Mr. Howell was among Ministers at  the traditional eve-of-Parliament  party at 10 Downing Street when the  car exploded.  Provos Threaten  Black Watch  THREATS of retaliation against  the 1st Battalion, the Black Watch,  which completed a tour of duty in  Andersontown, Belfast, last month,  have been made by the Provisional  I.R.A.  The unit has moved to Colchester  to rejoin families there. Strict security  precautions have been put into effect  at Colchester to guard against possible  reprisal action.  In a statement, the Provisional  I.R.A.'s 1st Battalion in  Andersonstown declared:  We will  not be forced into a stand-up  confrontation with British troops. We  will pick our own time and place.   The Provisionals claimed that  retaliatory action would be taken  because the Black Watch had  acted  like animals  and  terrorised  the  people of Andersonstown.  Whether the threat of reprisals is  merely part of a continuing  propaganda war or not, security  officials at the British army's  Northern Ireland headquarters at  Lisburn said that it obviously could  not be ignored.  The attacks on the Paras at  Aldershot in retaliation for Bloody  Sunday, and last week's bomb at  Ballykinlar, Co. Down, claimed by  the South Down Provisional I.R.A. as  a retaliation against the 1st Battalion,  Duke of Edinburgh's Royal  Regiment, are sufficient precedent to  arouse concern.  All units leaving Northern Ireland  are warned to watch for possible  action by the I.R.A. in England.This  warning will be repeated to members  of the Black Watch.  Officially, the army were saying  little.'They confined their comments  to a brief statement which said:  'Threats such as these are nothing  new from the Provisional I.R.A.   Security sources disclosed the  contents of a hand-written letter  caught in transit between Dave  Morely, said to be Officer  Commanding the Provisional I.R.A.'s  4th Battalion in the Prison, and  Brendan  Darkie  Hughes, former  Belfast Brigade leader, now in  Crumlin Road Jail.  lt;   UNITED EFFORT   The letter was intercepted on  Saturday when a prisoner being  moved to Crumlin Road was spotted  trying to slip it under the daor of  Hughes's cell. In it, Morley  congratulated the prisoners in  Crumlin Road Jail on their riots the  day after Republican prisoners burnt  more than half the camp down.  It said:  This united effort in the  prisons in the North has illustrated  the determination of I.R.A.  volunteers never to bow the knee to  the enemy, even when captured and  greatly outnumbered.  Morley goes on to say that things  are improving in Long Kesh and that  morale is high. Most of those who  received cuts and bruises had  recovered, and those in hospital were  expected back in the next week or so.  A statement smuggled out from  sentenced Republican prisoners in  Long Kesh said they were not  interested in meeting a three-man  delegation from the S.D.L.P. due to  visit the jail tomorrow.  9  *  ********* **      NEWS FROM CHIGAGO*  By John A.

        <pagetext>What Price  An 'Invisible'  Barrier  The Dail was amazed to learn that  the cost of installing the new  electrically-operated barriers at the  two entrances to Leinster House was  19,500 pounds of which 15,000  pounds went to the firm which  supplied and installed the barriers,  and the balance was spent on  buildings and work to prepare the  site.  The information came in a written  reply to Major Vivion de Valera who  asked for the cost of providing the  old pole barriers and the new ones.  Mr. Ryan, Minister'for Finance, told  him the pole barriers were supplied  and installed at a total cost of 900  pounds.  And the nrice of eating in the  restaurants at Leinster House has  risen dramatically this week. Increases  range from 20 to 50 per cent.  Critical Lack Of Engineers  Waterford Badly Hit  THE RELUCTANCE of young  engineers to enter the public sector is  causing major problems for local  authorities throughout the country,  who are finding themselves faced with  an acute shortage of qualified civil  engineering staff.  The difficulties are particularly  appar k in Waterford, where the  coui.ty manager, Mr. C. O'Connor  and the acting city manager, Mr.  T. chael Doody, have prepared a  record estimate for development  schemes, totaling over 51/a million  pounds. Many major works, however,  have been held up because of the  failure to recruit a sufficient number  of engineers for the staff in both the  city and county.  Newly   qualified   engineers   have  3 Die In Accidents  Girls Seriously Injured  A MAN WHOSE wife and two  daughters died in the 1968 Aer  Lingus Viscount crash off the  Wexford coast was killed early on  Saturday morning when his car was in  collision with a CLE. bulk cement  carrier near Perry Bridge, Clonlara,  about four miles from Limerick City.  He was one of three people killed in  road accidents over the weekend.  He was Mr. Ignatius Gallivan, aged  about 45, of Raheen Heights, who  was employed at the new Wyeth  (Ireland) Limited factory, Askeaton,  Co. Limerick. He is survived by his  second wife, three sons, his mother,  brother and sisters.  In another accident Mr. David  Hartigan, aged about 46 years, of  Croom, Co. Limerick, was dead on  admission to the Regional Hospital,  Limerick, after being struck by a car  while walking on the main road near  his home over the weekend.  The man who was killed in a  two-car collision on the  Derry-Limavaddy road at Eglintoh on  Friday night has been named as Mr.  Joseph    McKinney,   aged   48,   of  Hunger Strike  Protest  Continued from Page 4  Brandywell district but no one was  hit.  Widespread rioting and hijacking of  vehicles took place in Dungannon  during which two buses and a number  of cars were set on fire. Troops and  police who were to the scene in an  attempt to clear the blocked  approach roads to the town came  under fire and were forced to retreat.  In Coalisland over 5,000 people  accompanied the remains of Hugh  Coney when they arrived'from the  mortuary at Lagan Bank, Belfast. A  volley of shots were fired over the  hearse by men wearing paramilitary  uniforms and no troops or police  were.visible in the area.  the circumstances of the fatal  shooting of 24-year-old Mr. Coney  would be investigated by the RUC  and the British army's special  investigation branch, the Secretary  for State, Mr. Rees, told the British  House of Commons yesterday.  The escape tunnel had only been  recently dug, it is believed, when it  was decided to take advantage of the  disruption of normal procedures at  the camp following the recent  burnings.  Using spoons and other crude  tools, the men in Cage 5, known as  the  Mole Hill  because of previous  tunnelings, began to excavate and  went five feet down and 65 yards  across until they were just outside the  final perimeter fence.  Film issued by the Northern  Ireland Office showed compound  five, with a hole 18 inches in diameter  in the floor of the hut and it was  through this hole that the 30 or so  men made their attempt for freedom.  Soil brought out of the tunnel was  not noticed because it was scattered  Gortgar    Cottages,    Greysteel,    Co.  Derry.  His five-year-old daughter,  Catherine Anne, who was seriously  injured, was reported to be showing  continuing improvement. She is in  Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry.  Mrs. Mary O'Hare, of 56 Hillcrest  East, Lucan, Co. Dublin, was injured  yesterday afternoon when her car  overturned at Cooladangan Bridge  near Arklow, Co. Wicklow. She was  taken to St. Columcille's Hospital, in  Loughlinstown, where she was said to  be in a comfortable condition.     Gardai in Dublin were still  investigating the accident at Milltown  Road early yesterday morning when a  white Jaguar car went out of control,  struck three oncoming cars, and  eventually ended up in the Dodder  river. When gardai arrived on the  scene there was nobody in the car and  its engine was still ticking over as it  lay partially submerged in the water.  Gardai think that the car may have  been stolen and the occupant ran  away after the crash. None of the  people in the three cars it hit were  injured.  among the blaze debris.  A spokesman at the Northern  Ireland office said it was not known  when the tunnel had been.started,  although republican sources in the  city seem to believe it began shortly  after the fire.  When the detainees started their  break-out the area around the camp  was shrouded in thick mist and  visibility was reduced to about 300  yards. The men went under three  fences and came up just outside the  blast fence.  It was then according to British  Army statements that they were  discovered by a  routine Army  patrol . Most of the men were  quickly rounded up but some others,  who had split into small groups, had  already passed through tangles of      barbed wire further on.  One of these groups passed a new  army watch tower close to the M1  motorway and at this point the army  says, they were challenged, failed to  stop, and two shots were fired killing  Cooney.  The British army said that it  appeared some of the men were  armed. But a spokesman at the  Northern Ireland Office said that no  weapons were recovered in  subsequent follow-up searches.  Disturbance broke out in  republican compounds shortly after  the escape and republican detainees  tried to stage a breakout through the  main gates. The British army was  called in by the Governor and rubber  bullets and CS. gas were used to quell  the rioting.  Seventy members of Provisional  Sinn Fein staged a torchlight protest  march through the centre of Dublin.  They were led by four men carrying a  mock coffin shoulder-high and  marchers carried banners calling for  an end to internment and comparing  Long Kesh with Coldftz and Belsen.  been drifting to the private sectors  where incentives seem to be much  greater. And the president of the  Institution of Engineers of Ireland,  Mr. Finbarr Callanan, warned last  night that the trend would continue  unless the local authorities and the  public service urgently up-dated their   old administrative structures.   INDUSTRY  Mr. Callanan, whose organization  represents 2,500 of the 3,500  engineers in the country, said last  night that about 250 engineers per  year were graduating for our  universities.   Ireland is advancing industrially at  a great rate, but we still have the  smallest number of engineers per  1,000 of population of -all the  developed countries of the world,  he  said.  The majority of our engineers  are employed the public sector-  something which is not the case in  more highly industrialised countries.   But the trend is changing and  engineers find a lack of fulfillment  now in the public service, where they  feel they have been tied to old  administrative structures geared to an  ongoing, rather than a  forward-looking structure,  Mr.  Callanan said.  The Institution, he said, had  submitted proposals of various kinds  to the Department of Local  Government and two reports-the  Donovan Report and the Clerkin  Report-on the restructuring of local  authorities had also been submitted.   No action has been taken,  Mr.  Callanan added.  With the increasing  industrialisation, he said, young  engineers were  very reluctant  to go  into local authority structures, where  there was limited advancement, when  they could go into the private sector  where they had a better future.   There is a big number of vacancies  in local authorities at the moment,   said Mr. Callanan. Twenty years ago,  a local authority position was a very  prized one, indeed, but not any more.  Mr. Callanan said Waterford's  problem was not by any means  peculiar. His organization had had  reports of a similar position in various  parts of the country, including  Dublin.  We have heard of these  problems from all over-and I am sure  the Minister, Mr. Tully, is hearing  them regularly, too,  he said.  Commenting on the increased  estimates for the 1975 financial year  for Waterford City and county, acting  city manager Mr. Doody said that a  serious aspect of the entire  development programmes was the  critical shortage of engineering staff.  This continued to impede progress in  many services and unless the staffing  position improved it would be  difficult to fulfil the entire  programme.  Mr. Doody said that with a total  budget for 1975 in excess of 5.3  million pounds it was imperative that  this staffing problem should continue  to receive close attention and it was a  matter which the Department of  Local Government should consider  very seriously.  The Waterford Co. Manager, Mr.  O'Connor, said the County Council  was equally concerned about the  situation and both he and Mr. Doody  had advertised extensively over the  past six months to recruit civil  engineers but the response so far has  been most unsatisfactory.  No improvement in this respect  was expected until conditions and  incentives had been made more  attractive for engineers in the public  sectors, Mr. O'Connor added.  Gl Insurance P  l  ies  BRONX, N.Y. - Many veterans  allow their Gl insurance policies to  lapse because of neglect rather than  intent, according to Frank V. Votto,  Director, New York State Division of  Veterans' Affairs.  A number of them, he said,  develop the habit of riding the grace  period for premium payments. Then,  NUTRITION  Continued from Page 15  Department of Health, who brought  some cool Civil Service caution to Dr.  Doyle's advocacy of a national  nutrition council. It would be very  difficult, he said, for the Department  of Health to undertake an education      or publicity programme in respect of  nutrition. For one thing it was  difficult to convince people to eat  things other than what they liked to  eat. For another, there would have to  be one education policy for the rich  and another for the poor.  Further, the Department might  find itself in conflict with many other  national interests like Bord Bainneor  the Pigs and Bacon Commission. And  finally, Dr. Hensey suggested, it  would be difficult to advocate a  particular nutritional policy when the  doctors themselves were frequently in  a state of disagreement on just what  nutrition was best. He wondered if it  might not be more realistic for the  Department of Health to aim at  trying to change the whole way of life  (by, for instance, encouraging people  to take more exercise) rather than  concentrating soley on nutrition. This  was the sort of question, he added,  which the proposed health education  bureau would be asked to look into.  Other speakers on Saturday night  were Dr. Harry O'Flanagan, registrar  of the College of Surgeons, who  spoke on progress in the building of  the new college in York Street, and  Dr. A. H. G. Love, professor of  experimental medicine in Queen's  , University,  .Belfast  they forget to mail their payment  before the deadline, unknowingly  allowing their policies to lapse.  This lapse often occurs, the  Director noted, just when a veteran's  family needs adequate insurance  protection.  Director Votto urged area veterans,   hooked on this habit,  to overcome  it by bringing premium payments up  to date and by making future  payments before the grace period.  He also reminded veterans to  include their mailing address and  insurance policy number with all  correspondence concerning their  government insurance. This, he said,  will insure prompt and proper  attention to their inquiries.  The Director invited veterans  seeking information on the various Gl  insurance programs to visit the local  counseling center of the New York  State Division of Veterans' Affairs  located at 310 E. Kingsbridge Road or  1910 Monterey Ave. or call  584-3274,731-8070.  Thanksgiving Eve  Benefit For  Legal Aid  BRONX, N.Y.-ln Baltimore,  Maryland, on July 8, 1974, four men  accused of transporting guns from  Maryland to New York and intended  for the North of Ireland were  sentenced to prison terms of six years  each despite pleas that they had  committed no crime against the  United States. The four men have  since been referred to as the   Baltimore Four.  The four are  James Conlon, resident of Queens,  N.Y.; Kiernan F. McMahon, resident      of Silver Springs, Maryland; Harry1     Hillik, resident of Washington, D.C; '  and Francis M. Larkin, resident of  Riverdale, Maryland.  During the trial, Defense Attorney  Frank Durkin of the firm of O'Dwyer    Bernstein told U.S. District Judge  Edward S. Northrop that 'Their  brothers and sisters are dying and  they felt they should respond to a cry  for help.  Indeed, Mr. Conlon had  given expression to the motivations of  the four men when he declared during  the trial that  Someone has to help  our people.  At the trial Judge  Northrop said that  I find it difficult  to sentence you men, because  although you have violated the law,  you are not criminals in the true  sense.  However, since sentencing the  four men have received unusually  harsh and punitive treatment. They  were first kept in solitary  confinement, then sent to four  separate maximum security prisons in  various parts of the country, and their  right to attend Mass was suspended  for a time.  Great hardship is placed on the  families of the men in that their  efforts to exercise their right to visit  the men in prison are very much  thwarted due to traveling expense. In  the case of Mr. Conlon, who resides in  Queens, N.Y. and is confined to  prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, his  wife and four children certainly  cannot look forward to exercising  their visiting rights.  Additional and very alarming  harassment has been meted out to Mr.  Conlon and Mr. Hillik. They have  been put under threat of deportation  if they do not cooperate with  government agents who have visited  them in prison.  An appeal on behalf of these men  will be made in mid-November. In the  hope of defraying some of the costs  of legal defense and to make it  possible for the men to be visited by  their families, Bronx Division of the  Irish-American Legal.Aid Fund will  hold a dance on Thanksgiving Eve,  November 27th, at Gaelic Park  Casino. Honoary chairmen of the  dance are Michael Gorman and Phil  Brennan, the Chairman is Jim O'Gara.  Music at the dance will be donated  by the Hibernians. Admission to the  dance is  5.00 per person. For tickets  and information please call 367-7128  or 242-1765.  On this Thanksgiving Eve, please  come and show your support of those  who are giving so much for Freedom.   ?

The few Dublin supporters who  opted against the journey to Killarney  would prefer to see it in the light of a  fine spirited rally by their favourites,  and this viewpoint would be justified,  for when the Dubliners found their  rhythm after numerous changes in the  second half they were most  convincing.  Tipperary had enjoyed a five  points' lead with wind advantage to  come at the interval, but it was they  who were fighting for the equaliser as  time ran out.  The Dublin changes, both  positional and in personnel, played a  vital part in the side's comeback  against all the odds.

The body wants all of Ireland  united as one nation and its future  government determined by a vote of  all the people, both north and south.  The Knights condemned the  suspension of civil rights, and  imprisonment without trial, existing  today under English rule.

It was resolved  to join  Right to Life  groups which  are seeking a Constitutional  Amendment to reverse the Supreme  Court decision.  Efforts to secure government aid to  non-public schools are to be  continued as the failure to secure aid  will result in the closing of many  private schools and deny to parents  their basic right to determine the  education of their children. Closing of  non-public schools is seen as resulting  in a monopoly of education by State  and Federal government and contrary  to the history of education in  America allowing parents freedom of  choice in education.  ipperary   gt;ing Draw  Tom Grealish switched from midfield  to left corner forward than he was  chasing a ball sent through by Pat  Quigley to hammer home their vital  goal 12 minutes into the second half.  It was perhaps the one occasion on  which the strong Tipperary defence  was completely outwitted.  Eugene Davey's inclusion for the  second half to replace Mick Q'Hanlon  was also highly effective and he was  quick to justify the move when  scoring with his first shot a couple of  minutes into the second half. Then  there was the change which brought  Vinnie Holden to the left flank of  attack mid-way through the second  half, with Mossy Walsh coming in at  right half back and Mick Bermingham  going off.  The Dublin tails were up in earnest  once Grealish ran through for that  goal and Vinnie Holden had a point  almost immediately to leave only 3  points between them. Cunningham,  the tried and tested Dublin  goalkeeper, then served notice that he  was not going to be beaten for a  second goal, when saving brilliantly  from Paul Byrne and when play  swung to the other end it was  Grealish popping up again to hit  another Dublin point   1-10 to 1-8.  Pat Quigley began to raise his game  and the Tipperary midfield pairing of  Seamus Hogan and Jim Kehoe had  already lost much of its first-half  glitter. Noel O'Dwyer, however, met  his now overburdened task well at  centre half-back, but Dublin were  shaping as likely winners and a  palmed point by Vinnie Holden  followed up by a great left-handed  point from Davey had the home side  in front for the first time with fewer  than four minutes remaining.  It was Tipperary mid-fielder  Hogan, who salvaged a point a minute  later.  Too many of the Tipperary attack  were off-colour, John Flanagan  especially, who for once did not get  among the scorers, Francis  Loughnane, though, was effective as  ever, although three of his six points  came off frees. The Tipperary defence  was for so long the strongest sector of  the side with Jim Keogh, Jack Bergin,  Noel O'Dwyer and Tadgh O'Connor  up to his retiral doing best.  It was, perhaps, an indication of  what was to follow when Dublin  clipped over the best three points of  the first half, one a great effort by  centre-back Peadar Carton from 90  yards.  Cunningham inspired confidence in  the Dublin defence, which also had  heroes in Kevin Drumgoole, Peadar  Carton, Tom Quinn and versatile  Vinnie Holden, Harry Dalton and Pat  Quigley constituted Dublin's most  successful mid-field pairing, while  Grealish gained most credit marks  along with Davey as attackers.  It all left Tipperary with a strange  League record-three draws so far  from four matches.  Cv T  OH  TOCK  8Y OTTOT.

Yep, that seemingly endless past  performance line is heading for the  home lane. Preceding articles have  dealt with most of that informative  and sometimes frustrating  story of a  race in a line  but the rest of it  should be a cinch. The last article was  devoted to the  calls    the position  of the horse at various pre-determined  stages of the race: where he was in  relation to the leader, so you could  see for yourself whether he was  showing early speed, running what is  termed an  even  race (in the middle  of the pack, probably, getting  nowhere in particular) or coming  from behind.  Needless to say, he didn't get  anywhere by himself. There was a  jockey on his back. And the name of  the jockeys is the next thing you will  see in the past performance line. It  could be  Cordero A Jr  or  Valenzuela J  or any one of the  dozens of riders who ply their trade  at major tracks like Aqueduct.  Belmont Park or Saratoga. You'll  rarely see a boy (or girl) from the   sticks  on a mount in New York  because the competition is too keen.  Incidentally, the rider's last name  always precedes his initial in the p.p's.  Some jockeys, obviously, are better  than others. And the better ones win  most of the races, and most of the  cash and glory that is their reward.  The rider who gets a horse in the  money gets 10 per cent of the pot.  Frequently that amounts to quite a  bit of cabbage. For example, when  Big Spruce captured the long end of  the purse in the  250,000 Marlboro  Cup at Belmont his owner's share of  the prize was  150,000. Mike Hole,  who rode Big Spruce, received   15,000 for his less than two minutes  work. Not bad, but remember that  Mike, like most jockeys, had to come  up the hard way. Had to learn his  trade, gain the confidence of owners  and trainers, before he was given the  opportunity to shoot at the big  money.  What is the  hard way?  A rider  may begin as a groom, a  hot walker   (cooling off horses after a workout or  a race), or as an exercise boy. It is  easy to determine the ridirig beginners  in the p.p. line because they may have  a small numeral-5, 7, or  10   following their names (Long  JS7). These figures represent weight  allowances and the boys (or girls)  with allowances are called  apprentices. Before the figures were  used the novices were called  bug  boys  not because they didn't bathe  or take showers, but because the  allowances were indicated by asterisks  (*) instead of numerals. A  bug boy   had a five-pound allowance; a   double bug  boy had a seven-pound  allowance; a  triple bug boy  had a  10-pound allowance.  The allowances give newcomers an  opportunity to compete with more  experienced riders; get them mounts  they would never receive if they had  to compete on even-terms with  jockeys who have been through the  mill. The rider gets a 10-pound  allowance until he has ridden 5  winners and 7 pounds until he has  ridden an additional 30 winners from  the date of riding his fifth winner. If  he has ridden 35 winners prior to the  end of one year from the date of  riding his fifth winner, he continues  to receive that 5-pound allowance  until the end of that year.  There are also 3-pound allowances  and they are granted riders who, after  completing their apprenticeships, are  astride horses owned or trained by  their original contract employers if  their contracts have not been  permanently transferred or sold since  they rode their first winner. That's a  reward for the owner or trainer who  develops a rider and keeps him under  contract. The contract-holder retains  this advantage for one year. Loyalty  pays sometimes.  In studying the past performances  you will note that horses run better  for some riders than they do for  others. Let's say a horse hasn't won  any of his last six races. However,  seven races back when he won, he was  ridden by Jockey Zilch. Today he has  Zilch in the saddle again. It could  mean something. Give the shift your  undivided attention  A clue that may  mean money.  We'll continue the series next  week.  Wexford  Slash Limerick  Wexford 2-12   Limerick 0-4  Wexford were impressive winners  of the National Hurling League tie  against Limerick at Wexford Park  which was dictated by the gale-force  wind. The home side were totally  dominant for three-quarters of the  game and their margin of victory was  a decisive 14 points.  A strong defence, in which Mick  Jacob, Teddy O'Connor and Willie  Murphy were outstanding, tied down  the Limerick attack, who when  assisted by the strong wind in the  opening period shot the amazing total  of 16 wides.  Limerick had nine of those wides-  in the opening eleven minutes and for  that period of pressure they had only  three points to show. Wexford then  got gradually on top and only trailed  0-4 to 0-2 at the interval. There was  no change in the trend on the  resumption and once Tony Doran put  Wexford in front with a goal inside  thirty seconds the game was over.  They benefitted from a winning  service at mid-field from Colm Doran  and Martin Casey and when they  eventually relaxed ten minutes from  the end their second goal from John  Murphy gave them a lead of 2-9 to  0-4.

This was a greatly improved  Waterford team that brought out the  best in Kilkenny at Nowlan Park,  Kilkenny, and provided a most  interesting and entertaining game  with hurling of a high standard   Indeed, at the interval after Kilkenny  had played with the strong wind,  their lead of 0-11 to 0-6 looked  precarious enough, but they came out  a new team.  Gone was the seeming lethargy and  they soon realised that they had a  struggle on their hands. The whole  team rose to the occasion, and  employing superb team-work after  sharing a point each with the visitors  in the first five minutes, had some  magnificently worked points to  remove any danger of a surprise,  while the defence, with Noel Skehan  bringing off some tremendous saves,  completely nullified the best efforts  of the Waterford forwards.  Waterford had a point from a  penalty in the first half, but two  penalties in the second half were  blocked and cleared in the Kilkenny  goal, while a number of 70s also  proved unavailing, so tight knit and  sound did the defence become.  Kilkenny opened with three points  before Waterford had their first point.  After 15 minutes, only a point  divided thern at five points to four in  favour for the home team, but in the  second quarter, Kilkenny added six  points to Waterford's two.  Early in the second half, Kilkenny  took command, but their scores were  the result of really brilliant  combination rather than any  weakness appearing in the Waterford  defence.  For the winners, Phil Larkin, Nicky  Orr, Jim Treacy and Pat Henderson  were outstanding in defence. Frank  Cummins and Liam O'Brien stepped  up their game in the second-half at  centrefield and when the forwards  clicked, they gave a delightful  exhibition with Under-21 hurler Ger  Fennelly, who took over for Billy  Fitzpatrick, fitting in nicely with the  experienced Eddie Keher, Ciaran  Purcell, Pat Delaney and  Mick  Brennan.  Waterford was well served in  defence by Patsy Flynn in goal,  Paddy Coady, John Greene and Pat  McGrath. John Galvin gave a useful  service at midfield, and in attack  Mossie Whelan, John Kirwan and  Martin G eary were the most  prominent.  SCORERS-Kilkenny; E. Kehir  (0-8), M. Brennan (0-4), P.

        <pagetext>rag  All  U  V * lib Vd/ ) y/v Vk7 is. The nominations for the Carroll Al  As 1974 fades into history many  will agree that this year was not a  good year for the New York Gaelic  Athletic Association. There were  some bright spots during the year and  these include the successful minor  board and the tours from Ireland,  both at club and county level. The  numbers attending our games continue to fall. Here the officers and clubs  must take the responsibility. On  many, many occasions games started  an hour behind the scheduled time  and there were plenty of Sundays  when it was eight o'clock when I left  the Park after the last game. However,  there was a brief effort made to  correct the late starting but without  the cooperation of the clubs and the  enforcing of the rules all the effort  was wasted.  At the annual convention a new  president was elected. Terry  Connaughton beat Mike Cassidy by 4  votes. There was a very successful  installation of officers and this was  followed by one of the biggest  banquets ever. The signs were very  encouraging indeed. We saw a rules  committee appointed and these  dedicated men spent many hours  deliberating and one of the most  important and far reaching rules they  proposed and passed was that teams  be allowed only three players from  Ireland for any one game and the  names were to be furnished 10 days  in advance of the game. To my  disappointment and to many others  no effort was made to encourage  clubs to consolidate or combine to  form stronger teams and lease better  games and more competitive spirit.  This consolidation or combining or  by whatever name you wish to give it  will have to be given priority action  urgently before clubs are allowed to  affiliate and nomination of officers  take place for 1975. The number of  one sided games witnessed this year  has to be reduced if we are to  continue to attract the paying public  to the Park.  FINALS  There were five competitions  completed, three in hurling and two  in football and the final of the 1973  Senior football championship has  been reached. Both the 1973 junior  championships were completed and  new and worthy champions emerged  in both. It proved a double for Kerry.  First we saw the Kingdom hurlers  play Waterford into the ground in a  one sided final. Just a few weeks ago  the Kerry junior footballers assisted  by players from Ireland beat arch  rivals Limerick in a quiet, sporting  final. Sligo made history when they  recorded their first win of the senior  football championship and victory  was all the sweeter as it was Kerry  they beat in the final.  In the final and the semi-final of  the competition we saw good, open  exhibitions of football. In the decider  both contestants imported heavily  from Ireland.  The senior hurling division must be  commended fo'r their progressive  thinking, first the 1973 senior final  was decided after much uncertainty.  Galway defeated a disappointing  Offaly team in the final. Early in  October Galway were dethroned as  champions by a star-studded  Tipperary fifteen. In this final Galway  had to answer to the Tipperary men  and this victory broke a lean spell for  the winners. So, for the first time in  many years a New York  Championship was decided within the  year. From this division came the first  moves to combine clubs. It was  decided that Wexford and Kilkenny,  combine along with Cork and  Limerick for a special hurling league.  The Cork-Limerick merger fell  through, but the Wexford-Kilkenny  merger seem, at the very least an  improvement and has all the signs of  being a success. That merger plan was  only on a trial basis and only for that  special competition. Any  consolidation of clubs might be made  initially on a trial basis for say 12  months or the life of a particular  competition.: With a little good will  on all sides I think consolidation can  be a success and it would be a great  show of sportsmanship and concern  for the survival of our National  Pastimes if the first moves came from  the clubs. But, if force has to be used  then, in the best interest of the  association coercion is the only  answer.  I have no doubt we will be hearing  much on this particular subject for  the next couple of months. The final  of the 1973 senior football  championship has been reached and  the contestants will be Donegal and  Kerry. Donegal are seeking their first  New York title.  TOURS  This year there were successful  tours made by individual clubs and by  the All-Ireland Champions Kilkenny  and the Ulster football Champions,  Donegal. At club level we saw  Kilcummin, St. Patrick's and Na  haghasaigh in hurling Roscrea and  Ballinsloe. For any clubs thinking of  making the trip to New York, they  should travel early in the Year. The  tour of the All-Ireland Champions  was a rushed decision, so fast that  neither the Kilkenny or Limerick  players were aware of the impending  trip until after the final. Despite the  short notice however, the tour was a  success and New York put up a  creditable showing. There was more  organization and publicity for the  Donegal tour but for some strange  reason they never attracted the  expected full house. As it turned out  Donegal disappointed when they  failed to beat a local New York  fifteen. The New Yorkers gave a good  display and played far better than  anybody expected. For the second  game of the tour Donegal played a  minor board selection and they won  easily.  History has been written and no  doubt it will be long remembered that  it was the first occasion that a team  of all American-born players took the  field against a team from Ireland.  Again, I am sure we will be seeing  much more of these fine Americans  playing Gaelic football. On April  20th, 1975 we will have another  opportunity of seeing Kilkenny  playing much tougher opposition-the  Carroll All-Star Selection at Gaelic  Park.  MINOR FOOTBALL  As time goes the minor football ,  movement is going to play a more  important part in the life of New  York G.A.A. Right now, it is difficult  to put a date on it but before very  long they will have to shoulder the  full responsibility of carrying on the  games of the Gael in New York. I will  not dwell too long on the minors as I  hope to do a special article or two  later on this very important facet of  the organisation. There are a few  improvements I would like to see in  the minor division and as the officers  are very progressive I am sure they  will act accordingly.  ANNIVERSARY  This year we celebrated the 60th  anniversary of the Gaelic Athletic  Association in New York and what a  tame event it was. The timing was  wrong; it should not have been  overshadowed by the Kilkenny tour  and should have been marked by a  special day in which only local  players were involved. There is no  telling who or what shape the  organisation will be in 10 years time  when the Gaelic Athletic Association  in Ireland will celebrate its  centenuary.  Australian Rules  Team For Dublin  It is now almost definite that the  two Australian football teams touring  Europe and the U.S. will play in  Croke Park, Dublin on March 8th,  1975. On the following day an  Australian Rules team will play an  Gaelic football team under comprised  rules. This visit may open up the  prospect of Irish team going to  Australia again-.'  The nominations for the Carroll All-  Star football team have been  announced. In all 110 players are listed  for the various positions. Many of the  Dublin players were not considered.  The final selection will be announced  next week and the team will play  against a combined Universities team  on December 8th. In fact this is the  first time that the All-Stars will play together as a team.  In a strange turn of events the star  Dublin goalkeeper has strong con-  tension for the  keeper  spot despite  his brilliant goalkeeper this year.

        <pagetext>CM  (2  UJ  -J  a.  O  LU  O.  I  CO  IRISH SPORTS  By John Twomey  CO  LU  X  National Football League      National Hurling League  Kerry Hold Dublin To Draw   Clare Surprise The Holders  Kerry 0-8 Dublin 0-8  All-Ireland champions Dublin and  league title-holders Kerry made brave  efforts to serve up fast and  entertaining football under almost  impossible conditions at Fitzgerald  Stadium in Killarney.  To their credit, they defied the  elements and provided plenty of  second-half entertainment and  excitement for more than 10,000  spectators.  One league point each from so hard  fought an encounter does nothing to  advance the fortune of either county.  A drizzle-drenched sod and a wind off  the Reeks that, to quote a local,  would skin a gooseberry, made  accuracy and ball control more than  difficult, so a drawn game was  probably, in the end, an equitable  result.  But it was a result that even the  more optimistic of Heffo's hordes,  who made the long trip south in  considerable numbers, could hardly  have hoped for at the interval.  The Dubliners, with that blustering  breeze urging them on from the  scoreboard end, took a two point lead  in an early flourish. Then Kerry,  looking the sharper and more eager  outfit, began to force the pace, even  into the wind.  Mick Sheehy, from Tralee, a  dressingroom replacement for John  Egan, was the hero of the home fans  hereabouts. He kicked two great  points from frees and then punched  the Kingdom into the lead from Ger  O'Driscoll's cross.  The unerring Jimmy Keavaney  brought Dublin level, Pat Spillane  regained the lead for Kerry, but again  it was Keaveney who, with two  classical points, one from a free and  one from play, edged Dublin ahead at  the interval, 0-5 to 04.  In view of the strong wind, that  slim margin did not look nearly  sufficient and when, within 10  minutes of the restart, the men from  the Kingdom had gone a point in  front, a Dublin defeat looked almost  inevitable.  At this stage, however, Paudhie  Lynch, who had dominated at  midfield, but had taken a heavy  knock nearing half-time, switched to  full-forward. Spillane went top of the  right while Dick Spring, seemingly  fully fresh in spite of his rugby  exertions for Munster against the New  Zealanders on Saturday, came on at  midfield.  But, from the moment Lynch  moved, Kerry began to lose their grip  on this game. Brian Mullins, who had  been joined at midfield in the first  half by Anton OToole, now came  thundering into the picture.  He forced the 50 which brought  the balancing point from Keaveney  and then, when a Dublin forward was  fouled close in, took the resultant  penalty. But his hard shot, though it  beat diving goalman Paudhie  O'Mahony, came back off an upright  and was blasted high over the bar by  Bobbie Doyle.  Kerry, heartened by this let-off,  drew level at the match went into the  last quarter, Tony Hanahoe, put clean  through for what seemed a certain  Dublin goal; swept the ball wide.  Again Kerry profited by the mistake  to take the lead with a neat point  from a free by Brendan Lynch seven  minutes from time.  But Dublin were now doing better  than at any other stage in this hour  and must have gained the winning  goal had not O'Mahony managed to,  fly-kick the ball almost from under  his own crossbar. Yet, justice was  done in the end, when the ever  reliable Keaveney kicked the  equalising point from a free in the  58th minute.  On their lethargic first-half display,  this was a game Dublin did not  deserve to win, yet it was a game they  must have won had they taken their  second-half    goaling    chances.  Certainly, except for a couple of  first-half scares, Paddy Cullen had a  quiet afternoon in goal, thanks to the  excellence of a defence in which Alan  Larkin, Sean Doherty and Robbie  Kelleher were outstanding.  Not till OToole switched out did  Dublin come into the game at  midfield, where Mullins had an  outstanding last quarter. The  forwards, however, from the chances  presented, must shoulder the blame  for letting victory slip away. The  exception was veteran Keaveney, who  had all but one of their scores and  was truly the man who saved the day.  Kerry, for much of the hour,  looked every bit as promising as they  did against Offaly but, again, they  faded in the last quarter.  O'Mahony, John O'Keeffe, Jim  Deenihan, Ger Power and Kennelly  were the bulwards of a sound  defence.  Paudhie Lynch was, until injured,  magnificent at midfield, but their  forwards, like those of Dublin,  promised more than they achieved,  with Sheehy, Brendan Lynch and  Mickie O'Sullivan, when he moved off  Kelleher, carrying the greatest threat.  Scorers-Dublin: J. Keaveney (0-7);  B. Doyle (0-1). Kerry-M. Sheehy  (0-5); B. Lynch (0-2); P. Spillane  (0-1).  N.F.L. DIVISION 1  A   P W D L F A Pts.

This year the entire competition will  run for 23 weeks, with each team  playing 23 games. The Board of  Officers that organise and control the  league are as follows:  President: Pat Hunt (Kilcullen    Murrays); V. Pres.: Vin Corrigan  (Horse   Jockey); Executive Sec:  Mike Lynch (Cassidy   Conneelys);  Corresponding and Recording Sec:  John Donaghue (Costello's);  Treasurer: Bill Correale (Kilcullen    Murrays). Rules committee is made  up of three members as follows: Tom  Morley and Sean Kelly (Horse    Jockey) along with Tom Veale of  Briarwood Flights.  Clare 3-6   Cork  1-10  Miserable weather provided a  remarkable contrast to the bright and  thrilling performance of Clare hurlers  as they overcame Cork in a top class  National Hurling League game at  Charleville.  A soggy ground, driving wind and  rain and, indeed, the reputation of  national league holders Cork-all were  brushed aside contemptuously by the  fiery Clare team.  The two sides provided excellent  entertainment for the relatively small  crowd. They went all out for the 60  minutes and every ball and challenge  was fiercely contested by the two  teams.  This made for a rousing, but  sporting game, full of controlled  aggression, with plenty of skill from  both sides.  But Clare were superb. On their  showing yesterday-they were full of  confidence and composure-they  must be in the running for honours  this year.  Every man on the team played a  full part in the victory, but  individuals in each sector of play  made vital contributions.  Goalkeeper Seamus Durack made  some really fine saves at times when  lesser men would have given way  under the pressure exerted by the  eager Cork forwards.  Centre-half-back Noel Casey was  steadfast in the middle, and his  clearances provided a springboard for  plenty of Clare attacks. Midfielders  Tony Kelly and John Callahan  dominated their Cork counterparts  and kept a constant flow of passes to  their forwards.  Up front, the veteran Gus Lohan  gave the Cork backs a roasting they  will not forget in a hurry, and also  scored two goals. Corner-forward  Enda O'Connor deservedly got Clare's  third goal.  Cork played hard and well but  their failure to pick up scores from  play was crucial. Most of their 10  points came from frees by Gerald and  Charlie McCarthy, Clare were that bit  faster than Cork on breaks and the  title-holders frequently found their  defenders a few yards behind the  speedy Clare forward.  The strong cross-field breeze  favoured Clare in the first half.  Lohane struck with his first goal after  only seven minutes when the scores  stood at a point each. Put through by  Jim McNamara, Lohan resisted the  challenge of Cork keeper Martin  Coleman and palmed to the net.  That wasn't too bad a setback for  Cork. They kept hammering away  but, as the half wore on, Clare got  stronger. Nine minutes from  half-time, O'Connor ran at the Cork  goal, looked to have lost control after  a tackle but recovered and scored  with a low ground shot which Cork's  John Horgan vainly tried to block on  the line.  Three minutes later, Cork were  really in trouble when Lohan's  goal-scoring prowess gave Clare a  further advantage.  He shot from close in but the  sliothair rebounded off a defender,  but Lohan scored at the second  attempt. The score at the interval was  3-3 to 0-5 in Clare's favour.  Cork, with the wind behind them,  fought desperately in the second half.  Slowly they picked up the points,  mainly from the free-taking expertise  of the McCarthys. But Clare were still  dangerous on counter-attacks and  they picked up a couple of points to  maintain their lead.  Four minutes from full-time, Cork  looked to have got full reward for  their efforts when a 21-yard penalty  goal by Charlie McCarthy left them  only a point behind. An exciting final ,  three minutes followed, but Noel  Ryan pointed in the last minute to  give Clare the two league points they  deserved.  Scorers: Clare-G. Lohan (2-0), E.  O'Connor(1-0), J. McNamara, N.  Ryan (0-2 each), J. Callanan, C.  Woods (0-1 each). Cork-C. McCarthy  (1-4), G. McCarthy (0-5), E.  O'Donoghue (0-1).  N.H.L DIVISION 1  A   P W D L   F   A Pts.

        <pagetext>Twenty-Five Cents   12.00 per year  people  U.S.P.S. 070-77t    3  rt   ma of  mm mmueaiusM  M AMSMCA  Volume XI  Number 12  March 27, 1982      ILIIMiEl  ENDS VISIT  The whirlwind American tour won by newly elected Free State head Charles  Haughey along with the election from Garret FitzGerald concluded last week  amidst mixed reviews.  New York  The tour began in New York  with a visit to the Economic  Club, comprising prestigious corporate executives and businessmen. Here Haughey's appeal  was for American investment  into the Free State economy.  Haughey asserted that the economy was on sound basis and  nearing the end of recession.  However, as Haughey spoke,  the Punt or Irish Free State  pound, fell under the o;  and fifty cent mark. Haughey  was questioned about the north  and here in a statement which  dramatically contrasted with his  public utterances during his prior  term in office, asserted that  the  principal obstacle in the north  was the British guarantee to  Loyalists... We will have no progress until that is removed.   Haughey also announced that  he believed that the Free State  would soon become an exporter  of oil After the address, Haughey  visited St. Agnes Church on  43rd St., the site of the apartment building where Haughey's  predecessor, Eamon de Valera,  was baptized.  Washington  The newly re-elected Free  State head then journeyed to  Washington, DC. He attended  a White House luncheon with  several Congressmen, Secretary  Charles   Haughey  of State Alexander Haig, and  celebrities, including Maureen  O'Hara. Haughey was called  upon to make an exchange of  toasts. Instead, he spoke at length,  stating:  There is much to be  done. And the first thing is that  Britain be encouraged to seek  more positively and more actively a change in attitude and outlook which would pave the way  for unity and so enable her final  withdrawal from Ireland to take  place with honor and dignity.   Reagan  President Reagan later asserted  that the United States would  not become involved in influencing Vritish policy in Ireland.  This reaction was praised both  by Margaret Thatcher and Ian  Paisley's deputy Peter Robinson. Haughey's position varied  dramatically from his rhetoric  during his first administration,  wherein his visits to America  were marked by attacks upon  Irish-American opposition to  British rule. The remarks generated for Haughey widespread  publicity in Ireland, where Haughey holds a tenuous majority that  may bring a new election within  the year and in which Haughey  is expected to campaign by assuming a mantle of Irish nationalism  while maintaining collaboration  with the British.  A member of the Ulster Defense Association  convicted for the assassination in Larne in 1980 of  Irish Independence Party co-founder, Protestant  John Turnly, claimed in a Belfast court at the  conclusion ofthe trial that he had been working for  the British Army's SAS squad.  Twenty-seven year old Ro-   they were all members of the  bert McConnell named uio two  SAS soldiers whom he claimed  supplied him with information  and with weapons for the killing  and who had discussions with  him on Miriam Daly, Bernadette McAliskey and John Turnly, all of whom were shot by the  UDA in 1980 and 1981 in  attacks claimed under the cover-  name, the Ulster Freedom Fighters. In his statement McConnell  said that  in or around the month  of April 1980,1 was working as  a fish salesman in the Larne  area. I was stopped one day  near Cushendall by a van containing a number of men. I became satisfied subsequently that  SAS and I had dealings with  them on that and a number of  subsequent occasions through  their leaders who were Sergeant  Tom Aiken and Corporal Mc-  Gow.   He said that at their behest he  placed a listening device in a  bar in Cushendall, County Antrim, in which Sinn Fein vice-  president Gerry Adams was allegedly attending a meeting. He  continued:  During a series of  subsequent meetings with them  (the SAS) they discussed with  me Republican leaders and in  particular Turnly, Miriam Daly  and Bernadette McAliskey...  Continued on pg. 13  The two hundred and twentieth St Patrick's Day  Parade in New York, despite a chilling rain, attracted  more than one hundred and ninety bands and tens of  thousands of marchers. A dramatic escalation of  Irish patriotism in this year's parade was a highlight  of the day, led by an Irish Northern Aid contingent  nearly one thousand strong. This contingent included  Sean Sands, whose deceased brother Bobby Sands,  MP,  was  unanimously  named  Honorary Grand  Marshal by the Parade Committee.  (See story page 10)

        <pagetext>2    GAP*61  FITZGERALD'S EIGHT MONTHS AS FREE STATE PREMIER  IS  cu  honesty mate  lyinepti  BY KEVIN BURKE  GARRET FitzGerald's eight-  month term of office as Free  State premier, which ended in  Leinster House on Tuesday,  March 9th, was the shortest  premiership in the history ofthe  state. It ended with his credibility  in tatters and his ineptitude  exposed.  In the dying hours of his government,  on Monday night, the Fine Gael leader  U-turned for the last time, uselessly  abandoning the supposed sacrosanct  strictures of his vicious budget     on  VAT, subsidies and taxation of social  welfare     in a final vain attempt to buy  the necessary independent votes and win  the all-important prize of power.  And capital projects at Whitegateoil refinery,  Arigna mines and Dublin's port and docks site  were blithely promised at a cost which put the  unmentionable Knock airport in the shade.  If his political acumen before the January  budget had matched his lust for power after it,  the general election need not have taken place  and he could still be in office today.  HUNGER-STRIKE  It was on June 30th last year that Garret  FitzGerald's coalition government took over  from that of Charles Haughey, who had, to all  intents and purposes, lost the general election  because of his inaction on the H Block hunger-  strike.  FitzGerald, in the first heady hours of office  pinpointed the hunger-strike as his most urgent  priority. Four hunger-strikers were already dead  at that time; six more were to die.  In the next days he held a meeting with the  British ambassador, significantly veiled in  secrecy. And his first meeting with the hunger-  strikers' relatives on July 3rd, was lengthy, but  already concentrating on persuading them to  undermine the protest.  But following the death of Joe McDonnell  on July 8th, FitzGerald, raising the hunger-  strike for the first time in Leinster House, placed  the onus for tho deaths on the British government. He dispatched two of his senior ministers  to London, and later called on United States  president Ronald Reagan and the EEC to  intervene.  That was the high-point of his hunger-strike  effort. Discovering that actions were needed to  back up his words, he began to back off and by  tho end of July was publicly attempting to  wash his hands of tho crisis. His statements  from then on laid the blame on the IRA leaden  ship not the British government.  In the middle of August, relatives of the  hunger-strikers were forcibly removed from  government buildings.  ECONOMY  Meanwhile, Garret FitzGerald was well into  breaking his first set of economic electoral  promises. From the beginning of his government's term the cry went up that things were  much worse economically than he had imagined  and in fact the state was on the verqe of bank  ruptcy.  His first budget in mid-July, with a plethora  of punitive measures, signalled that the electoral  goodies wore not going to be delivered. Two  days after getting it through Leinster House he  sought to silence criticism within his own party,  and his coalition allies, the Labour Party, by  declaring a long summer holiday for the parliament to the end of October.  But throughout the summer the voices of  protest, among his own supporters and the vital  independents, grew louder, spurred on, as  August drew to a close, by a speech from his  right-wing  Minister  for  Industry John Kelly,      Garret FitzGerald's meeting with Margaret  Thatcher in London in November last year brought  more evidence of his political ineptitude and of his  readinoss to collaborate  likening social welfare recipients to 'cannibal  piglets'.  Almost continuous price increases fuelled  the grumblings and in September when FitzGerald went to chop the Tuam sugar factory as  part of his 'lame ducks' policy, the outcry  forced him to retract. In November, forty  thousand angry farmers marched on Dublin in  piotest at their worsening economic conditions.  FitzGerald turned his attention then to  wage costs and, as the centralised pay-deal talks  headed for collapse, launched a verbal attack  on workers' living standards which was enthusiastically taken up by employers' organisations.  But here again, there was disappointment  with his big talk when, as the year closed, he  agreed a public sector pay increase of 15 ,  which although well below inflation rates, was  most displeasing to pnvate sector employers.  CRUSADE  Under pressure politically because of his  inability to take any effective economic action,  FitzGerald, in September, hit, partly by accident, on a handy diversion.  With monumental hypocrisy, and with much  pious reference to Tone and Davis, he launched  what became known as his 'constitutional  crusade'. Supposed to be a total reform of the  Free State constitution of 1937, it was primarily  aimed, not at lemoving social injustice in the  South, but  at wooing loyalists in the North.  His concentration on the removal of Articles  2 and 3 from the constitution, which claim  territorial jurisdiction over thirty-two counties,  and Ins description of the Free State as sectarian, won him praise ftom Doth the former  Vanguard leader, now Official Unionist, William  Craig, and from the murderous Ulster Defence  Association.  With the hunger-strike over in October, FitzGerald felt the way cleai for more extended  collaboration with Britain. A meeting with  Northern   direct-ruler   James  Prior  in  Dublin  preceded   a   summit  in   London with  British  premier Margaret Thatcher on November 6th.  LONDON  Before FitzGerald went to London he was  nicely set up by Charles Haughey, who claimed  that out of the Anglo-Irish study groups, which  he had himself instigated with Thatcher, would  come great things including a three-tier Anglo-  Irish Council which should be announced at the  forthcoming meeting.  FitzGerald returned from London with an  Anglo-Irish Council which was merely a name  stuck on the existing system of meetings  between government leaders and civil servants.  He did not have the third tier, much-vaunted by  Haughey, of a council of parliamentary members  from London and Dublin. In London, FitzGerald  had been craven. Humiliated by Britain's  contempt for its weak hunger-strike protests,  and trumpeting abroad that his state was  bankrupt, he cut a sorry figure. To win his way  back into Britain's good books he promised  further collaboration in the future by way of  joint courts to include Northern judges to try  political offences in the South and by allowing  RUC men to interrogate suspects in Free State  garda stations.  Meanwhile, both sides agreed to give the  Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act a further  try as an alternative to extradition, and by the  end of his term in office FitzGerald had six of  the Crumlin Road escapees imprisoned by the  Dublin Special Court and the first Irishman in  the same dock for political offences alleged to  have taken place in England.  Also, on the home front, legislation was  being prepared to extend already repressive  legislation, to end the right to bail, the right  to silence in custody and further extend garda  powers.  CENSORSHIP  But Garret FitzGerald will not just be  remembered for his ardent collaboration with  Britain nor for the viciousness of his economic  measures in breach of his election promises.  There were plenty of other memorable points  which left his personal imprint on the office  of Free State premier.  Although a supposed liberal, he has nothing  to show from his term to support this image.  On the question of political censorship he  displayed his attitude by the appointment of  the hard-line Patrick Cooney as Minister for  Posts and Telegraphs.  In August, he drew widespread criticism at  home, and derision abroad, by banning the  newly elected Westminster MP for Fermanagh  and South Tyrone, Owen Carron, from RTE.  And in the January election FitzGerald's  determination to silence his republican critics,  inspired an extension on the ban on Sinn Fein,  which backfired when the enabling legislation  was ruled unconstitutional by a High Court  judge.  JOBBERY  Among the few grateful admirers who FitzGerald will have won for his period as premier  are the British agents, the Littlejohn brothers,  and the loyalist bomber Norman Parkinson of  the UDA, all of whom were freed early from  Mountjoy prison.  There are also several beneficiaries of his  corrupt patronage in the form of highly-  paid jobs in the government and civil service.  During his short spell, an array of political  appointments of this kind include several of his  political cronies and their relatives, including  his own son and daughter-in-law. Even in the  dying days of his government the hypocrite  who had previously denounced political  jobbery made partisan appointments in the  garda, the judiciary and to state bodies.  Garret FitzGerald goes down as yet another  Irish leader who has failed and betrayed his  people.  Eight months of Garret FitzGerald were  more than enough.  Dublin's  Clemency for  UDA Prisoner  The surprise release from  Mountjoy Prison of UDA man  Frederick Parkinson has produced some criticism alleging  that the same humanitarian concern is not extended to Republican prisoners on either side of  the Border.  Parkinson (37), the father of  two children, was serving a 12-  year sentence for an attempted  firebomb blitz in Dublin. He  was convicted of having incendiary devices and firearms in  1977. He would have been due  for release in 1986 with full  remission.  But, following intervention on  his behalf by various people and  organizations, he has been given  a full remission on humanitarian  grounds     on condition that he  does not come back into the  Free State.  For much of his period in  Mountjoy, Parkinson shared accommodations in the prison's  basement with the Littlejohn  brothers who were released last  year, also on humanitarian  grounds, with half their sentences  still to serve.  Among the organizations which  worked for Parkinson's release  was the Catholic lay organization, the Knights of St. Colum-  banus. Among the individuals  who helped were Bishop Com-  iskey, one of Dublin's auxiliary Catholic bishops, and a  Unionist former mayor of Belfast,  John Carson.  Carson became friendly with  the then Lord Mayor of Dublin,  Fine Gael TD Fergus O'Brien,  and last year they went on a  joint tour of the United States.  Carson admits that O'Brien   opened up negotiations  for  him with the result that he met  Dr. Garret FitzGerald and the  then Minister for Justice, Jim  Mitchell.  James Eccles, until recently  Supreme Knight in Ireland of  the Knights of St. Columbanus,  says that, together with Denis  Maloney, also a Knight, and the  solicitor who defended Parkinson, he visited him in prison on  a number of occasions. Afterwards, they made representation  to the Minister for Justice.  At a press conference at UDA  headquarters in Belfast, Parkinson praised the humanitarian  policies of Fine Gael.  They  were the people who released  me, and I am very grateful,  he  said.  He added that he now regrets  having gone into the Free State  with the intention of doing damage. He had been treated well  in prison and those Catholics  and Protestants who had intervened to bring about his release  contrasted starkly with  certain  Loyalist politicians  whom he  didn't name.  He said that he would be remaining a member of the UDA.

        <pagetext>RecifooaL      V  The St Patrick's Day Parades  across America demonstrated  the growing support for the  struggle for Irish freedom. In  numerous cities this was shown  by naming Bobby Sands honorary  grand marshal.  The recent Newark parade  was no exception. Although Irish  Northern Aid and the Irish  National Caucus of New Jersey,  Inc. (as distinct from the  Washington-based Caucus) are  active and have a great deal of  support in the Newark area, the  parade leaders have consistently  taken a non-political stand This  year, however, Republican supporters showed their strength to  New Jersey  the Free State-loving officials.  Bridie Vesey from Rathmullen,  Co. Donegal, and her husband  Brendan from Ballaghadereen,  Co. Mayo, as Deputy Grand  Marshal and Assistant Adjutant  respectively, used their influence  to change the attitude of the  parade committee. As a result  of their efforts, when John  Brady of the Irish National  Caucus of New Jersey, Inc.,  made a motion to formally invite  Sean Sands and his family to  the parade, it was unanimously  approved. A big thanks to the  Vesey family for helping to put  the parade committee in the  right direction.  A little bit of Ireland took  over Hackensack last March  14th, as more than 2,500 ofthe  faithful marched in Bergen  County's first county wide St.  Patrick's Day parade. A bright  sun softened a stiff westerly  breeze that ripped at flags and  banners and chilled the estimated  8,000 spectators. The hour-long  parade followed 1  -mile route  down Main Street from Anderson Avenue to The Green,  opposite the courthouse. A  riderless horse honored Irish  Republican Army member  Bobby Sands and nine other  hunger strikers who died in a  North Ireland prison last year.  Sands was honorary grand marshal of the parade.  Bronx INA  The Bronx Unit of Irish  Northern Aid held a very successful social at the Broadstone Inn  last Friday evening. Sean Sands  held the audience captive and  will undoubtedly do so again at  the Riverdale Steakhouse, 259th  Street and Riverdale Avenue,  Bronx, Thursday evening,  March 25 th.  Irish music lovers will have a  double treat as Sean and Joe   Banjo  Burke contribute their  talent for the evening. There  will be a buffet, compliments of  proprietor Terry Connaughton.  Delaware Valley Chapters of INA  Presents  Philadelphia   The QE II  The Philadelphia City Administration apparently feels that Irish and Irish-       Americans haven't suffered enough...  Now our tax dollars are being spent to slap us in the face, by the  arrival of England's  pleasure  ship, the Queen Elizabeth II...  Demonstrate YOUR outrage   Sunday, April 25 th, 1982 at 1:00 P.M.  Packer   Delaware Avenues, Philadelphia, Pa.  For Information Call: 288-8298, 352-8148, 755-1069, (609)267-8098  The Delaware Valley Chapters of INA will demonstrate on  Sunday, April 25 th in protest  against the Philadelphia arrival  of the  Queen Elizabeth 2 ,  England's greatest shipbuilding  blunder since the  Titanic .  The protest starting at 1 p.m.,  at Packer and Delaware Ave. in  Philadelphia, will let the city  administration know that the  spending of tax dollars to welcome this carrier of England's  imperial flag is an outrage to  American citizens.  As Irish children continue to  be targets for British Army plastic-bullet gunmen, English foreign  office and economic bigwigs are  planning to impress the city that  is the cradle of hard-won American liberty. English accents and  a patronizing attitude toward   colonials  are all that the ill-  starred vessel has to offer, however. This is a ship that was outdated before its keel was laid.  Its turbines gave an embarrassing  black eye to British craftsmanship when they failed repeatedly  in trials. In service, at least two  serious breakdowns of machinery  and piping have left the hulk  wallowing dead in the sea, while  passengers took to boats or impatiently waited return of water  to bathrooms.  Aptly named, in view of the  dowdiness and lack of style of  its furnishings and accommodations,  Queen Elizabeth 2  is  seeking unwary cruise passengers  who will tolerate mutton in various disguises. Meanwhile, the  far superior food, accommodation,  service and attitude ofthe crews  of Dutch, Italian, Trench and  Scandinavian ships continue to  drain business from this  ship  of shame , as her own crew  took to calling her in disgust  some years ago.  Delaware Valley INA chapters ask support for the protest  Remember the Hunger Strike  Martyrs, and be present Sunday  afternoon. April 25th.

In many ways, America owes  a debt of gratitude to the sons of  Erin, for 50  of George Washington's rebel army was composed of Irishmen. The British  government has officially said  so. American army muster rolls  say so. And precious few of  these Irishmen were so-called   Scotch Irish .  If we are to believe the official  records ofthe British government  including parliamentary debates,  America was lost through the  Irish. A review of American  muster rolls records the fact  that Southern Irish names dominated. English General James  Robertson testified before a British parliamentary committee  that  half of the rebel army was  from Ireland . General Clinton  wrote his government in London,   the emigrants from Ireland were,  in general, to be looked upon as  our most serious antagonists .  After the war was over, Lord  Mountjoy exclaimed in the House  of Commons,  America was  lost by Irish emigrants     Ireland  had America detached from her  by force ofthe Irish emigrants.

Why would a man proclaiming  to be Irish refer to those of his  own ethnic background as  this  minority ??

We, the family of Patrick  America's Debt  were in part made up ofthe Irish  brigade under Walsh and Dilloa  US Army archives report the  facts. They list 221 Irishmen  named Burke, 327 O'Connors,  695 Kellys, 331 McCarthys,  494 Murphys, 322 Ryans,-266  Sullivans, 178 0'Neils,231 O'  Briens, 243 Connellys and 285  Reillys, just to mention a very  few Gaelic names. These are  hardly the names of  Scotch  Irish  soldiers. Irishmen fought  British tyranny at Bunker Hill,  including men with such Gaelic  names as Colonel Dan Moore,  Captain Thomas McLaughlin,  Privates Dan McGrath, John  Barrett, Thomas Collins, George  Shannon, John Dillon, Thomas  Doyle and Dan Callahan.  Gaelic was commonly spoken  by rebel troops. George Washington became a member ofthe  Friendly Sons of St. Patrick  since so many of his troops were  Irish. Irish soldiers in the British  regiments immediately deserted  to the rebels on reaching America. The first rebel Congress  included Irishmen named Sullivan, Fitzsimmons, Duane, Carrol, McHenry, Hartnett Kearney and Heney, just to name a  few. Irish rebel generals included  James Hogan, John Kelley, John  Dooley, John Shea, Hercules  Mooney, Steven Moylan, all  Irish-born.

The  great Shenandoah Valley was  called the  Irish  tract long  before the Revolutionary War.  fortified stupidity?  The Irish are as downtrodden  today as they were and that is  attested to by the pro-British  slanted reporting by the media  and the closing down of an  exhibit on Irish history by an  individual in the Customs Dept  who, at the behest of a minor  official of the British Information  Services, informed us that unless  Ireland changes its history, he  will not allow the public to see  it.  Maureen O'Driscoll  Hackett, as contributors to the  up-keep of such ministers in  their influential positions, hope  that relevent ministers of the  present government will now  press their British counterparts  to reciprocate a like humanitar-  anism as has been evinced in  the Littlejohns' and Parkinson  cases - a gesture that will achieve  a tangible improvement in our  brother's confinement.  Bridget Hackett  for the Hackett family,  Nenagh,  Co. Tipperary.  Approximately 200,000 Irishmen arrived in the American  colonies before the war started.  The famine emigration of the  1840s was actually the second  great flood of Irish immigrants.  The rebel army in Pennsylvania was called the  Irish Line   since it contained so many Irish  troops. Wexford-born John Barry  was called the Father of the  Rebel Navy.. Yes, there was a  small minority of Irishmen with  non-Gaelic names as well, but  they considered and called themselves Irishmen, not Scotch Irish.  They stood with solid patriots  like Wolfe Tone and McCracken,  Irishmen all.  Washington never referred to  the   Scotch Irish  as there were  none in those days. That term is  a recent invention. Ulstermen  contributed their proportionate  share in freeing America including the O'Dohertys, O'Neils,  O'Kellys, Maguires, etc., but  Southern Ireland supplied the  vast bulk of Washington's rebel  army. So much for the British-  created myth of the so-called   Scotch Irish .  Various Stormont governments  and the British government failed  to cite the fact that the families  of Presidents Grant, Wilson,  McKinley and others fled British  tyranny in the colonies. Their  English oppressors have, in recent years, enshrined the ancestral homes of the very people  they drove out of Ulster.  James C. Heaney  Buffalo, NY  To the Editor  On Thursday, March 11,1982  at about 9:15 p.m. (NY time),  the BBC broadcast a commentary  by one David Beresford called   Ulster Newsletter , apparently  a regular weekly feature. Mr.  Beresford was proclaiming from  Belfast the good news that the  people of  Northern Ireland   seemed to be coming to their  senses and at long last realizing  that  religion and politics don't  mix . The cause of this jubilation was the fact that the Rev.  Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party candidate in a Parliamentary by-election, Rev. William  McCrea, had run a poor third  -behind the second place candidate of the non-sectarian Alliance Party (David Cook) and  the winning candidate (with a  comfortable 5000 vote majority)  of the establishment Official  Unionist Party. This news was  celebrated as a step away from  the madness of sectarian politics back toward a more stable  and secular political life. But  what is the identity of this champion of non-sectarian, establishment common sense Unionism?  None other than the Rev. Martin  Smyth, the exalted Grandmaster  of the Orange Order   In his pamphlet The Battle  for Northern Ireland, the Rev.  Smyth, through some painfully  contorted reasoning,  proves   that it is the Catholics who have  terrorized the Protestants for  fifty years  Leon Uris (inIreland-  A Terrible Beauty, p. 183) calls  Martin Smyth  the real article,  a genuine uncomplex bigoL..mus-  cle-bound by his own medio  crity... . Maintaining the unmaintainable and rationalizing  the unrational, Rev. Smyth remains dedicated to the founding  principle of Orangeism: allegiance  to the Crown, upholding the  Protestant Ascendancy, and hatred of Catholics.  Mr. Beresford's delight it would  seem, is that the rough and redneck style of Paisleyite bigotry  has been forced to take a back  seat to the hoped-for and more  apparently respectable institutionalized discrimination ofthe   Gentlemen's Lodges .  The point is not whether or  not you accept the Irish Republican premise that it is the lesson  of history that the Irish nation  has made progress towards the  restoration of liberty and of national sovereignty in Ireland only  through physical force or the  threat of physical force. Nor is  the point the desirability ofthe  ultimate peaceful reunification  of Ireland. The point is that  whatever its good points, when  it comes to reporting on Ireland,  the BBC is mendaciously misstating the facts and is being  used plainly and simply as a  tool of English government propaganda in the very worst sense  of the term.  But then again, do we consult  Radio Moscow for the truth  about Poland? Where Ireland is  concerned it is the English who  are (as J. Edgar Hoover rightly  said of the Communists) the   Masters of Deceit .  Kenneth Tierney  Freedom for All Ireland Com.  AOH Westchester County     d  as  oo  o   lt; / gt;  H  X  m         lt;  GO  X  W  O  r  w      as   r  to    o  vo  oo  Senator Mathias  To the Editor:  Thank you for getting in touch  with me to express your concern  about S. 1639, the Extradition  . Act of 1981, which is currently  being considered by the Senate  Judiciary Committee. The bill  has been amended slightly and  reintroduced as S. 1940.  S. 1940 would replace our  outdated extradition law with a  codification of current case law  and practice in this area. The  bill would make one major change      it would authorize the Secretary of State, rather than the  courts, to decide whether the  offense for which extradition is  being sought is of a political  nature. If Congress adopts this  change, it will shift the determination of a  political offense   from a neutral, apolitical body  like the courts, to a proponent of  political policies in the Executive branch. This shift could  threaten long-established- norms  of due process and our long tradition of providing a refuge for  victims of political prosecution.  This proposed change has an  other potential disadvantage. To  place that decision with the Executive branch might force the  President to make judgments  that would cause embarrassment in his conduct of foreign  relations. Similar concerns  prompted us in 1976 to shift  from the Department of State to  the courts the decision on whether  or not to grant a foreign sovereign's request for immunity.  I will take a careful look at S.  1940 with these considerations  in mind, and will try to make  sure that it contains procedural  safeguards for the accused. In  fact I understand that the Administration itself is considering  amendments to S. 1940 that  would provide additional protection in this important area.  I appreciate your expression  of interest in the extradition bill.  You may be sure that I will have  your views in mind as the bill is  debated by the Committee and  the full Senate.  Charles McC.

James Wixted, a native of  Co. Limerick, was ordained for  the diocese of Portsmouth, England, where he labored as a  priest for forty years. Thirty  years of his priestly ministry  were spent in St. John Vianney  parish, Wantage, Oxfordshire,  a parish he founded in 1951. He  designed and helped build the  rectory and church towards which  the diocese had been able to  contribute only 500 pounds from  central funds. Like many other  Irish priests working in similar  areas, Fr. Wixted had relied on  family and friends in Ireland to  help financially. His own family  had contributed 10,000 pounds  and, during his thirty years in  the parish, he himself had not  drawn a formal salary. So far,  the Fr. James Wixted story is  typical of that of many Irish-  born priests and religious attached to dioceses in England,  Scotland and Wales.  In Memoriam  Fr. Wixted attracted national  attention by offering Masses for  the Price sisters when they were  being force fed while on hunger  strike, for the local MP Airey  Neave following his assassination and for Bobby Sands.  The Mass for Bobby Sands was  the subject of Mrs. Thatcher s  comment in the House of Commons:  This is a matter on  which a number of us feel very  deeply indeed, and why the feel  ings and thoughts of most of us  are with the victims of the Provisional IRA.  Tory MP Tom  Beynon complained to Fr. Wix-  ted's bishop, the Rt Rev. Anthony Emery, who is quoted  under the headline  Priest rapped  in row over Mass  in the Daily  Express of 5/11/81:  This can  be misinterpreted as condoning  what he has done. Any political  activity in connection with the  celebration of Mass is forbiddea   The summer after saying the  controversial Mass, Fr. Wixted  retired but returned to Wantage  after Bishop Emery issued a  statement saying that he had   honorably retired . This, Fr.  Wixted protested, was untrue.  He had, in fact, been forced into  early retirement because he had  offered a Mass for Bobby Sands.  The Irish Post (10/31/81) reports the events in the church in  Wantage following the statement  by Fr. Wixted:  Two male members of the congregation then  mounted the altar and attempted  to remove Fr. Wixted forcibly.  Two others intervened to protect  the priest and one ofthe assailants was heard to say: 'If you  don't get him out, I'll kill himV  The Irish Post reported also  that the diocese of Portsmouth  had conducted an internal inquiry  into Fr. Wixted's appeal against  early retirement Fr. Wixted  claimed the inquiry was incom-  Heirs: Mrs. Paisley, Ian Paisley and Peter Robinson  plete and was planning to meet  the Apostolic Delegate in London.  Hitler's Heirs  Actually, in one respect, Fr.  Wixted may have been lucky,  because he could have been  detained under the PT Act A  London-based nun     her name  is not given here for obvious  reasons     wrote recently in a  letter requesting the name and  address of some Senate members  in Albany:  Meanwhile, the Irish  in England are being treated  like German Jews under Hitler.  Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, Irish people are  hounded and humiliated, rushed  to gaol on the slightest pretext,  and can be kept for seven days...  Women especially are exposed  to obscenity and insult, having  no washing facility except a  public one where they are watched  by male warders. Could you  Irish-Americans pass on this  fact to the Vatican. You carry a  great deal of clout still.   The letter writer went on to  describe how the British Broadcasting Corporation portrayed  supporters of Irish Northern Aid  being interviewed in America  by BBC reporters:  In the program shows here, shots of Arma-  lite rifles and other weapons  were shown here and there in  conjunction with the text, thus  causing complete distortion of  the ideas presented.

The weather also had  a dampening effect on the viewers  But as I headed north on Madison  from 42nd Street, I remembered  a snatch of song:  // ain't no use to grumble  and complain  It's just as cheap and easy to  rejoice  When God sorts out the weather and sends rain,  Why, rain's my choice.  So with this refrain sliding around  my memory I turned up my  collar and tightened my hat as I  turned west on 45 th Street  Purloined Potables  The warnings that had been  issued by the Police Department about public intoxication  were a reality as I watched a  couple oftri-color bedecked kids  having their potables purloined  by the P.D. I proceeded west as  the two youths headed east,  summonses in hand. The weather  aside, it would be a dry day for  these guys. As I neared Fifth  Avenue I began to realize that  the contingent I was passing  was all Noraid. The expectations  of a good turnout were a fact  and another page in the history  o( the hunger strike was being  written.  Bobby Sands,  Honorary' Grand  Marshal  The election of Bobby Sands  as honorary Grand Marshal would  not be soon forgotten, by Republican supporters and Free Staters  alike. This was evidenced by  the politician from Sligo who  sat on the reviewing stand as  Noraid went by. After a few furtive glances he went into his  imitation of an ostrich and if his  need for fresh air hadn't been a  priority, he would have missed  the remainder of the parade.  Our upwardly mobile mayor  did his best sidewalk act decked  out in an Aran sweater and I  Love New York muffler. He  flashed the thumbs-up signal of  the ASUs to the cheering throng.  If he doesn't succeed to Hughie's  Albany job he would be a natural for the male lead in a revival  of  Abie's Irish Rose .  TV Coverage  The TV coverage of the parade by WPIX included the Norr  aid marchers without any comment from the usually gregarious  Jack McCartny. I gliess job  security in these troubled times  must be an employee's paramount concern. I hate to say it  but old Jack wears the halter  well. And while we're on the  subject ofthe parade's coverage,  how about a hand for the spon  sors, Bord Failure and Aer-  Libelous, It wouldn't have been  the same without them. Another  thought comes to mind while on  the subject of those tre-foil tailed  Tories, what with the disclosure  recently by The Irish People of  documents pertaining to the Free  State's attempts at denying the  American public access to spokespersons ofthe Irish Republican  movement and the continuing  harassment of Noraid by the  American government as they  insist that the rapidly growing  Irish-American organization comply with the Foreign Registration Act Can anyone who attended a picket anywhere in this  country during the last year or  gave a donation of any amount  to help with the humanitarian  work ofthe Committee, or even  purchased a T-shirt, poster, pin  or bumper stick'    . travel safely  to Ireland ever again? Consider  this, if Noraid is forced by the  Federal government to comply  with Foreign Registration, you  by your support ofthe demands  of the hunger strikers, through  your appearance at a picket  rally or demonstration which  was sponsored by the Committee, will find yourself in a tenuous  position on your next visit to the  Sham-State. It's no secret that  the representatives of the Free  State tried to persuade participating parade contingents not to  march on the 17th in any American city that honored the memory of Bobby Sands and his heroic  comrades. Of course, this is nothing new for the Ath Cliath quislings, as they have tried over the  last decade to dissuade Irish-  Americans from supporting the  Noraid Committee or any other  group of opponents of their support of British oppression and  the maintaining of the status  quo in occupied Ireland. You  can be sure that the rejection of  their overtures will not be forgotten, no matter what Charlie  fork-tongued during his D.C.  visit. They don't like people  who don't agree with their collaborationist policies, and you  must realize what happens to  people who don't agree with  them ai home. So before you  book your trip, give them a call.  They're in the.book, and find  out if they will give assurances  against any attempts by the Special Branch to harass you or  yours when you visit  that special place, Ireland .

        <pagetext>  BY SEAMUS BOYLE   DURING AN exhausting three-day  trip to Britain two weeks ago Owen  Carron, MP, visited five prisons where  Irish republican prisoners are incarcerated: Leicester, Albany, Parkhurst, Hull and Wakefield. Carron  arrived in Birmingham on Monday,  February 22nd, and was met at the  airport by Eddie Caughey of Birmingham Sinn Fein.  At Leicester jail Carron, after establishing his identity to prison officials, was taken  across a courtyard to the Special Security  Block (SSB), 'a prison within a prison', in  which, behind heavy security, were housed  six republicans. He met Brendan Dowd from  Tralee, who is serving life after his arrest in  Liverpool, and who has completed five  years.   Alt the time,  said Carron,  as well as  two Screws sitting taking notes there was  electronic surveillance... Brendan complained of the boredom and the political censorship of books. But they do get AP/RN. He  had wanted to get in the book 'The  Dynamite War' but the governor banned it.  When Brendan asked for it, he said he  couldn't allow it. He asked why not. 7 can't  allow people to take refresher courses in my  prison/ he said. Brendan replied: 'What  makes you think I've forgotten what's in my  head?'   Carron said that the prisoners spoke about  the political progress of Sinn Fein and urged  greater involvement in social and economic  issues. Pipe-smoking, Belfast man Brian  Keenan, serving eighteen years, made no  complaint about conditions, 'although repatriation would make visiting handier', and  was more concerned with the progress of the  war, as were all the prisoners. He sent his  regards to his wife Chrissie and asked for a  photograph of his grandchild. Carron also  met Eddie Butler from Castleconnell, County  timerick, one of the famous Balcombe  Street men.  TEA   One of the most amusing happenings of  this last visit was the arrival of tea for Eddie  and myself,  said Carron.  I suppose when  you're behind six electronic doors and can't  blow your nose without a camera looking at  you, it's easy to see why they can afford  tea.   At 3 a.m. the next day Carron and Eddie  Caughey travelled to Southampton and on  to the Isle of Wight, where Albany and  Parkhurst prisons are situated.   All Irish POWs are category 'A', high-  risk, explained a senior prison officer to me.  This is why visiting was so restricted, he said  in defence. The first POW I saw was Tony  Clarke, a tall athletic Belfast man, with five  years left to serve. Like all POWs he had  been moved around a lot. He was glad to see  me as were all the lads there. 'Everyone is  sound here,' he said. There were eight republicans and spirits were high. Repatriation  for 'lifers' was the main issue, he said. There  would be twenty to thirty out over the next  two years and only the 'lifers' left. Something would have to be done. He sent his  regards to his nephews, Michael Fitzsimmons  and Joe Clarke in H-Blocks, to Mickey Reilly  and Gerry Small in Wakefield and to his  sister. Belle Fitzsimmons, in Lenadoon.   James Bennett  from  Belfast  was the  i    next man to come in. He told me they were  strip-searched before and after visits. He had  been picked up in Southampton and he too  had done the rounds.   Roy Walsh from Belfast was a man in  high spirits even though he was in some pain  when I saw him. Roy, who was force-fed for  a time along with the Price sisters and Kelly  and Feeney, complained of a stomach ailment. The authorities, even though the  prison doctor had recommended X-ray treatment were refusing to bring him the necessary two hundred yards next door to Parkhurst to the X-ray machine. Such is typical  of the vindictiveness of the prison administration, and such revenge brought death to  Sean O'Connaill, through lack of medical  attention.   Stephen Blake from Donegal had just  arrived from Hull prison. His case is typical  of the hardship inflicted on POWs and relatives. Stephen has had no visits for three-  and-a-half years. Every time he has one  arranged he is moved to some other location.  Stephen's mother and brothers live in Letter-  kenny.   Jimmy Ashe from Birmingham will be  out in ten months. According  to some  female visitors he prides himself that he is  the best looking republican prisoner in jail    Ray  MacLaughlin,  a Birmingham res-  PRISONERS' MORALE IS HIGH SAYS CARRON  ON RETURN FROM ENGLISH JAILS' VISIT  mrHlnlHllun  lip theid niiifif firiif nun  lo ImmmMHtttmmu      Owen Carron on his recent visit to Irish POWs in English jails: 'The case for repatriation is clear.,  ident but originally from Buncrana, is a  happy-go-lucky bloke who nearly knocked  me down with a slap on the back when I  stood up to shake hands with him.  Repatriation was the main issue, he said.  There should be a full-time committee in  close contact with the prisoners. He sent his  love to his wife and kids in Birmingham and  his comrades in Wakefield and in Parkhurst.   Ronnie McCartney, a jubilant little  Belfast man, is the O/C of the republican  prisoners. He has served seven years and is  doing life. He has been moved around all the  jails     twenty-five times in fact. The men  are prepared to take a stand on repatriation.  They had tried to do their little bit to support the H-Block men. Many of the lads had  lost all their remission.   Noel Gibson is a quiet spoken but determined rnan from Portarlington, County  Laois. An uncle had been executed by the  Staters in the Civil War. He has served seven  years and hasn't had a visit since 1978. I  promised to call to his mother.   Owen saw a number of other prisoners  before visiting Hugh Callaghan, a man  wrongly convicted with six others for the  Birmingham bombs of 1974.   Hugh, finding it hard to cope, I'd say,  gave me a file on his case and remarked he  wasn't an IRA man. Nonetheless, he is a  victim of British racism and his case is  indeed a travesty of justice.  PARKHURST  That afternoon Owen visited Parkhurst.   Parkhurst is an old building, not like  Albany which was built in 1957. Parkhurst has, however, an SSB unit which holds  Harry Duggan, Joe O'Connell and Hugh  Doherty in the company of a Libyan and an  Iranian.   Again visiting conditions were restrictive, so much so that my first visitor, Harry  Duggan from Clare, confronted the Screws,  one of whom kept edging his chair closer to  us. Harry complained and an officer returned, but as usual there was this rule and that  rule. There was lots of aggravation, Harry  said, and they had to keep fighting for their  rights.   Harry had many reflections on the political scene at home and lots of comments  about the Southern election. He also thought  Sinn Fein had a lot of political work and  organisation to catch up on, the need to get  involved in the social and economic spheres.  Putting up Joe O'Connell was a mistake, he  believed. 'Joe's left Clare ten years now.  Surely Sinn Fein should be able to get a  better candidate'.   The next man to see me was Hugh  Doherty from Donegal. Bearded but with his  head shaved, he said he had to do something  with the electric shaver his mother sent him  and as he didn't want to shave his beard he  had to use it on whatever hair he had left   Hugh says AP/RN needs more political content and discussion.   In Parkhurst as the Screws slowed the  movement of prisoners up, I was only able  to see four POWs altogether. Two from the  SSB block and Gerry Young and Fr. Fell  from the ordinary wings.   HULL   On the Wednesday, I travelled up to  Hull where I saw Tony Madigan, John Mc  Cluskey from Fermanagh, Eddie O'Neill  from Coalisland, Stephen Nordone from  Dundalk and Dicky Glenho/mes from Belfast. Tony Madigan will be out in June, he  has lost sixteen months' remission and John  McC/uskey, two-and-a-half years. Repatriation and visiting conditions are the main  issues in Hull. Petty harassment is rife as  one would expect from National Front  supporters  in  the prison service.  Stephen  Nordone has had no visits for two-and-a-half  years as his family is harassed by police  when they are over. Dickie Glenho/mes also  saw this as a problem but his wife comes to  visit him.   Owen Carron says that seventy-four Brits  have been transferred to British jails for  offences committed in the six counties.  These include the two convicted of pitchfork murders in Fermanagh who are now in  Wakefield.  There are less Irisii prisoners so  why can't they be repatriated?  says Carron.   All the prisoners told me of Mick  Murray, on a blanket for four-and-a-half  years. John McC/uskey had to shout over to  him in the punishment block the night  before and he said he wanted to see me. He  thought he was being drugged. When I asked  to see him I was told he couldn't have  visits as he wouldn't wear a uniform. I  went to see the governor but he said there  was nothing he could do. I asked to go down  to the block     no, the Home Office wouldn't  allow it - need a special order, etc. And so  I left Hull without seeing Mick Murray but  knowing he's a sound man.   In the afternoon I went to Wakefield      Wakefield prison that claimed the life of  Frank Stagg. Brian MacLaughlin from Dungiven was the first I saw. He'll be out in  June. Mick Reilly, whose father is from  Ardoyne, has just seven months to do now.  Gerry Small from Be/fast will be out by  Christmas. In Wakefield I saw two other  innocent men: Patrick Armstrong from  Belfast doing thirty-five years and Patrick  Maguire to be released in 1985.   Patrick Maguire, one of the 'Guildford  Four', had his whole life ruined just because  British justice demanded its pound of flesh  and he, his wife and two sons were falsely  imprisoned -for incidents that IRA men  publicly claimed in court. Patrick Maguire  is coping well, he fjas Jpst his tivelihoodT  his freedom a nd Family, but not his spirit.   COURAGEOUS   I was soon to see how hard it can be for  IRA prisoners. I went to see Patrick Hackett  in the prison hospital. Pat is a remarkable  and courageous man. Minus an arm and a leg  due to a premature explosion on November  11th 1976, Pat Hackett is fighting still. He  has been on protest since January 1st 1979  for political status and repatriation. He is  locked in solitary confinement twenty-three-  and-a-half hours per day. He gets half-an-hour  exercise on a landing. He has a radio and  some books and gets some left-wing papers.  Pat told me about some of the bad treatment he has received. He was badly interrogated while recovering in St. Stephen's  Hospital, Fulham. Members of the Bomb  Squad beat him     a crippled man.  Pat too had many observations on the  political scene, says we need to be more  left-wing. Truly a remarkable man, he'll  never wear the uniform, he says, and he  wants a transfer to H-Block. Pat Hackett  deserves our support and it was indeed a  fitting conclusion to my tour to spend one-  and-a-half hours talking with him.   One other point is the colossal distances  between prisons which shows the physical  problem for relations going to see their  loved ones. The case for repatriation is clear.  The 1964 Instrument No. 388, Prison  Rule 31, guarantees it. The fact that it  doesn't apply to Irish POWs shows that  the Brits are motivated by racism and  revenge. Republicans who have been tempered and scarred by the prison struggle in  1981 must address themselves to the problem of our POWs in English jails and to their  repatriation.   Owen Carron who saw a total of thirty  prisoners has stilt to visit Gartree, Long  Lartin, Maidstone, Wormwood Scrubs and  the women republican prisoners in Durham,  and he hopes to do so in the near future.  as  no  H  X  ffl  i       a  c/ gt;  X  *v  m  O  r  tn  o  :r  to  CO  to

        <pagetext>ON        r    lt;N  x:  o  W  a,  O  w  a,  CO  2  w  H  oo   lt;U  60  C3  Shooter's  JANUARY 7th 1982 was the sixtieth anniversary of  the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922. This  so-called treaty divided Ireland down the middle, it turned  brother against brother, father against son and wife against  husband. The Free Staters called it 'the seeds of peace';  it was, in fact, England's divide and conquer policy designed  to get Irishmen at each other's throats.  For sixty years we have witnessed eternal war, bitterness, apathy  and the war in Ireland being carried  on, in the words of Lord Birkenhead, 'with an economy of English  lives'. The Treaty sowed the seeds  of civil war, jailings, executions,  hunger-strikes, emigration, 'cat and  mouse' policies, houndings, blacklists and terror of every description,  carried out in the name of law and  order.  In the old days, when the Anglo-  Normans first arrived, the Irish people  fell into three camps. The first camp  held the 'loyal' Irish; those who would  sell their own mother for a shilling, jumped  on the English bandwagon, crept with  cap in hand .ind cringed for land, property  and wealth.  Tho second camp held the 'rebel'  Irish; those who did not care where the  English robbed, raped and burned or  set up their pale, as long as it was not  on their property. They did not run to  the aid of the besieged people of Wexford,  Waterford or Dublin. Worse still, they came  with cap in hand to bow on bended knee  before England's King Henry II in Dublin's  College Green. Irish kings, princes and  church prelates kissed the hem of Henry's  gown and proclaimed him lord and master  of Ireland on condition that he allowed  them to hold on to their own titles and  lands.  The third camp hold what the English  doscribed as the 'wild' Irish. These were  the separatists, the people who refused  to accept Henry, the English or the annexation of Ireland into the foreign kingdom.  REMAINED  Down eight hundred and thirteen years,  the three  camps  romainod.   Even  in  the  days that they call 'the four glorious  years' (1917-21) the three camps remained  as they still remain today.  The 'loyal' Irish are all around us,  not just in the North but in the South as  well. The 'rebel' Irish are those who do  not care a straw as long as it does not cut  across their rich, petty lives. The 'wild'  Irish will never die; men and women  motivated by love, by ideals, by truth  and by justice will always shine far above  the self-seekers.  After the Battle of the Boyne, the big  question in Ireland was: 'Who are you for?  William or James?' Today the big question  in Ireland must be: 'Where do you stand?  For harp or for crown?' Those who wear  the crown above the harp on their caps  have chosen the crown's side     the side of  England. But there are others who do not  wear caps or uniforms and do not show  badges on their clothes but in their hearts  have crowns bigger than those in the  Tower of London.  Charles Dickens, in his book 'A Tale  of Two Cities', gives a good description   of Shooter's Hill. Sometimes I find it  hard to understand Dickens: the 'Tale  of Two Cities' is dedicated to Lord John  Russell who we remember as the famine  boss of England who allowed four million  of our people to starve to death or take  the coffin ships to America. He was the man  who gave the poor of England to the Poor  Law committees and those committees  drove thousands of Irish people out of  England and sent them back to Ireland to  die in the gutters of Dublin and theboreens  of the countryside.  TWO CITIES  My story on Shooter's Hill is also a  'tale of two cities': the city of Dublin and  the city of London.  The first time I put my foot on English  soil   was   in   the   early   fifties.   The   lion  THREE SHOUTS  ON A HILL  by Eamonn MacThomais  'SHOO TER 'S HIL L' is the eighth article  in the occasional series 'Three Shouts on  a Hill' by Eamonn Mac Thomais, in each  of which he recalls personal and historical memories associated with a different  hill and then gives three 'shouts' on any  subjects of his choice.  was roaring wildly. Threadneedle Street  was a hive of pin-stripe suits, bowler hats,  brief-cases and brollies. India House,  Lloyds', Barclay's, Scotland Yard, St.  James' Palace, Hyde Park and the Tower  of London. St. Paul's, Westminster, Regent  Street, Charing Cross and Wormwood  Scrubs. Boot-blacks, organ-grinders and the  horse-chestnut man at every corner. In the  side streets were a million huckster shops.  Turn a corner and out again to fashionable  Georgian houses with big motor cars outside every door.  As I walked around, gazing about, I  found myself outside the Home Office. I  stopped to think of bygone days. The  London  bobby  asked  me  if  I   was lost.   Yes,  I replied,  I'm lost. I'm looking  for two men, Arthur Griffiths and Austin  Stack. They passed by here in 1921.  Griffiths said to Stack: 'How would you  like to take home that building with you  Austin?'    What is it?' asked Austin. 'It's the  Home Office,' said Griffiths. 'Surely,'said  Stack, 'you're not thinking of anything  else except a republic?'  'Oh,'  said   Griffiths,   7  think   the  British terms are very good.'    'But how could we accept the British  king?' said Stack. 'Look at the dead  who have given their lives for the Irish  republic' 'Oh, I see. It's your conscience  that is the matter', said Griffiths.    When did you say your friends passed  by this way?  the London bobby asked  me.   July 1921,  I replied.  They passed  by this place twice, once together and  another time with Desmond FitzGerald.   The bobby looked me over very hard  and then decided l was joking and he said:   It would take a bit of shifting to lift  that building over to Ireland they'd need  more than a few hundred-ton cranes.    No , said I,  they moved it with a  gold fountain pen and royal blue Waterman's ink     the ink that doesn't fade,  or turn brown with age.   The bobby strolled on muttering to  himself about gold  fountain  pens, royal  blue Waterman's ink and ghosts of 1921.  I went into the Home Office and asked to  see the Roger Casement diaries. The men  in the pin-stripe suits were very nice and  civil but they were not sure if the diaries  were there or over in Whitehall. I waited  in vain.   Awfully sorry, sir, leave your name  and address and we will contact you in  due course.   I never did get to see the Casement  dia-ies yet I tried on at least four occasions.  But Michael Collins saw them and he agreed  with the British that the diaries were in  Casement's handwriting. These were the  diaries that the English had forged to send  Sir Roger Casement to the gallows. The  diaries are locked away now, not to be  seen until the year 2016.  The last deal was:  Here's the quicklime dust for Casement's body. Bury him  in Dublin and not in Murlough Bay   (Casement's request),  and shut your  mouths  about   the  diaries.    Mackey   is  dead, Nolan is dead, who now will become  Roger Casement's champion?  I came out of the Home Office and made  my way to Hans Place and Cadogan Gardens      the two places where the English first  made their divisive tactics. One half of the  Irish delegation was put in Hans Place and  the other half was put in Cadogan Gardens.  Both out of touch with each other. Why  not a hotel for the entire delegation?  No. The English plan was well thought out.  The next move was to split up Collins  and Griffith. ' Come with me Mr. Collins,  down to Sir Victor Sasoon's beautiful  home for the weekend.' 'Come with me,  Mr. Griffith down to my house at  Chequers/  Off they went to be wined and dined  and fooled and brow-beaten and brainwashed in evening dress, with solid silver  knives and forks and white linen tablecloths, duck, salmon, roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, Napoleon brandy and  music. A long, long way from the day that  Collins grabbed the coat of the 'Daily  Mail' reporter and told him that his paper  had called Collins a murderer.  The stage was now set for the final  act. All the props were brought into  position. First, the Pope in Rome; then  the insult to the king of England; then  the crown; then the North, then the  Orangemen; then the battleships; then  the terror; then the threats of 'terrible  war', then the letter to Craig; the phone-call  to the admirals at Holyhead. Sign, sign,  sign, sign, sign. The gold fountain pen  and the bowl of royal blue Waterman's  ink.  PROPS  The stage was set in Dublin also. The  props were out. The Dante celebrations;  peace; home from being on the run;  secret training; Croke Park picture-taking;  all united together, all as one; Larkin's  code     each for all and all for each.  It was a solemn moment as the gold  fountain pen was filled with the royal  blue Waterman's ink. The script for eternal  war was ready, the red blotting paper  under the first line. Two lines of men,  two cities     Dublin and London; two  peoples     Irish and English. One treaty      England's divide and conquer policy.  'Sign now, gentlemen'.  When the signing was over, Collins  spoke the first words:  Gentlemen, I have  signed my own death warrant.   Oh, if only Collins had remained in the  same frame of mind that he was in the day  he was going to sock the man from the  'Daily Mail'. Oh, if only the delegation  had not allowed itself to be divided. Why  didn't the entire republican cabinet go  over to London? Why did they accept  what they had previously rejected, in  July? Or was it more than the July offer?  Lloyd George had convinced Collins  that the unionists would have only two  and three-quarter counties.  Just imagine,   said Lloyd George,  Craig will be the prime  minister of the two and three-quarters  counties     the joke of the political world.   Collins signed thinking that the Boundary    Commission    would    give   Tyrone,.  Fermanagh, and parts of Derry and Armagh  to the Free State.  SIX COUNTIES  When the Boundary Commission was set  up the unionists wanted to take the whole  province of Ulster     Cavan, Monaghan  and Donegal were to be added to the other  six counties. The Boundary Commission  broke up in a big row over the border-line.  Then the unionists did their homework.  'If we take the nine counties the nationalists will have the majority. Let's make a  new border-line taking in the six counties  and with a good gerrymander system we      will reign forever.'  It wasn't until 1925 that the new agree-      MICHAEL COLLINS   ARTHUR GRIFFITH  wined, dined and brainwashed  ment was signed in England by Cosgrave,  Higgins and Blythe and the entire six  counties were handed over to Britain and  the unionists lock, stock and barrel. This  agreement, which also included the paying  of Free State money as compensation for  the burnings by the British Black arid  Tans was called, by Cosgrave, 'the seeds  of peace'.  The injustice of the whole affair, from  the signing of the so-called treaty to the  last financial agreement in 1926, and then  the betrayal by de Valera in 1927, was  enough to drive some of our best sons  and daughters across the waters into  exile in America and Canada. Those  who did not leave of their own free will  were driven out by the 'cat and mouse'  policy and by coercion acts.  Whoever goes to America to preach,  whether it's Mr. Paisley or Mrs. Paisley  or whether it's Mr. Donlon, Mr. Hume or  Mr. Taylor, they all must remember  that the Irish-Americans, on the whole,  are made up of the men and women,  the sons and daughters, and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the  coffin ships of famine times; the descen  dants of the Fenians; the descendants of  the Easter Week 1916 people; the descendants of Black and Tan Ireland; and the  descendants of the republican side ofthe  Civil War.  JOY  My first shout on Shooter's Hill is one  of joy that the federal policy has been  dropped by Sinn Fein. Did the unionists  not try the idea of the nine-county parliament for themselves in 1922, but quickly  saw it did not suit them and dropped it  like a hot potato? What they did not  accept in 1922 they are not going to  accept in 1982.  The enemy is the enemy of old      the British government and their crown  forces in Ireland. When they withdraw,  the differences between Protestants,  Catholics, unionists, nationalists and republicans can only be solved in the realities  of a united Ireland.  My second shout on Shooter's Hill is  to Margaret Thatcher. The British press  and the BBC showed us your tears and told  us that you were a mother first when your  son was lost in the desert. Six days of  tears you had, Mrs. Thatcher, and then  your son came home.  During your hours of tears did you  think for one moment of the Irish mothers  whose sons died on hunger-strike in the  H-Blocks? Mothers whose sons would never  come home again.  My third shout on Shooter's Hill is  to republican prisoners everywhere. My  shout is a shout of hope. You are not  alone in your cell, there are thousands  across the world who, each day, in their  minds are with you and beside you, in  spirit, prayers, hopes and wishes. Maybe  they don't all write letters or send cards  but they are still out here taking pride  in your courage and your sacrifice.  In the old days, in the Curragh concentration camp, we got letters and cards  from people who adopted us prisoners.  I remember being adopted by three schoolgirls. Helen in San Francisco, Colleen in  New York, and Harriet in Boston.  They told me that the schoolteacher  had put our names on the blackboard and  each pupil was told to pick a name. And  my three 'motts', as I called them, sent  me the most beautiful cards which I  proudly pinned up over my bed. Whenever I was down in the dumps I used to  look at my cards and the feeling that  someone cared lifted me higher than the  barbed wire.  Why don't you, dear reader, 'adopt'  a prisoner? Send a letter or a postcard.  If you are a schoolteacher, why not get  a class to pick a prisoner? A glossy postcard can turn a bleak cell wall into an  art gallery.  Tl  to  VO  H  X  w   gt;    lt;  2  00  X  *0  W  O  *0  r  w  o  cr  to  -j  VO  OO  to     INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY, which occurred last Monday, March  8th, was again highlighted by a series of activities organised over the weekend by anti-imperialist women in Belfast, Armagh and Dublin, focusing on  the situation of the women political prisoners in Armagh jail.  Traditionally, International Woman's     contributions   to    the       BERNADETTE McALISKEY  Day is a day on which women throughout the world join together to comm-  ommorate and celebrate their participation in tho struggles against oppression. In  the North, until recontly, the organised  women's movement has ignored the  crucial question of women's contribution to the struggle against the British  presence, but last weekend as in the  lost   three   years delegations   from  support groups and feminist organisat  ions in Britain converged along with anti-  Imperialist contingents from Belfast and  Dublin to picket Armagh jail, as a suit  able climax to u weekend spent reflecting the reality of the daily struggles of  nationalist women in occupied Ireland.  Last Saturday, March 6th, a photographic exhibition was held m the  Felons' Club in Andersonstown, in  west Belfast, which concentrated on the  daily lives and struggles of Irish women,  in ordinary life and in the armed  struggle. Comprising photographs, documents, posters, letters, profiles and  poems, the exhibition examined women's  to the community,  playgroups, mother and toddler groups,  tenants' associations, etc.; as well  as women in armed struggle, women  political activists, and women Volunteers who have died on active service.      GRETA REEL  received a bouquet from a Volunteer  The exhibition illustrated the tremendous progress achieved by women in  the North, especially since 1969, in  organising themselves in opposition to  British rule, thus breaking down sexist  barriers and advancing their own emancipation.  At a similar photographic exhibition  the same day, held in Trinity College,  Dublin, over one hundred women  attended the display entitled  Binlids and  Barricades'. Organised by Sinn Fein's  women's affairs department, the display  comprised sixty-four panels of photographs, text and posters illustrating the  role Irish women have played in the last  twelve years.  FUNCTION  On Saturday evening in west Belfast,  at a function held in the St. James'  community centre for the feminist  delegates from Britain, a woman IRA  Volunteer (one of several armed Volunteers present) read out a statement,  which said in part:   We, the Volunteers of Oglaigh na  hEireann. extend solidarity greetings to  women   involved in liberation struggles  throughout the world    We will ensure  that when victory is ours, and it will be,  that the women of Ireland will receive  full and equal recognition in all aspects  of Irish life.   There are no avenues of advancement closed to women within the Irish  Republican Army. We receive full and  equal recognition. Any promotion in the  ranks of this army will be gained by  individual effort and courage. We ask  nothing more and will accept nothing  less. Petty prejudices and sexism are  luxuries that we in the IRA cannot  afford, nor do we want.   Another Volunteer made a presentation of a bouquet of flowers to Greta  Reel, whose eightieth birthday occurred  last week, and who remains a dedicated  and active member of the Beechmount  Sinn Fein cumann.  PICKET  The following day, the picket of  Armagh jail by busloads of supporters  travelling from Belfast and Dublin  became the focus of the weekend's  activities.  As in previous years, scores of RUC  men cordoned off the main entrances to  the jail, but, unperturbed and in high  spirits, the crowd listened as solidarity  messages were read out from support  groups abroad.  Several   poems   written   by   Armagh  protestors were read out, and then a  statement was read by Maria Mc  Clenaghan, from Ardoyne in north  Belfast     recently released from Armagh  after five years as a protest prisoner. She  described the prison authorities'  constant petty harassment of the women  prisoners, and called for continued support until the five demands are  achieved.  Bernadette McAliskey attacked the  mainstream women's movement in Ireland for its continuing reactionary attitude to the Armagh prisoners, which in  turn aided and abetted British policy on  Ireland. Adding that it was these prison  ers who were the true champions of  women's rights     not those who adorned the polite tea parties of the women's  political associations     she said:  We  owe the prisoners an assurance that this  struggle and the women's struggle will be  further on when they walk out of  Armagh. Victory must be theirs, not  a victory which their grandchildren must  fight for.   The enthusiastic crowd dispersed  after chanting out the name of each  protesting prisoner, in deafening shouts  that penetrated the grim, grey wall* of  Armagh jail. International : Women's  Day has been fittingly commemorated  once again.

        <pagetext>*.,  EritOi  You are now ready to make a classic entry into, the  Irish language, by way of an important verb: Ta(taw*).   Ta  serves to tell where something is or what its  condition is, and therefore it has some ofthe functions  of English  is .  For the (i) sound, put the front part of your tongue up  along the top of your mouth, with the tip against the  upper front teeth and almost- but not quite- protruding  between the teeth. Pronounce the (t) sound a few times.  If you extend the tongue too far between the teeth, you  will say the (th), a sound which Irish does not have.  For the (aw*) sound, say the word   tof' but start the  word with the Irish (t) you have just learned Repeat  several times, then drop the final  t*' and lengthen the  (aw*) sound. As a check, try making the (aw*) sound in  another way: say English   awful  several times slowly,  and notice that your lips are pushed far out Try the  word with your lips, held in closer and more rounded.  You may recognize the sound as the way some Irish  pronounce  awful .  Now learn these words, referring back to Lesson 1  pronunciation guide as necessary.  ta se (TAW* shay*) he is, it is  Practice on these: deil (del), dean (day*n), dliis  t   me (TAW* may*) I am  fuar (FOO-uhr) cold  m6r (mohr) big  te (te) hot  6g (ohg) young  sean (shan) old  Ian (law*n) full  Next learn these sentences, then translate them. Form  a mental picture for each:  Tase'fuar. Ta'me'mo'r. Talsfog. T se lim. Ta'se'te. Ta  sfsean.  Learn these new words thoroughly:  fear (far) man, a man  cat (kaht) cat, a cat  bean (ban), woman, a woman  caihn (kah-leen), girl, a girl  bord (bohrd), table, a table  bosca (BOHSK-uh), box, a box  sr lt;ud (sra*d) street a street  agus (AH-guhs) and  laidir (LAW*-dir) strong  ard (ahrd) high, tall  gairid (GAH-rid) short  anseo (un- SHUH) here  ansin (un-SHIN) there  fada (FAH-duh) long  fseal (EE-shuhl) low, short  tanai (TAH-nee) thin  ramhar (ROU-wuhr) fat  cam (koum) crooked  We can substitute these into the basic sentence  Ta se'  fuar , he is cold, to make new sentences:  Ta fear anseo (taw* FAR un-SHUH). A man is here.  TaSean anseo (taw* SHAW*N un-SHUH). John is  here. TjTbean agus fear ansin (taw* BAN AH-guhs  FAR un-SHIN). A woman and man are there. Ta Brid  l dir (taw* BREED LAW*-dir) Bridget is strong   Tii  is irregular, one of only ten or eleven Irish  verb.s that are. For the negative of  tii , the basic word  is  nil  (neel). Read these:  Nil se* m6V (NEEL shay* mor) He is not big. Nil me  fuar (NEEL may* FOO-uhr) I am not cold Nil Sean  ramhar (neel SHAW*N ROU-wuhr). John is not fat  For questioning with  t-a , the basic group is  an  bhfuiT (un VWDL). In the West this may be pronounced  (un WIL). Read these:  An bhfuil fear ansin? (un vwil FAR un-SHIN) Is a man  there? AN bhfuil Nora og? (un vwil NOH ruh ohg) Is  Nora young? An bhfuil bosca anseo (un vwil BOHSK-  uh un SHUH) Is there a box here?  PRONUNCIATION  Irish t and d;- every Irish consonant has two different  sounds. The one selected depends on what kind of  vowel is next to the consonant The vowels  a ,  o ,  and  u  are called broad and give the broad sound to  the consonants next to them. The slender vowels are   e ,  i ,  ea , and often  ai .  You learned how to pronounce broad  t  above, in  the word  ta . Pronounce broad  d  with the front part  ofthe tongue in the same position, along the roof of the  mouth, with the tongue tip almost protruding between  the teeth. Try. dli(daw*), do(doh), dun(doon), drom   (drohm), dl(T(dloo), dath (dah).  For slender d and t, place the tongue tip, and only the  tip, on the hard ridge just behind the upper front teeth.  Then pronounce the  t  or d . (In the West there is a  tendency to pronounce these by sliding the. tongue off  the ridge, giving sounds closer to ch and j).  practice on these: deil (del), dean (day*n), dilis.  (DEE-lish), din (din), deacair(DAK-uhr),dlf(dlee),  te (te), teann (TAY*uhn) timire (TEEM-i-re), teas  (tas).  CONVERSATION  Read this carefully until you can go from one  language to the other quickly, phrase by phrase and  sentence by sentence. Do not try to understand the  grammar of the words or phrases yet Pay special  attention to  duit . This is generally pronounced with a  (g) sound at the start, and we will do that in this lesson.  The lettei u  in the word merely tells you that the  d   or  g  gets the broad sound The  t  must get a slender  sound  Sfamus (SHAY  -muhs): Dia duit a Ntira. (DEE-uh  git, uh NOH-ruh) Hello, Nora.  Nora: Dia's Muire duit, a Sheamais (DE uhs MWIR-  uh HAY*mish).  Hello, James.  Se'amas: Conas ta tu? (KUN-uhs TAW* too)  How are you?  Nora: T*fmego maith, agus conas ta tiffeln? (TAW*  may* goh MAH, AH-guhs KUN-uhs TAW* too  fay*n)  / am well and how are you?  Seamas: Ta me'go maith, leis. (TAW* May* goh  MAH, lesh)  / am well,' too.  H  X  Pi  2  X  hd  Pi  O  r  o   r  bo  oo  to  Irish Sugar Company Has Record Losses  The Irish Sugar Company,  one of the Free State's largest  state-owned companies, has announced losses of   12 million  for the year ending last September. This could mean substantial job losses in addition to the  threatened closure of the sugar  processing plant at Tuam, Co.  Galway.  The company wants the government to lend it   75 million, but  with Aer Lingus, B I, Nitrigin  Iiireann, Irish Steel and CIE already in the queue of financially  troubled state concerns, the Sugar  Company is unlikely to get the  sort of money it says it needs.  The Tuam factory, which employs 500, was saved from closure last year only by a government subsidy of   2.5 million.  The government gave in to considerable pressure from TDs  from the West.  But now it looks as if the  writing is on the wall for Tuam  as the set of accounts just issued  by the company shows a plant  write-off of   1 million at the  factory.  Also at risk are the factories  in Mallow, Middleton, Thurles  and Limerick, operated by the  company's subsidiary, Erin Foods.  At one stage last year, the  Sugar Company had debts of    90 million and most of the  losses are being incurred in meeting interest charges on these  borrowings.  There is also every indication  that losses this year will be even  worse.  Program  A modernization program has,  during the past five years, cost    40 million. The company says  another   50 million are required  to bring its operations   into the  eighties .  But the company's chairman,  James Fitzpatrick, has stated  forcefully in his report that there  can't continue to be an underwriting of activities for social  reasons     meaning maintaining  jobs because politicians don't  want lay-offs in their constituencies.  JUDGEMENT RESERVED IN DUBLIN SUPREME COURT'S SECTION 31 HEARING  Censorship in the balance  B Y DAMIEN O'ROURKE  THE Dublin Supreme Court has reserved judgement in the appeal by the  Free State government against the decision of the High Court declaring  Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act unconstitutional and quashing a bah  imposed by the Coalition Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on party  political broadcasts on RTE by Sinn Fein.  The   Supreme   Court   appeal   ended      cast    would be  likely  to promote, or  on Thursday 4th March after a three-  day hearing and it could be some weeks  before a ruling is made.  Two days before voting in the twenty-  six county general election, Mr. Justice  O'Hanlon in the High Court, agreed to  an application by Sean Lynch, Sinn  Fein candidate in Longford/Westmeath  to quash the order. He ci i so on the  grounds that Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1961, as amended  by Section 16 of the Broadcasting  Authority (Amendment) Act 1976, under  which the order was issued, is unconstitutional.  Among arguments by the Free  State Attorney-General, Peter Sutherland,  in the Supreme Court was the contention  that Sinn Fein had not challenged in th   -  lower court the minister's expressed  opinion   that  the party  political broad-  incite to, crime, or would tend to undermine the authority of the state.   In particular the Coalition Minister  for Posts and Telegraphs, Patrick Cooney,  had expressed the view to the court  that Sinn Fein was committed to overthrowing the institutions of the state  by force, and this, he said, had not been  contested in any way.  He pointed out that Sinn Fein was  not a registered political party in the  twenty-six counties nor would it take  any seats in Leinster House as it did  not recognise that institution of the  state.  He argued that the constitution only  contained a general guarantee of freedom  of speech and did not guarantee anyone the right of access to radio or  television.'  During   the   Attorney-General's   sub  missions one of the Supreme Court  judges, Mr. Justice Henchy, raised a  technical point as to whether the matter  of constitutionality should have been  considered by the High Court in the  circumstances.  On behalf of Sinn Fein's Sean Lynch,  Sean MacBride, SC, stated that at no  time had the state alleged that Sean  Lynch was doing anything illegal nor  proposing anything illegal in his election  literature or proposed broadcast.  He said that the Broadcasting Acts  did not come within the category of  laws expressed to be for the purpose of  securing public safety and the preservation of the state in time of war. Therefore they could not be construed as  authorising a minister to deprive a citizen  of his constitutional rights to freedom  of speech. He added that the Minister  for Posts and Telegraphs had not even  attempted lt; to find out the contents  of the Sinn Fein proposed broadcast  before he banned it.  He also submitted that Section 31  was unconstitutional on several grounds,  including    that    there   was   no   appeal  provided against a ban nor any procedural safeguards of ensuring that the  powers under the section were exercised  in accordance with the requirements  of constitutional justice.  Sean McBride said that the order  banning the party political broadcast  not only involved the constitutional  right to freedom of speech but also the  right to stand for election, which meant  access to the electorate and a right of  that electorate to be informed of what  the issues were in the election.  Two of the Supreme Court judges,  Mr. Justice Griffen and Mr. Justice  Hederman, referred to the speech of  Sinn Fein's Director of Publicity, Danny  Morrison, at the party's ard fheis last  October in which he referred to a ballot  paper in one hand and an Armalite  in the other, and they asked what that  might mean.  Patrick MacEntee, SC, who also  appeared for Sinn Fein, told the court  that the minister could not have formed  the opinion that Sinn Fein was an  integral part of the IRA; otherwise  steps would have been taken to suppress  the organisation.        SEAN MacBRIDE  'Section 31 is unconstitutional'

        <pagetext>00  ON  r-   lt;N  o  Sean Mac Diarmada (Mac Dermott)  By Proinsias 0 Cuilin  Part HI  The IRB decided to arm (a la    Carson's Ulster Volunteers) and    Sean became organizer for the  P lt; Irish Volunteers' resources. After  W the outbreak of World War I,    Sean led the Volunteer efforts  3S to avoid English conscription.  2 After a bitter battle of words,    public meetings, and combatting  ffi ofRedmondite rowdyism, Sean       finally triumphed over the forces  -H of conscription and Home Rule.   lt;L gt;  60  ca  P lt; Anyone who looks for the  details of this phenomenal man's  operation will be stymied, to  say the least Records are scant  because MacDiarmada, a walking memory, carried his notes,  information and name lists in  only one or two small notebooks.  Everything else was retained in  his remarkable memory.  DUBLIN DAYS  Such a meticulous man couldn't  have operated in a vacuum.  When one hears of his exploits  in field operations for Sinn Fein  and the IRB, one wonders: Did  he have a place to work? He had  an office in the building occupied  by Irish Freedom at 12 D'Olier  Street right in the heart of Dublin's newspaper area. This was  the third and last office for the  paper, the two previous being 7  Sinnott Place and 5 Findlater  Place. The moves were for reasons of expansion, plus an increased respectability in all republican circles.  He put in a long day (twelve  to fourteen hours), and broke to  eat only when the work was  finished. He performed all of his  work from these offices. His  friends were necessarily men in  the movement especially Frank  Fahy and Con Collins. He had  quarters in the same building as  the latter. Both of these men  were, like himself, very versatile  and belonged to many organizations. Although he had by this  time relieved Tom Clarke of  many ofthe executive functions  of the IRB, the two remained  steadfast friends.  And yet he remained socially  accessible. He frequented a popular coffee house on Westmoreland Street called Bewleys (Sean  abstained from alcohol) and enjoyed chatting with his female  companions in politics - he became engaged at this  time to Min Ryan. His regular  meals were generally eaten out  at the Redbank Restaurant on  D'Olier Street almost facing  the office across the street  TO REVOLUTION  Sean MacDiarmada was an  intriguing politician, totally secretive as to his intentions, plans  and the business of insurrection.  Not even his closest friends  could  read  him. He projected  a real social grace despite all  this secrecy, constant surveillance, and investigation by the  police and political foes. He  was also extremely strong-willed  and would either bend an organization to his will or start a new  one. This was one reason why  Sean moved from constitutional  Sinn Fein to the secret revolutionary IRB. He was in almost  complete control of the IRB by  1916 and, by manipulation, dominated the group that was to  determine the Easter Rising.  He was always well-groomed.  Mild-mannered, he could also  be stirred to vigorous dissent if  provoked.  GERMAN HELP  The plans for rebellion began  to take shape and form as the  Great War dawned in 1914.  Over in New York, contact had  been made with some famous  German figures of history: Franz  von Papen and Count von Bern-  storff, both emissaries of their  government Ireland would need  arms, and Germany was happy  to comply as long as these activ-  ities would bedevil England.  The shipment of weapons that  the Irish Volunteers received in  1914 in Howth, near Dublin,  wa-Uo be used during the Rising.  Sean MacDiarmada received  the shipment and supervised their  collection. The collection was  briefly interrupted by English  troops but Eamonn Ceannt in  charge of a guard party, opened  fire and engaged the force. These  prepare for a rising. Redmond  and his followers were for conscription.  Sean, by adept politicking and  not a little force, succeeded in  eliminating the Redmondite sympathizers from the IRB. In doing  so, he removed many old friends  and comrades, making a few  enemies in the process. By now,  he was in total control of the  weapons were all sequestered  with the aid of Joseph Plunkett,  Patrick Pearse and the indefatigable Fahy.  THE REDMONDITES  The march of events quickened  with the IRB/Redmondite conflict over the status of the Irish  Volunteers. John Redmond, trying to control the group, was  aided in the attempt by Eoin  MacNeill and Bulmer Hobson,  both founders ofthe Volunteers,  and opponents of an immediate  rising. The militants under Sean  wanted the Irish Volunteers to  continue resistance to conscription for the English army and to  IRB operation through the length  and breadth of Ireland. He controlled all IRB organizations  within and without Dublin.  Money was being received  weekly from America through  Clan Na Gael of New York.  These funds were carried aboard  ship by an IRB agent who delivered them to Sean MacDiarmada  at his Irish Freedom office. He  had intimate knowledge of every  dollar, pound or shilling spent  or received for the movement  At 12 D'Olier Street he was  accessible to the IRB, journalists,  agents  Volunteers or intellectuals. If he was needed at a  public speaking engagement he  was available. He sat on the  newly-created Military Council  of the IRB as political adviser.  Nothing of national value or  significance to the creation of  the Republic eluded this business-like revolutionary. He was  a pure professional.  TOWARDS 1916  The following year and early  1916 were tense periods for the  IRB. Events were moving staccato, one after another with irreversible momentum. There were  three main events now, in the  life of Sean MacDiarmada and  the revolutionaries.  He accompanied one of his  proteges, Liam Mellows, who  sponsored an Easter Week Rising  in Galway in conjunction with  the principal action in Dublin,  to County Galway, where an  anti-conscription rally was held  outdoors. The other scheduled  speakers were fearful ofthe police, who watched and waited for  every word or movement. Sean  became heated. He mounted a  brake and condemned conscription in unremitting terms. It  must in all fairness be stated  that pressure was getting to everyone involved in the coming insurrection. And Sean was above  all human.  He was arrested, remanded,  tried and convicted before a  Dublin military court, then sentenced to six months imprisonment. This was later remitted to  four months, but he was released  after two months. The organization was momentarily stunned,  then fearful Yet his organization  never suffered. It is a tribute to  this man that his organizing  finesse left men to fill the gap  opened by his imprisonment  Diarmuid Lynch of Cork took  over the temporary organizing  chores. He and Sean's other  confidants remained in close  contact with him while he was  imprisoned in Dublin.   To be continued)  Irish Names  O Brollachain  (O'Brallaghan, O'Brollaghan, O'Brollachan, Bradley)  This family's name is an interesting one because of the revealing lesson evident from the  widespread change to an entirely  different version, in addition to  the usual anglicization under  misleading spelling conventions.  In addition to this, the family  differs from others through its  establishment of a flourishing  branch at a distant location in  Ireland.  The ancient genealogies of  the Heremon line in Ireland  trace the family in Tir Eoghain  (Tyrone) from a man named   Brollach , in the line of succession of the O Fahy family,  which was descended from a  brother of an O Neill chief who  lived around 500 AD. The origin  ofthe personal name  Brollach   is not certain. It is true that the  word means breast but this may  not have been significant to the  original bearer of the name, any  more than a present-day   Una   would be expected to have a  sheepish look.  The O Brollachain family was  a branch of the Cineal Eoghain  in Tyrone, but in later days a  number of the family moved to  Cork, where they are now listed  as Bradleys.  The family included many  distinguished persons in the 11 th  and 12th centuries. For example,  Maolbhride O Brollachain was  a famous builder in the latter  10th and early 11th century.  One son, Aodh, was a professor,  and another the bijshop of Cill  Dara(Kildare). Donall O Brollachain, who died in 1202, was  the abbot of Derry, and Flaich-  bheartach 6 Brollachain, who  died in 1175, rebuilt the cathedral at Derry in 1164, getting it  into good condition for the Norman aggressors and plunderers  who were to appear in a few  years.  Although 0 Dubhagalns valuable 14th-century work, in part  on Irish families, did not mention the O Brollachain family,  the Annals ofthe Four Masters  (early 17th century) did, and  Donegal records in 1659 carried  many  O'Brollaghan  listings  for northwest Ulster.  The family suffered heavily  from land theft and oppression  at the hands ofthe English and  English-imported plunderers in  the 17th century, and it was  then and later that the- remarkable change in name occurred.  In ordinary medium-quality  anglicization of the name, the  spelling would become  O'Brot  achan , complete with illogical  apostrophe, illogical because it  signifies no omission of letter or  sound.  Later anglicization made the  usual error of replacing  ach ,  pronounced as a modern German would, with the poorly-  chosen and erroneous  agh ,  giving  O'Brallaghan , in which  the first  a  is an attempt to  represent Irish pronunciation for  the  o  in  Brollachain . The   O'Brallaghan  form is most  common in Deny. Today's American reader will tend to neglect  the  gh  and say  oh brall-uh-  han , a poor imitation of the  true name.  Many of the family did not  retain even this much, however.  Instead, they took or usually  were given the English name   Bradley , a name that English  bailiffs, land courts, and officials  thought was close enough to the  original and would help civilize  the  wilde Irish  sept.  The result is that today probably most of the Bradleys in  Treland are actually heirs to the  name  O Brollachain , and live  in Derry, Tyrone, Donegal and  Cork. English Bradleys are few  in number and easily indentifiable  in Ireland, so confusion in tracing  lineage by the Irish  Bradley   should be insignificant  Let each hope that the name  will be restored, so that  O  Brollachain  will be part of a  nation once again.

        <pagetext> JC  Danny Cm  ZJQf  During the Penal Days, the  laws that were in operation debarred Catholics from Parliament,  any government office - high or  low - from entering the legal  profession, and from holding  commissions in the armed forces.  This was done by enforcing oaths  for all these professions which i  no Catholic could take - oaths  such as the following:  I do solemnly and sincerely  in the presence of God,  profess, testify and declare,  that I do believe, that in  the sacrament ofthe Lord's  Supper there is not any  transubstantiation of the  elements of bread and wine  into the body and blood of  Christ, at or after the consecration thereof by any person whatsoever and that  the invocation, 6r adoration     ofthe virgin Mary, or any  other saint, and the sacrifice  of the Mass, as they are  now used in the church of  Rome, are superstitious and  idolatrous...  These oaths practically closed  all paths of advancement to Catholics in public life. To encourage  among the Anglo-Irish ardor on  behalf of the law, the Anglo-  Irish Parliament in 1705 passed  a resolution  that the persecuting  of and informing against a Papist  is an t honourable service.  A  Catholic was forbidden to own  a horse of greater value than five  pounds. Standish O'Grady tells  the story of a Catholic gentleman  ofthe County Meath, who, having driven four bloodhorses into  the assize town, was there held  up by a Protestant and tendered  twenty pounds for his four valuable horses, whereupon he drew  out a pistol and shot the animals  dead. Ever after, he drove into  town behind six oxen - his mute  protest against  law .  Incidents  like this,  says O'Grady, aroused  and fed the indignation which  eventually compelled the annulment of the law.  Lecky writes:  The influence  of the code appeared, indeed,  omnipresent It blasted the prospect of the Catholic in all struggles  of active Hfe. It cast its shadows  over the inmost recesses of his  home. It darkened the very last  hour of his existence. No Catholic, as I have said, could be  guardian to a child; so the dying  person knew that his children  must past under the tutelage of  Protestants.   However, the Protestant Ascendancy could not feel safe while  Catholics owned any sizeable  proportion of landed property.  Even after the confiscations following the Williamite victory,  Catholics still retained about  14  ofthe land A system was  devised, by acts passed in 1704  and 1709, which made it illegal  for Catholics to buy land at all,  or to take leases for longer than  31 years, and which at the same  time brought so many pressures  and prohibitions to bear on Catholic landowners, that by 1778  scarcely 5  of Irish land was in  Catholic possession.   After Limerick,  writes  Edmund Burke in his Tracts -  that is, after the Irish had, by the  faith and honor of the British  Crown, been pledged protection  in their lives, liberties, and property -  there was not a single  right of nature or benefit of  society which had not been either  totally taken away, or considerably impaired   The historian Lecky admits  that it was more through rapacity  than fanaticism that the English  and Anglo-Irish so ferociously  oppressed., repressed, and robbed  the Irish Catholics of both their  moral and material rights. He  goes on to say that fear of the  conquered people ever again  taking rank with their conquerors  likewise inspired the persecutions.  His words are:  It was intended  to make them poor and to keep  them poor, to crush in them  every germ pf enterprise and  degrade them into a servile race  who could never hope to rise to  the level of their oppressor.   r 3  mum mm  THURSDAY 11th March marks the one hundred and twenty-  fifth anniversary of the birth in 1857 of Fenian revolutionary  Thomas J. Clarke, the first signatory of the 1916 Proclamation.  Thomas Clarke, was born in  Hurst Castle on the Isle-of-Wight,  where his father was stationed as a  sergeant in the British army. Both  his parents were Irish. Shortly after  his birth the family emigrated to  South Africa, where they spent eight  years, before returning to settle in  Dungannon, County Tyrone in  1865.  At the age of sixteen, Clarke and  another youth formed a nationalist  club in the town, out of which an  Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB)  circle was formed. In 1880 he  emigrated to the United States and  joined Clan na Gael, the American  wing ofthe IRB.  BOMBING  Three years later Thomas Clarke  recrossed the Atlantic, this time to  England, as part of a Clan na Gael  bombing team. Under the alias of  'Henry Wilson' he operated in  Liverpool, Birmingham and London  in the dynamite campaign against  public buildings and railway stations.  But, after only a short time in  England, Clarke was arrested, stood  trial at the Old Bailey charged with  treason-felony, and in June 1883,  at the age of twenty-six, was sentenced  to  penal servitude for life.  For the next fifteen and a half  years he was imprisoned, mainly in  Chatham prison, under conditions  of deliberate horror, designed, sometimes successfully, to destroy the  sanity of the 'special' Irish prisoners.  His   account   of  this   period   was  afterwards recorded in a series of  articles in the newspaper 'Irish  Freedom' and later expanded into a  booklet entitled 'Glimpses of an  Irish Felon's Prison Life'     one of  the classics of Irish republican prison  history.  In September 1898, Thomas  Clarke was freed and returned to  Ireland, but the following year again  returned to the United States, where  he married Kathleen Daly, and  continued his activities in Clan na  Gael. In 1903, the first issue of a  weekly newspaper, the 'Gaelic  American', appeared with John  Devoy as editor and Thomas Clarke  as assistant editor and manager. It  became an influential and widely-  read journal.  RE-ORGANISATION  In 1907, Thomas Clarke returned  to Ireland and set up a tobacconist  and newsagent's shop at 75a Great  Britain Street (now Parnell Street),  which became a centre of nationalist  activity. Clarke set about the reorganisation of the IRB, and in  1910, with Sean MacDiarmada  as manager, he published 'Irish  Freedom', a militant newspaper  which advocated the use of physical  force to win freedom for Ireland.  In July 1911, Clarke organised  the first national pilgrimage to the  grave of Wolfe Tone in Bodenstown,  County Kildare. Three years later,  on June 21st 1914, he delivered the  oration there himself and, a man of  few words, confined himself to a  warning that the time for speech-  making had passed and that the  urgent need was for drilling and  training in the use of arms.  In September 1914, after the  'Great War' had begun, Clarke and  the other members of the IRB's  Supreme Council took a formal  decision to organise an insurrection  in Ireland before the war ended. A  year later Clarke became a member  of the IRB's Military Council set  up    to    plan    that    undertaking.  RISING  The culmination of the IRB's  plans, and of the role of Thomas  Clarke as the link between the  Fenians and the Irish Republican  Army, came at Easter 1916. Clarke,  because of his recognised historic  role, was given the honour of being  the first signatory to the proclamation declaring the Irish Republic.  During the Easter Rising he  fought in the GPO, and, after the  surrender, he was court-martialled  on May 2nd and sentenced to death.  The following day, May 3rd  1916, . with Padraig Pearse and  Thomas MacDonagh, he was shot in  Kilmainham jail.  On Irisii  Will Hold A  Live Ceili  Every Saturday  9:  .M.

UDR  McConnell, his brother Eric,  and William McClelland were  given life imprisonment for the  Turnly killing and for killing  Rodney McCormick, a Catholic,  who was shot dead in front of  his wife in Larne in August  1980. A number of other UDA  men were given lenient sentences for their parts in various  sectarian attacks. One of these  men, 26-year-old Matthew Martin, was a sergeant in the UDR,  the British army's regiment for  Loyalists, when he bombed a  Catholic school in Ballyclare  and petrol bombed a house. He  received a mere five years' imprisonment after a 'plea for mercy' was made by a former Moderator of the Presbyterian church,  the Very Rev. Victor Lynas.  Despite a long and bloody  record of sectarian bombings,  North and South, and their involvement in the assassinations  of hundreds of Catholics, the  UDA remains an open, legal  organization in the six counties.

        <pagetext>Greenwood Lake  w  Ok  o  w  GO  s  w  a  Ou  Waiting for Beckett  Actor-director-playwright Jim  Sheridan, ofthe Abbey Theatre  and the Project Arts Centre in  Dublin, will appear at the Irish  Rebel Theatre for a limited engagement the last weekend in  March. Mr. Sheridan will perform  his original one-man show,  Waiting for Beckett,  adapted from  the writings of Samuel Beckett.  Jim Sheridan was only a few  years out of college when his  promising work at The Abbey  Theatre led to his joining the  Project Arts Centre as Theatre  Director in 1976 and to his  election as Chairman in 1977.  The Project Arts Centre is well  known and sometimes notorious in  Ireland for its quality and daring In  1977, Yeats'  On Baile's Strand   and  Purgatory,  one of the  many Project Arts Centre productions under Jim Sheridan's  direction, was taken as Ireland's  entry to the Edinburgh Festival.      Mr. Sheridan organized and managed the Project Theatre Company for its American tour of   Waiting for Godot  in 1980.  He also founded T. Company, a  Dublin children's and street theatre group, directed Sean O'Caseys    Within the Gates  at the Lyric  Theatre in Belfast, and in 1980  returned to the Abbey to direct   The Blue Macushla  by Tom  Murphy.  Jim Sheridan is the author of   Waiting for Beckett,   The  Happy-Go-Likeable Man,    Mobile Homes,   Where All  Your Dreams Come True,   The  Halfpenny Place,  and  Inner  City - Outer Space.  In 1973,  he received the Macaulay Fellowship in Drama from the Arts  Council of Ireland, which had  been awarded only once previously: to Brian Friel in 1963.  Performances of  Waiting for  Beckett  will be held at the Irish  Rebel Theatre of An Claideamh  Soluis/The Irish Arts Center,  553 West 51st Street, on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, March  25th, 26th, and 27th at 8:00  p.m., and on Sunday, March  28th at 3:00 p.m. Tickets are   5; TDF vouchers accepted.  For reservations and information,  call (212) 757-3318 between 1  and 5 p.m. weekdays.  Irish Rebel Theater  The Irish Rebel Theater's  second production in 1982 will  be the American premiere of  Bernard FarrclPs comedy,  I  Do Not Like Thee, Dr. Fell.   Performances will begin Thursday,  April 8th, and run through Sunday,  April 25 th.   I Do Not Like Thee, Dr.  Fell  takes a satirical look at  that phenomenon of western society, the group encounter session.  Mr. Farrell's comedic style of  dialogue in this play has entertained audiences throughout Ireland  since Its world premiere at The  Peacock Theatre in Dublin in   In baseball, you get three  strikes, then you're out. Since  this is the State Legislature,  we've decided to spare the Governor from missing a third successive term. It's our ball and  we're waiting for the next governor.   Assemblywoman Florence Sullivan (R-C, Bay Ridge, Sunset  Park) said today that she is  postponing her campaign to create  a permanent day to honor the  memory of Commodore John  Barry, founder of the American  Navy and one of America's first  Irish-American patriots.   Since the Commodore was  a Navy man, we think he will  understand that we are sailing a  different tack,  Sullivan said.   On March 3rd, the State Assembly passed our resolution  asking the Governor to declare  September 13, 1982 as 'John  1979.  Variety called it  the best full-  length play by a new Irish playwright in a long time,  and the  Irish Times was quoted as saying   a devastating lampoon of one  ofthe modern western world's  most chic vogues.   Bernard Farrell's dramatic  career began in 1975 when his  one-act play  Goodbye Smiler,  It's Been Nice  was presented  at the Lantern Theatre in Dublin.  This was followed by  I Do Not  Like Thee, Dr. Fell,   Legs  Eleven,   Canaries,  and  All  in Favour Say No,  all at The  John Barry  Barry Day'. Next year, we'll  ask a new governor to sign our  bill making that date a state  observance as a permanent thing.   Governor Hugh Carey, bless  his Irish heart, won't get a third  chance to veto legislation supported by every Irish-American  organization in New York State  and possibly the nation,  Sullivan declared. State Senator  Hugh Farley of Schenectady is  Senate sponsor of the resolution  along with Senator Chris Mega  of Brooklyn.  Born in Wexford, Ireland,  John Barry was one ofthe new  nation's first patriots. His commission as Captain ofthe frigate  United States was the very first  naval commission in the USA.  The Irish-American Revolutionary War hero is regarded as  the founder of the US Navy.   Our country has heroes, but   1  Abbey. His television adaption of   Legs Eleven  is scheduled for  its premiere on Irish television  later this month.  Performances of  I Do Not  Like Thee, Dr. Fell  are scheduled  for Thursday through Saturday  evenings at 8:00 p.m and Sunday  afternoons at 3:00 p.m., April  8th through the 25 th. At the  Irish Arts Center, 553 West  51 st Street, in Manhattan. Tickets  are  5 and TDF vouchers will  be accepted.  For reservations and information,  call the Irish Arts Center at  757-3318.  today Commodore Barry is not  yet accorded the place that he  deserves in the creation of our  nation. He should have a niche  alongside the Hamiltons, Jones',  Washingtons and Franklins,   Assemblywoman Sullivan said.  Brooklyn's John Barry Club  is named for the Revolutionary  War hero.

        <pagetext>-J  O  w  CO  s  f    lt;  w  Oh  Gaelic Games: National Football League quarter-finals  Kerry put on pressure  to relieve boredom  KERRY    1-11  DERRY    0-5  IF SOME smart sponsor  were to put up an award for  the worst match of the year'  the second quarter-final of the  National Football League between Kerry and Derry at  Croke Park yesterday would  (be a strong (or is it weak?)  contender to carry off the  prize. It was a doleful affair,  unrelieved by any feature  approaching entertainment for  5,325 spectators until the last  five minutes, when Kerry  skipped through the Derry  defence to score six sparkling  points from play.  Before that shocking deviation  from the norm, which must have  been due to a collective brainstorm, there was solid ground for  suspicion that the All-Ireland  champions had been hijacked on  the way to Dublin and replaced in  the famous green and gold by a  team of novices.  One can only assume that  Kerry, with a (ar bigger prize in  the offing, are not prepared to  break their necks or burst their  guts to win the National League.  It the last five minutes are  excepted, it was almost by default  that they won yesterday     and  now they arc through to a semifinal meeting with Armagh, at  Croke i'.uk on April 11th.  DERRY'S LAPSE  For more than thrccquartcrs of  the hour, the game was there for  the taking by Derry but, while the  Ulster side was pretty strong in  defence and not lacking in industry around midfield, they were  short of ideas and power in attack,  where only Mickey Lynch and,  for a period of about 21) minutes,  s ubstitutc Lug e n c Y o u n g  threatened to take advantage of a  weakness in the Kerry hall-back  line.  There was no weakness at right-  half, however, for Paud O'Shea  was one of the few Kerry players  to perforin adequately and it was  he  who  opened  up  the  road   to  victory with two fine points from  dead-ball kicks, a 50 and a  55-yards free, in the 10th and 11th  minutes of the second half. Those  scores regained a lead which  Kerry had lost six minutes before  the interval.  If this game is to be remembered in days to come it will be  for one happening     the return of  Pat Spillane to the Kerry team for  the first time since his token  appearance at the close of the All-  Ireland final last September.  Spillane replaced Ambrose  O'Donovan eight minutes from the  end and sprinted around as if his  left knee had never been damaged.  His possession of the ball was  minimal, however, but he left an  imprint on the event with a typical  curling point from the right corner  just on the call of time.  Kerry lined out with 10 of their  All-Ireland team, the missing men  being John O'Keeffe, who was  released to be with the St  Brendan's (Killarney) team in the  Munster colleges' final; Paud  Lynch, Denis Moran, Mike  Sheehy and John Egan.  Vincent O'Connor, though not  overworked, deputised most capably for O'Keeffe in the full-back  position and John L. McElligott  again played well enough at right-  half forward to keep the selectors  wondering what they will do about  him when championship time  comes around.  Jim Denihan was called up to  play at right-full but was clearly  hampered by his hamstring injury  ami the midfielder. Jack O'Shea,  though he played with more heart  than most of his colleagues, was  also slowed down bv the let: injurv  he sustained in the tinal ot the  Railway Cup.  CLOSE MARKING  Ger Power, who had been  having a lean time of late,  flourished as a forager and carrier  when he moved from the right  corner to left half forward in the  second half and Eoin Liston won  a great deal of possession, both at  full-forward and centre forward,  but had several scoring attempts  blocked down by the alert Derry  backs.  Close marking was a feature of  Derry's defensive play and was  largely responsible for Kerry's  failure to score from play between  the third and 48th minutes.  John Sommers had a good game  in goal, his saves including two  McElligott shots from point-blank  range. The Trainor brothers and  Terry Moore formed a vigilant full  back line, while Gerry O'Loughlin  and Frankie Johnston, who  swapped wings in the half back  line, played very effectively until  the final quarter of an hour.  Mick Berryman, who replaced  James McGuckian at centre half  after the interval, also played  quite well for a while, but,  towards the end, the whole Derry  defence caved in as Kerry, at last,  released their latent scoring  power.  Liston scored Kerry's goal in  the third minute when he moved  through two defenders like a skier  racing through two of those posts  on a slalom run. Tommy Doyle,  from a free, put them 1-1 to 0-1 in  front in the 11th minute and then  Derry took up the running to level  the scores, 1-1 to 0-4, at half time.  Lynch, Damien Barton, Colm  McKee, with a kick as high as a  tower, and Young were Derry's  first-half scorers.  Kerry's passes landed in Derry  hands so often in the first half that  one wondered if most of the side  were afflicted by colour blindness.  Derry scored only once in the  second half, a point in the 43rd  minute from Eugene Donnelly.  Paud O'Shea, as stated, set Kerry  off with his big kicks from long  range and Power scored from play  in the 48th minute.  That was followed by a Tommy  Doyle point from a free, after  which McElligott (2), Liston,  Power, Tommy Doyle and Pat  Spillane knocked half a dozen  over tne oar io complete a iorget-  table game.  Tailpiece: The small crowd got poor value  for their money from the double bill (the  admission pnee to the Hogan Stand was   4)  and they could not be bbmed for complaining  that the public address system was not used  to inform them of the changes in Kerry's line-  out and the identity of substitutes during the  course of the game.

Offaly's Matt Connor gets  in his kick at goal despite  the close marking of Mark  Turley of Down in yesterday's National Football  League Quarter-final at  Croke Park.     Photograph: Tom Lawlor  GAA IN BRIEF  NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE  Quarter-finals     Offaly   1-9,   Down  0-12;  Kerry 1-11. Derry 0-5.  NATIONAL HURLING LEAGUE  Division Two     Wicklow  1-H.  Mayo 0-4;  Kildare   4-12.   Armagh   2-12;   Meath   4-12,  Roscommon 2-2.  Down's top  ks  HI  b  DOWN      0-12;  OFFALY     1-9  GREG BI ANEY. Down's  stylish centre forward contributed half of his team's score  in their drawn match with  Offaly in the National Football  League quarter-final at Croke  Park yesterday, but it will be  his extraordinary failures  which will be remembered. He  drove the ball wildly wide of  an open goal in the first half  and then was badly short with  a free kick which would have  decided the match just before  the end  But, if Down were prodigal with  their chances, Offaly were even  worse and their total of Id wides  in the course of the match is a sad  reflection on their players and  their failure to master the most  basic skill of the game.  Yet, it was the  quick eye and  sharp reflexes of Matt Connor  which gave them the goal which  kepi them in control of Tor most ol  the match. Connor was in like a  whippet    after   John    Guinan's  target at last moment  angled pass in the sixth minute to  deflect the ball past Pat Donnan  for the only goal of the game. Had  his colleagues and rivals been as  nimble and as inspired there  would have been a Hood of  scoring which would have put the  scoreboard into a spin.  Not that scoring would have  made much difference to the dull  atmosphere and rather halfhearted efforts of the players or  given the crowd of just over 5,000  any better value for their money.  The standard of football was never  much above the mediocre and it  was only the enthusiasm of the'  supporters -.if the Ulster teams  which gave  an air of competitiveness to the two games.  Down will be pleased enough  with the dtaw for they were  trailing throughout the match until  the 25th minute when Blaney  brought them level for the first  time. By that stage the centre  orward had suddenly discovered  his accurac) and that point was  his third in as man) minutes.  Had he been in similar, form in  the 12th minute, there might have  been a much different outcome.  With the Offaly defence in some  thing of a muddle and their goalkeeper Denis Wynne advancing  from his line in desperation,  Blaney, from no more than six  yards and with a yawning net in  front of him, drove the ball wide.  His team-mate, Damien Morgan,  followed up with two misses  which were almost as bad and  Blaney himself also shot wide  from a good chance as Down let  Offaly off the hook.  The Leinster champions had  started impressively and a good  shot from John Guinan was well  saved by Pat Donnan as they  pressed forward and. although  they also missed simple chances  of scores, they found themselves  ahead by l-l  in the sixth minute  both scores coming from Matt  Connor.  Paddy O'Rourke seorcd a  beautiful point for Down in the  seventh minute and Brendan  McGovern added another before  Blaney and Morgan missed those  simple chances. It was now  Offaly's turn but when Guinan and  Pat Fitzgerald tried tor goals  Donnan brought off a marvellous  double save to deny them.  Down had another chance soon  after this when John McCartan-  and Damien Morgan , swept  through the Offaly defence after  Ambrose Rodgers had again won  possession at midfield. Brendan  McGovern appeared at the end of  the move but blazed the ball over  the bar when a goal seemed a  more likely outcome.  When   Offaly  came   back  with  Points from Gerry Carroll and Pat  itzgerald to give Offaly a goal  lead Down seemed to be slipping  away but Blaney at last found the  range and Paddy O'Rourke dashed  through for another good point to  leave them only a point behind at  half time.  Offaly surged forward again at  the start of the second half and  Padraig Dunne and Brendan  Lowry widened the gap to three-  points again. Down  brought on  Liam Austin at this stage with  Ambrose Rodgers moving Into the  half forward line but Offalv continued to exert full control and  Matt Connor took a point from a  sideline free with a beautiful kick  to Give them a four-point lead.  Down refused to give up, however, and after lim McCartan and  Brendan Lowry had  exchanged  points, frees by Blaney and  Brendan McGovern revived  Down's morale. Gerry Carroll  pointed for Offaly but there followed Blaney's hat-trick of points  to bring the scores level. He  levelled again three minutes later  after Dunne had punched a Lowry  lob over the bar for Offaly.  SHORT TIME  There followed Blaney's  chance to win the game but he  struck his free from 40 yards with  the wind behind hkn short into the  goalmouth. It was cleared before  the referee. Kevin Campbell from  Meath. signalled a draw with half  a minute remaining on the stop  watch.  When the replay takes place on  April 4th, also in Croke Park,  much will depend on whether or  not the sides are capable of  making the most of their chances.  Yesterday, Down played some  neat incisive football from defence  through midfield but when the 40  yard mark was reached they  seemed to lose themselves, Their  midfielders Ambrose Rodgers and  Paddy O'Rourke can claim a lot of  the credit for the draw and Mark  Thurlcy, Mickey Sands and Ned  King in defence were in good  form.  The attack, however, needs a  lot of shooting practice and if this  aspect of their game can be put  right they might well reach the  semi-finals.  Offaly will also have learned a  lesson from the operation. Their  defence, too, was sound with  Michael Lowry, Liam Connor.  Charlie Conroy, and Stephen  Darby always willing to play  constructively but. unfortunately,  were it not for the opportunism of  Matt Connor in taking the goal  when the chance came, they might  not have lived to fight another  day.

        <pagetext>EASTER RISING  72ND ANNIVERSARY  1916     1988  1916  1916  POBLACHT NA H-EIREANN.  TEI PBOTISIOKAL GOmMDBJT  OP  THE  IRISH   REPUBLIC  n m mru or nium.  IRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN: In the name of God and of the dead generations from  which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children tov  her flag and strikes for her freedom. **    Having organised and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionary organisation, the  Irish Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military organisations, the Irish Volunteers  and the Irish Citizen Army, having patiently perfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for  the right moment to reveal itself, she now seizes that moment, and supported by her exiled children  in America and by gallant allies in Europe, but relying in the first on her own strength, she strikes  in full confidence of victory.  We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered  control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasable. The long usurpation of that right by a  foreign people and government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished  except by the destruction of the Irish people. In every generation the Irish people have asserted  their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the past three hundred years they  have asserted it in arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the  face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and  we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades-in-arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare,  and of its exaltation among the nations.   ' The Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims, the allegiance of every Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to  all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation  and all of its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally, and oblivious of the differences  carefully fostered by an alien Government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the  past  Until our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of a permanent  National Government, representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of  all her men and women, the Provisional Government, hereby constituted, will administer the civil  and military affairs of the Republic in trust for the people.  We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most High God, Whose  blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour  it'by cowardice, inhumanity, or rapine. In this supreme hour the Irish Nation must, by its valour    and discipline and the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good,  prove Itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.  Signed on behalf of the Provisional Government.  SPONSORED BY  RISH NORTHERN AID  San Francisco Unit   i

        <pagetext>EXECUTION  British Style  kiiiiuiiiinuin .urn C nun. a ni  1916  SPONSORED BY  Mary Wilson, Irish People  Mairead Farrell  1988  SPONSORED BY  COUNTY LEITRIM SOCIETY  Sean Mac Diarmada  Sean MacDermott  Sean Mac Diarmada (1886-1916) was born in  Kiltyclogher, County Leitrim. He emigrated to Glasgow at  the age of fifteen years. Returning to Belfast after a few  years, he was sworn into the IRB in 1908, and  transferred to Dublin, wh,ere he became a very close  personal friend of Tomas O Cleirigh. He was appointed  fulltime organizer for the IRB and Sinn Fein. In this  capacity he traveled extensively throughout the country. In 1912 he contracted polio and thereafter walked  only with the aid of a stick. He was a founder member of  the Irish Volunteers in 1913, and later became a member of the Military council and provisional government.  He fought in the General Post Office and was executed  in Kilmainham Jail on May 12th.  Like Sean Mac Diarmada, Leitrim native Brian (Barney) McKeon, has been subjected to British injustice in  the form of imprisonment. Convicted on a charge of  conspiracy, Barney originally faced nine charges ranging from conspiracy to gun running. It took three trials  (with Barney forced to function as his own attorney in  the final one) to put Barney behind bars on one flimsy  charge. Barney is back home again with the loyal family  who were unflinching in their support Barney McKeon, all  of Leitrim salutes you and your fine family

        <pagetext>c  B   3.  a,  3  CO  oo  00  Os  3  w  UJ  Ph  o  w  Ph  PC  00  VO  Oh  WOMEN OF 1916  UNWELCOME  PATRIOTS  Z gt;y Mary Holt Moore  The commandants of the various outposts of the Easter Rising reacted in different ways to  the urgings of the women to join  the insurgent forces. Many shared  the traditional Catholic view that  the women were only to serve in  an auxiliary capacity, viz., first  aid stations and cooking. The  women of Cumann na mBan had  spent the week prior to Easter  Sunday making up endless medical kits as a preparation for a  route march on Easter Sunday.  Many suspected that the march  would signal the beginning of a  rebellion.  When Eoin MacNeill ordered  the cancellation of all demonstrations and parades because  of the failed delivery of arms at  Tralee, everything was thrown  into confusion. The leadership  decided to overrule Mac Neill  and sent couriers throughout the  countryside. However, they did  not notify the women. Maire nic  Shiubhlaigh went to the Ceannt  home, where Aine Ceannt and  her sister, Lilly O'Brennan (both  executive members of Cumann  na mBan), told Maire to ignore  the countermanding order and  to prepare to meet them the next  day.  It was thanks to the heroic  work of the women couriers that  the Rising was saved from utter  confusion. Nora Connolly was  the first to become a courier.  She and Eilis ni Chorra brought  word of the chaotic state of affairs  to the Military Council in Dublin.  The women were given a copy  of the Proclamation to memorize  and sent back to the North  to inform all that the Rising had  begun and all preparations were  to continue as planned. Maire  Perolz was sent to Cork to reach  Tomas MacCurtain, Eily  O'Hanrahan went to Ennis-  corthy, Nancy Wyse Power to  Barris, and others to Tralee,  Waterford and Dundalk. Everything was in confusion.  Maire nic Shiubhlaigh and six  women went to Jacob's Biscuit  Factory when she convinced  Thomas MacDonagh of the essential role of women; Eilis ni  Riain reported to Palmerston  Place.  Courts refused to go home. Pearse,  Connolly, and Clarke, on hearing of the women's frustration,  sent out word to all units and the  women were installed at all  major outposts.  THE ONLY COMMANDANT TO STEADFASTLY  REFUSE THE WOMEN WAS  EAMON deVALERA IN  BOLAND'S MILL.  Helena Moloney and the  women of the Citizens' Army Ambulance Corps joined a contingent, ten men and nine women, and  launched an attack on Dublin  Castle. Helena was a good friend  of Sean Connolly. Dr. Kathleen  Lynn, Medical Officer, attended the dying Sean Connolly.  As the ranking officer, she surrendered the tiny garrison.  Countess de Markievicz and  fifteen women were at Stephen's  Green.  Madeline ffrench-Mullen supervised the first-aid post under  Michael Mallin.  Margaret Skinnider served as  sniper. She was a member of the  Glasgow Cumann na mBan and  was a crack shot at the Glasgow  Rifle Club. She was badly wounded while taking part in an attack  on a house behind the Russell  Hotel on the Green.  Margaretta Keogh was killed  in the South Dublin Union while  attempting to help a wounded  Volunteer.  Louise Gavan Duffy, G.P.O.,  was delegated to take the wounded to Jervis Street Hospital.  Twenty-six women were with  Eamon Ceannt's forces in the  Marrowbone Lane Distillery.  Con Colbert, one of the Fianna  Boys, was left in charge while  Ceannt was at the South Dublin  Unioa Rose McNamara, Officer-  in-Charge of the Cumann na  mBan, led the women to surrender. They were taken to Richmond Barracks and then to  Kilmainham jail.  Thirty-four women went originally to the GPO. Twenty were  persuaded to leave. Eleven helped  to evacuate the wounded. Three  women stayed behind Winifred  Carney, James Connolly's secretary, Elizabeth O'Farrell, who  carried the white flag of surrender, and Julia Grennan.  Irish Citizen Army Women  imprisoned: Brigid Foley and  Marie Perolz, released in June;  Nell Ryan in the autumn; Winifred  Carney and Helena Moloney,  Christmas, 1916. Countess  Marklievicz was courtmar-  tialled, condemned to death and  sent to Aylesbury.  Vol Josephine O'Bwyer in uniform  A MOTHER SPEAKS  Dear Mary, that didst see thy first-born Son  Go forth to die amid the scorn of men  For whom He died,  Receive my first-born son into thy arms,  Who also hath gone out to die far men,  And keep him by thee till I come to him.  Dear Mary, I have shared thy sdrrow,  And soon shall share thy joy.  P. H. PEARSE  tann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army who took part in the Faster Rising  NURSE  MARGARET KEOUGH  When the British opened fire  on the Volunteers in the South  Dublin Union, many of the convalescing patients were strolling  in the grounds. The nurse in  charge, Nurse Margaret Keogh,  became anxious for their safety.  She rushed down the stairs to  the exit of Building  6 and, on  opening the door, was fired on  by two British soldiers and fell  mortally wounded. This action  was uncalled for because they  ; could see her uniform.  Commandant Eamonn Ceannt  said that Nurse Keogh ws the  first martyr and asked the  Volunters to remember so. She  was buried in the hospital grounds,  but later her remains were transferred for reburial in Ballinab-  rannagh, Co. Carlow.

Constance Georgina Gore-Booth, the eldest daughter of  Sir Jocelyn and Lady Gore-Booth, of Lissadell, Co. Sligo, was born on February 4th, 1868, at  Buckingham Gate, close by the Royal Palace in London. Her father was a wealthy benevolent landlord, of Protestant Anglo-Irish stock. Having spent her youth at Lissadell, at the age of eighteen  she went to Paris to study art. There she met a Polish Count, Joseph Dunin Markievicz, whom  she married, at St. Marylebone's Parish Church, in London in 1900. Having settled in Dublin, she  met Padraic Pearse and Thomas MacDonagh, and became deeply involved in the national movement. She joined James Connolly's Citizen Army, and became known as  The Rebel Countess .  She founded Na Fianna Eireann, the national boy scout movement. In the Rising of 1916, she  was Vice-Commandant to Michael Mallin, in the College of Surgeons Garrison at St. Stephen's  Green. After the surrender she was sentenced to death. This was later commuted to penal servitude for life. She was released from Holloway Jail in the General Amnesty of 1917. She became  a Catholic the same year, and was baptized at Holy Cross College. Having been elected in the  General Election of 1918, she was appointed to the Ministry of Labour when Dail Eireann was  set up in January 1919. To the end of her life she devoted herself to the welfare of the Irish  people. She dispensed so much of her wealth to the poor of Dublin, that when she died in a  public ward of Sir Patrick Duns Hospital, she was virtually penniless. She breathed her last at  1.25 a.m. on the morning of July 15th, 1927, by her bedside * was her daughter Maeve. She  was laid in state in the Rotunda Cinema. The Free State Government had callously refused to  give the Mansion House. Around her bier for two days and nights, her own boys of Na Fianna  Eireann, had stood as guard of honour. Two of their comrades. Con Colbert of Limerick and  Sean Heuston of Dublin, had been executed in 1916. Thousands came to pay homage, many in  tears, not least amongst them, were the poverty-stricken people whom she had succoured so well.  Ireland mourned one of her greatest heroines. Her greatness and her deeds shall not be forgotten.  SPONSORED BY  AN CUMANN CABHRACH  BERGEN COUNTY, NEW JERSEY  David Neeson, President  Pete Quinn, Treasurer

        <pagetext>OCTOBER 31.1992  CLINTON REAFFIRMS IRISH STANCE  With little more than a week  remaining until the Presidential  election, Democratic candidate  Bill Clinton reiterated his  strong pro-Irish stance, first  taken last April at the Irish  American Issues Forum.  Clinton, in a strongly worded statement  read by former Connecticut Congressman  Bruce Morrison, pledged support for a  special envoy to meet with all parties to the  conflict, supported the MacBride Principles,  and demanded safeguards against British  Crown forces' violence and collusion with  loyalist paramilitaries.  Clinton's statement was cheered by Irish  Americans, including members of Irish  Northern Aid, at a Clinton-Gore rally held  on October 23rd,in New York. Clinton's  position has already been strongly criticized  by the British government. Clinton noted,   The lasting contributions of the Irish-  American community are what have helped  make this country strong. Ireland has given  so much to our country, we owe a special  debt in return. We commend the Democratic  leaders in Congress who acted to end the  history of discrimination against Ireland  and other nations in our immigration laws.  And we will work to ensure that political  considerations do not hinder the workings  of our courts in asylum cases.   SPECIAL ENVOY  Clinton then referred to the current round  of negotiations taking place in Ireland and  said,  A Clinton Administration will take a  more active role in working with the leaders  in these nations to achieve a just and lasting  setdement of the conflict. A permanent and  peaceful solution to the crisis in northern  Ireland can only be achieved if the  underlying causes of the strife and  instability are dealt with vigorously, fairly  and within a time-frame that guarantees  genuine, substantial, and steady progress. I  believe that appointment of a US special  envoy to northern Ireland could be a catalyst  Bill Clinton  in the effort to secure a lasting peace.   MACBRIDE  Turning to the MacBride Principles,  Clinton said,  We believe that the British  government must do more to oppose the iob  discrimination      tha*       u ? ?  unemployment levels tw   and a half times  higher for Catholic workers   in Protestant  workers. There can be no lastly setdement  in northern Ireland until such discrimination  is ended. The MacBride Principles set forth  appropriate guidelines for investment to  help achieve these goals.   About the British shoot-to-kill policy and  collusion, the candidate said,  We also  believe that the British government must  establish effective safeguards against the  wanton use of lethal force and against  xaiuici collusion between  h?  ec?*ri v fsic   forces and Protestant paramilitary groups.   The Democratic frontrunner in the race  for the White House is on a collision course  with Britain over his Irish policy. If he wins  the presidential poll on November 3rd, it  could rupture the  special relationship   between Britain and the United States. Mr.  Clinton* s candidacy has been backed by  Sinn l;6in president (ierry Adams.  Mayor of Boston Raymond Flynn has  campaigned widely for Mr. Clinton among  Irish Americans, building support for the  governor's position on Ireland. Mr. Flynn  described the role Of a United Slates special  peace envoy to northern Ireland as  an  Impartial broker who would help spur on a  genuine peace process.   Mr Hynn was named as a possible choice  for the position by Mr. Clinton at a New  York lundraising event at tlie weekend.  The envoy plan has been coolly received  by Secretary of State Patrick Mayhew. lie  was quoted in the London Independent las   week as saying,  We do not need a peace  envoy, thank you very much,   adding  tersely,  What we need is a setdement as a  result of the talks process.   SINN FEIN  Sinn F6in President Gerry Adams,  commenting on Presidential candidate  Governor Bill Clinton's statement on the  conflict in Ireland, said,  I welcome  Governor BUI Clinton's commitment to  promote theall-importantobjectiveof peace  in Ireland by addressing the causes of the  conflict so as to eradicate them.   The British government's refusal to do  that in the current talks is the clearest  indication possible that creating the  conditions which make peace possible is not  on its agenda..   GovernorClinton'sacknowledgmentof  the British government's wanton use of  lethal force in its shoot-to-kill policy and  of the collusion between British forces and  loyalist murder gangs is a welcome censure  of the British government by a major  international political figure.   Likewise, Governor Clinton's support  for the MacBride Principles is welcome and  necessary additional political pressure from  the United States on the British government  to adopt effective measures to eradicate  disc imination in employment, an issue  upon which, as the recently leaked DED  documents demonstrate, current policy and  legislation has had no significant  positiveimpact.  Irish Northern Aid and the IRISH  PEOPLE Newspaper had previously  endorsed Governor Clinton.  muiMHiiiMiiMm  i  am,

        <pagetext>OCTOBER 31, 1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  PAGE 2  Ford Slammed for Discrimination  Sectarian divisions run deep in  the Ford Motor Company's  West Belfast plant, according to  a 27-page report leaked last  week.  This is despite company denials  that religious discrimination exists in  Fold's Finaghy Road North plant.  The report by the American-based  Investor Responsibility Research  Center (IRRC) stated that Catholics  were underrepresentcd in some job  categories and called for affirmative  action to rectify departmental  imbalances.  The draft report makes no  conclusions. Those involved are at  pains to point out that it is not in a  position to prove or disprove  complaints or grievances.  Nevertheless,  the  latest report  differs   from   the   IRRC   January   1991  Oliver Kearney of the Equality Group  examination of employment practices at  Ford and five other American companies  with factories in  northeast Ireland. Then,  the IRRC stated that the  278 Catholics in Ford's  700 workforce   accurately reflected the  rehgiousaffiliationofthe  working-age  population.  But in the  briefing paper dated July  1992 and received by  Ford management last  month, the IRRC reports  a catalog of cases of  alleged discrimination  againstCatholicworkers.  In September 1987,  Ford published its first  fair-employment  practices and policies  report and issued its own  set of principles. But in  the  IRRC  report  it  was  stated,   The  principles are not posted and management  does not appear to have done much lately  to keep the pledges made in the principles  in the forefront, except to make available  the annual report on compliance.  IRRC  added that  tension between Protestants and  Catholics at Ford is considerable  and that  there was  a strong sense of grievance  among some Catholic workers.  It pointed  out that  workers were pursuing  discrimination complaints.   A Ford Motor company spokesman for  Britain confirmed that it had received the  IRRC draft report last month. The Ford  representative said that the company would  not comment on the content of the draft  report or the conclusions of the final  version   to be received next month   until  after they had been studied.  The campaigning northeast Ireland  group, Equality, nevertheless described tlie  report as  fairly damning  and claimed that   serious imbalances  at management and  supervisory levels remained.  SANDS FAMILY ENDORSES  PETER KING FOR CONGRESS  Peter King and Rosa leen Sands at Hunger Strike Rally in Ireland  The family of Irish hunger striker Hobby Sands has announced its support  of Peter King in his campaign for Congress. In a statement from Belfast,  the Sands family said:  l4We are proud to endorse Peter  King's candidacy for the United  States 1 louse of Representatives, and  we urge all Americans who support  human rights, justice and freedom  for the Irish people to vote for Peter  King. Peter King is not only a friend  of our family, he is also a true friend  oi the nationalist community. He has  made repeated visits to the north of  Ireland at considerable personal and  political risk. At SO many key  moments the hunger strikes, the  plastic-bullet tribunal, the supergrass  trials, internment demonstrations  Peter King was the one American  who was always there.   Peter's election to Congress  will guaranteee that the Irish issue  is raised at the highest governmental  levels.   His  election  will   send   a  message to London and Dublin, as  well as to Washington, D.C., that  British oppression of the Irish people  will be subject to public scrutiny and  debate. Just as importantly, Peter  King's election will offer hope and  encouragement to the nationalist  community.   (signed) Rosaleen and John Sands  Marcella Sands Kelly  Hernadette Sands McKevitt  Seta Sands  King said that he was  gratified and  honored to be endorsed by the Sands  family. I have never met more noble or  courageous people, and I will do all that  1 can 10 justify their friendship and  support. When 1 am elected toCongress,  1 Will use all the powers of my office to  foCMS national attention on British  oppression in the occupied six  counties.   m  jpjyEfl  - '    ;*WnjS  -                                         i?B      ij   H  4*  -                   -  L A     i   sps  .

'.         -'-              Queen's University, symbol of discrimination  Kennedy Vows to Fight  Queen's on  Jobs Bias   Congressman Joe Kennedy has said  that he intends to step up his attempts  to see Queen's University's fair-  employment record highlighted in  the United States.  He warned that he also plans to ensure  that the university is not helped by   American-taxpayer dollars or funds at  any level.  He described the university as  a  bastion of sectarianism in northeast  Ireland'* when it came to fair employment.  A statement from the Congressman's  Washington office follows an exchange  a month ago in which he called on  Queen's to tackle its fair-employment  problem. Tlie university claimed that it  was the victim of a smear campaign.  In his latest statement, Congressman  Kennedy says,  When all is said and done  and the excuses are set aside, the cold hard  fact remains that Queen's University  shamelessly continues as a bastion of  sectarianism in northeast Ireland on the  question of fair-employment practices.  Bar a university with a student body with  a nationalist majority not to reflect  comparable numbers from the community  in its hiring and promotion policies is not  only inexcusable, it adds to the division  in the whole of northeast Ireland's society.   How can Queen's justify a workforce  where only one in four of its employees  comes from the nationalist community?   He added that the university had an  obligation to  actively recruit  within the  nationalist community and to demonstrate  that it was clearly opposed to religious  discrimination.   For a university that is the training  ground for so many of northeast Ireland's  civil servants, developing an ethos that it  is opposed to religious discrimination is  vital.   He claimed that the university was  intent on  trying to preserve the status  quo  and that this had done nothing for  its reputation at home or overseas.  A university spokesman replied,   Misleading and uncorroborated  assertions about the university's policies  and practices are unhelpful in furthering  fair-employment and equal-opportunities  objectives to which this university is  committed.

        <pagetext>OCTOBER 31,1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  ROBINSON DEMANDS SINN FEIN BAN  Sinn F  in has said that if Ian  Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party  deputy Peter Robinson were to apply  his interpretation of the law to his  own party, he would be arguing for  the DUP to be banned.  Belfast councillor Mairtin ()  Muilleoir was replying to a call by  Robinson for Sinn F6in to be proscribed.  Robinson had given British Secretary  Patrick Mayhew a 24-page dossier  which argues the case for such a ban.  Robinson said that the dossier showed  that Sinn F6in was  welded indivisibly   to the IRA.  It also emerged that Sinn F6in has been  preparing a dossier on the DUP which it  intends releasing to the media next week.  Mr. O Muilleoir referred to what he  called the hypocrisy of Peter Robinson and  his    party.     The    DUP's    record    of  involvement    with  loyalistparamilitary  groups began with  the foundation of the  party. Thatcollusion  was   clearly   seen  during    the    1974  loyalist strike,  Paisley's    abortive  1977    strike,    the  mountaintop  exploits of Paisley,  the   foundation   of  Ulster    Resistance,  and    much    more  besides,     Mr.    O  Muilleoir said.  Robinson told a press conference that  Sinn F n was the IRA s partner and  accomplice. He said the evidence more than  met the basic legal requirements for the  Peter Robinson, In beret,  of Loyalist paramilitary  outlawing of Sinn F6in. Mayhew will  shortly outline in Parliament his case for the  recent outlawing of the loyalist Ulster  Defence Association. Robinson said it  would be difficult for Mayhew to defend tlie  decision not to do the same to Sinn F6in.   He is going to have to convince the  House of Commons that he is acting in  northeast Ireland in an even-handed,  balanced way. In a society which is divided,  you cannot act in a way which clearly  indicates that you abhor violence from one  side of tlie community but you are prepared  to close your eyes to violence from tlie  other,  Robinson said.  The British Northern Ireland Office said  it was studying the DUP document on Sinn  F6in but added,  The evidence is that Sinn  F6in is not an organization which is actively  and primarily engaged in the commission  of criminal terrorist acts   that is tlie  criterion which government applies when  proscribing organizations,   Protesters Issue Broadcasting Ban Challenge  an early meeting to discuss a review of the  ban.  Central TV studios in Birmingham were  picketed by members of the Tnxips Out  Movement protesting against the  broadcasting ban on Sinn F n,  Spokesperson Mary Pearson said,  We  believe that unless the views of everyone  in tlie conflict in northeast Ireland are  listened to, there will never be peace.*1  lour Derry Sinn Fftin councillors staged  an occupation of Radio Foyle's studios in  protest    of    what     they     called    tlie  udemonization and vilification  of their  members by tlie broadcasting ban. Hugh  Brady. Barney McFadden, Dodie  McGuiiiness, and Gcaroid () hHara entered  the Foyle Building just before 1:00 p.m.  They passed through a security check by  pretending that they had business with a  reporter, then slipped quickly into the  studios. Meanwhile, outside the station gate  a group of Sinn Fein supporters mounted a  picket. Thfi station was forced 10 cancel its  Newsdesk at One program, which was  replaced by Radio Ulster s Newsbreak.  Sinn Fein Pledges to  Continue Talks with Churchmen  I  Protest outside the BBC  Journalists have been urged by Sinn  Fein to break the law and ignore the  British government ban on  broadcasting comments by the  party's members.  Sinn F  in councillors joined party  President Gerry Adams and Ard-  Chomhairle member Jim Gibney in a  demonstration outside BBC headquarters in  Belfast's Ormeau Avenue. The  demonstrators marked the anniversary of the  ban imposed by the then British Home  Secretary Douglas Hurd by handing in a  letter of protest to Broadcasting House.  Derry City councillor Mitchel  McLaughlin said that the ban was initially  opposed by the National Union of  Journalists, the Independent Broadcasting  Authority and the BBC. He said that John  Bird, the BBC director general in 1988,  promised to lobby MPs and  take the  argument to the public through newspapers  and public appearances.    Sinn F6in is challenging the  broadcasters and broadcasting journalists to  state exactly what opposition they have  mounted or intend to mount against the  directives.   We must also complain to broadcasters  that in operating the ban, they have been  over-stringent and over-cautious in its  interpretation. There have been many  occasions when Sinn F  in could have been  interviewed on social and economic matters  but was not. In those rare instances where  our spokespersons were interviewed, it was  often only as aresult of incessant lobbying,   said Mr. McLaughlin.  Referring to the recent sub-titling of  comments by former MP Bernadette  McAliskey on a BBC television program,  Mr.McLaughlinsaidthatself-censorshipby  broadcasters had taken over where official  censorship left off.  'The interpretation of tlie ban appears  to be becoming even more restrictive as self-  censorship and fear of criticism from tlie  political establishment Uikes a stronger  grip   Calling on broadcasting journalists to reexamine their opposition to the ban, Mr.  McLaughlin said,  The best challenge that  they could make to this authoritarian  directive is, of course, to break the ban.   Only when the broadcasters find the  courage to do that will opposition be  galvanized and the British government  forced to restore to the British public their  right to freedom of information.   A BBC spokesman said that director  general Michael Checkland had written to  Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke, asking for  Sinn Fdin  leaders and  Presbyterian  churchmen have  promised to  persevere in  their  peace   talks.  The pledge  followed a meeting  between Sinn F6in  President Gerry  Adams and  Chairman Tom  Hartley, and former  moderators Dr. Jack  PI  1      i B      j  * 1  J   '.  Weir  Tom Hartley seated along with Mitchell McLaughlin  and  Godfrey Brown.  The two sides said they would continue  talks despite differences between them. In  a statement they  reaffirmed that the search  for peace demanded continuing and  persevering dialogue together.  The  churchmen said they were convinced that  peace-making was a special obligation on  any church which sought to follow Christ  as prince of peace.  The joint statement said:  Any progress,  humanly speaking, depended on a reduction  and, if possible, a speedy ending to tlie  present violence in our society, which  placed such a barrier in the way of  understanding and strengthenedaresistance  among so many to fruitful dialog.   Mr.  Adams called on  churches  to  develop a  peace strategy . He said,  As a  first step in apeace process, the Presbyterian  Church should embrace the principle of  inclusive dialog.   Sinn F6in sources said the talks were   useful ; they were not a short-term process  but part of a long-term one.  In a separate statement, Mr. Adams  criticized Church of Ireland Primate Dr.  Robin Frames. He said there was a  contradiction between the primate's claim  that he supported dialog and his rejection  of Sinn F6in*s participation in talks. The  archbishop had  a clear moral  responsibility  to support an  inclusive  dialog .  The Voice oe Irish Rei gt;i rijcasism is America

Speaking on human rights and due process  violations in the north of Ireland were Judge  Andy Somers and Cody McCone. Judge  Somers, a veteran observer of court  proceedings in the north, relayed his  shocking experiences of the lack of due  process in the British justice system. Mr.  McCone, president of the Brehon Law  Society, outlined steps his organization is  taking at the United Nations to help achieve  real justice in the six counties.  Speaking from his own experiences with  the policies of deportation, Gerry McGeogh  gave a stirring address on the personal  tragedy he and his family have suffered.  James Smyth stated his first-hand  experiences of abuse in our justice system.  Speaking on Mr. Smyth's behalf was his  attorney Karen Snell, who outlined efforts  underway to ensure that Mr. Smyth would  not suffer the same fate at Joe Doherty. Dan  Lawton, attorney for the detained Kevin  Artt, highlighted the fate of his client who  is in jail in California also on extradition  charges. Tim Cotton of the Francis  Gildernew Defense Fund, and Mr.  Gildernew himself addressed the  convention. Both outlined the malicious  extradition case the United States  government is proceeding with because of  Mr Gildernew's activism on Irish issues.  Frank Durkan, known for his outstanding  efforts in defending extradition suspects in  this country, received the Pat Finucane  Award. Former congressman Bruce  MorrisonreceivedthePaulO'Dwyer Award  for his herculean efforts for Irish  immigrants, whichresultedin die  Morrison  Vise  program. Assemblyman John Burton  of San Francisco received the Sean  MacBride Award for his sponsorship of the  MacBride Principles campaign in  California. Assemblyman Burton pledged  Bto double his efforts on MacBride to ensure  passage, and to help Mr. Smyth and Mr. Artt  BOSTON THREE  fight extradition. Robert Ballagh of the Irish  National Congress was one keynote speaker  who spoke of his work to preserve articles  two and three of the Irish Constitution. Mr.  Ballagh stressed that if articles two and three  were repealed, only the British government  would have legal claim to represent the  people of the six counties, which just will  not do.  Without exception, the greatest response  was given to the other keynote speaker, Mr.  Ken Livingstone, Labour MP. Mr.  Livingstone spoke on the scope of  involvement by British military intelligence  in the north. Mr. Livingstone has written a  book on the involvement of tlie British in  Uiecampaign of terror againstthe nationalist  population. Mr. Livingstone brought the  convention to its feet, when he challenged  the British government to sue him for  slander for charges made in his book, so he  could prove the scandalous British  involvement in northeast Ireland in a  courtroom.  Sincerely,  Neil G. Flanagan  Costa Mesa, CA  TO the Editor, Irish People  By now you should all know that the  so-called Supreme Court has refused to hear  the appeal of our case brought before it .  This travesty of Justice continues. The  dangerousprecedentestablishedheredenies  tlie protection of the Fourth Amendment of  the Constitution to anyone the government  wishes. In effect, the Bill of Rights is  meaningless. With one stroke, the document  hundreds of thousands of Americans died  to preserve has been cast upon die dung heap  of history. It lasted a little over two hundred  years until Bush and his court destroyed it.  It takes no genius to see that this  country is in mortal danger. Hie forces at  work in the current administration are doing  everything in Uieir power to change this  nation into a sad blend of Hitler's Germany  and Stalin's USSR. Don't listen to their  words, look at their actions. One right after  another, one freedom after another has been  quitely stolen from us. We are at die  threshold at which we cease to be a nation  and become a police state   the national  security state of die world. Their apparatus  is in place at diis minute. If this frightens  you, it should. At this minute, in this prison  I am living the life you will all live in the  future...unless you do something now.  Do what?  First and foremost get out and  vote  Get this corrupt gang out of the White  House as soon as possible. Get everyone  you can out to vote to defeat this tyrant now   I am not the only one on the line. You, your  families and your dependents are all in  danger. No one can profess to be a supporter  of Irish freedom (or American freedom) and  vote for Bush. To do so is a lie.  Second, lake an active interest in  what goes on in this government. Learn  about our case as an example of what can  go wrong. Write to your representatives and  senators to complain about our treatment.  This issue effects your lives, too. Tell them  how you feel. Demand something be done.  Finally, 1 wish to thank everyone  who has expressed their support and  solidarity. It makes all the difference in tlie  world. We will all triumph in this battle     only if we fight VOTE   Richard Johnson   Ravhrook, NY  D'Amato versus Abrams and the Irish Dimension  By now, most New York voters have  received one or more carefully crafted   legislative  bulletins from Senator Al  D'Amato. Recendy he aimed one such  piece of literature at his Irish-American  constituents. In it, New York's junior  Senator proclaimed,  ...he is proud to  support the causes of the Irish both here and  abroad.  The literature was fairly  standard   a blend of half-truths and  misstatements lacking only the disclaimer   For amusement purposes only.  The letter  format addressed the case of Joe Doherty,  the MacBride Fair Employment Principles  and immigration, all of which are related to  a conflict which has commanded little of the  Senator's interest in his twelve years in  CD INVESTORS  CAN YOU AFFORD TO EARN  ONLY 4  A YEAR?

In fact, die appeal points to a  troublesome dilemma for tlie Senator He  is faced with die nation's largest ami most  active Irish-American constituency and  Reagan-Bush policies dial ignored or were  indifferent to die Irish conflict and its  victims. As a result, die Irish American  activists have galvanized as never before.  The tension between the  making waves   image the Senator relishes and the  missing  in action  reality of his record is apparent  in the very issues he claims to champion.  Consider  The Senator never batded the White  House or the Republican-controlled Senate  in 1985 when a shameful, retroactive British  extradition treaty was ratified. Nor did he  fight them during Doherty 's 5-year  deportation/asylum struggle that followed.  He setded for last-minute letter writing that  was crafted more for media consumption  than as a serious challenge to State  Department policies.  Since 1984, the Senator who  takes them  on hasco-sponsoredaMacBride Principles  bill that has yet to be given a Congressional  hearing. Senator D' Amato was urged to link  any US contributions to the British-  concocted International Fund for Ireland  (IFI) to the MacBride Principles, but he did  not, and he suddenly became a wallflower  during the 1986 debate. IFTs proven track  record of waste and sectarian spending was  rewarded last month with  20 million,  Senator D'Amato's vote and his silence.  On the other hand, Mr. D'Amato has  missed opportunities to, at the very least,  give visibility to these same  Irish causes.   The annual debate over foreign aid to  various thugs or the trading status of nations  like China are ideal times to run down  Britain's sorry record of human- and civil-  rights violations in Ireland.  During the loan-guarantee debates, he  could have asked the President why he   hondles  Israel for refugee housing but  sanctions IFI taxes being used to line the  pockets of British hotel magnates. When tlie  Cuban exile Orlando  Bosch,  who was  convicted of placing a bomb on an airliner  that killed HO persons, was granted asylum,  why didn' 11V Amato demand that President  Bush give the same consideration to Joe  Doherty, whose case had far more merit?  What impact all this may have on Senator  D'Amato's re-election is anyone's guess.  Although the issues of freedom, democracy  and justice are as important in Ireland as in  the Congo, Nicaragua or China, the scale  of the conflict is small and the merit of the  struggle is often obscured or censored by  the British media managers. The mistakes  alluded to here are, after all, acts of  omission. The Senator has not yet taken to  praising British justice and their generosity  to the Irish, as does Senator Moynihan, who  is viewed more as a surrogate spokesman  for British interests in the US Senate. There  is also the question of how much Senator  D'Amato can be justifiably criticized when  the duties of Dublin's diplomats in  Washington seem to be confined to poetry  parties and shamrock presentations.  As for his opponent, there is not a lot of  evidence of Bob Abrams' positions on the  issues related to Ireland' s conflict except for  his remarks at the Irish American Senate  Forum in August. This is surprising,  considering the Attorney General's early  political career in the Bronx, a veritable  cauldron of Irish and Irish American  activism.  Many were impressed, as was I, with  Senator D'Amato's 1980 visit to the North  of Ireland in spite of the State Department's  directives that he should not do so. But  fame, fortune, and a more effective Jewish  lobby liave shifted tlie Senator's priorities  over die years and somewhat tarnished that   making waves  reputation he portrays in  his mailing. Those concerned with Ireland's  conflict know that real Senate leadership  from New York could be significant and  could have an impact on peace and justice  there. Unfortunately, many of these same  persons supported Senator D'Amato,  expecting a pit bull dog and instead getting  a pussy cat. Michael Cummings  The Voice of Irish Republicanism in America

        <pagetext>OCTOBER 31,1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  BELFAST PERSPECTIVE  Fr. Dks Wilson  MULTINATIONAL  LINKS  British strategy to keep military and  economic control of the northeast of  Ireland now includes creating  trading links between 4tnorth  and   south''. One has to put this into  context.  Many years ago, the British government  was able lo hold the area by  planting   settlersandindustries.Hventually,however,  especially in the 70s and '80s, tlie British  economy became impoverished, and many  Of these industries could DO longer be kept  in Ireland, the British government then  made a bid to get American, Dutch and  French companies into the north, with  generous allowances and giants. These  companies were to provide what British  companies had done in the past: bring some  jobs, but impermanent industrialization.  The one tlun  that had to be avoided at  all costs was encouraging native Irish  industry in the area. If British industry could  not be successfully planted any longer, then  mainland European, American or Japanese  industry would do. Such foreign investment  would depend on British subsidies and  would come and go according to market  needs   and the Irish would liave no control  over their coming, their going or their  staying.  MULTINATIONAL  Today there is enormous competition for  such international and multinational  companies. The British government, with  its hold on Ireland becoming more and more  insecure (and with increasing poverty at  home making the government think about  future deploymentof its troops on the streets  of Liverpool, Cardiff and Glasgow rather  than Belfast), is now looking to other means  of filling its industrial needs in Ireland's  northeast.  BURDEN  Two things are important. One is to  reduce tlie financial burden which tlie  northeast represents for the British; another  is to reduce tlie need to have English,  Scottish and Welsh tnx)ps there. They have  tried to ensure that whatever fighting is done  in Ireland will be done by Irish. The B  Specials became the UDR, which became  ajCIrislTregimentdeployed in the forefront  of whatever fighting they cause in Ireland     while their own troops can be brought back  home. That, the British think, will fill tlie  military gap. To fill tlie industrial gap, they  are encouraging  cross-border trade and  cooperation.  Thus, even if the British  industrialists cannot comeand the European  and Americans do not come, somebody will  come.  DUNNE STORES  Ben Dunne will come. The British  government has now realized that with a  southern economy increasingly able tomake  money and engage in international trading,  its best shot is to encourage southern firms  to expand north and northern firms to do  business with the south.  It is not an exercise in democracy or   reconciliation . It is an exercise in making  sure that the northeast, weakened to poverty  by 70 years of inefficient government, still  survives with a minimum of Irish control.  Britain builds on Multinationals  Whether Ben Dunne or anyone else comes  will depend on British decisions. Such  persons may get enticing subsidies or a  bomb through their windows, or both,  depending on prevailing British strategies.  There are problems, however. While  many businesspersons north and south want  simply to do business and are already  overcoming old and once profitable barriers  of sectarianism in order to do so, local  politicians are not keeping pace with their  thinking. Many firms have already formed  north/soutliconnections,butBritishunionist  politicians in the northeast are intellectually  and by training and culture incapable of  thinking about economics.  The SDLP's John Hume thinks in terms  of Euro economics and imported  capital. Gerry Adams thinks in terms  of Irish internal economics as the  mainstay of future independence,  with Europe and America as icing on  what could be a substantial cake. But  the British unionists   Paisley,  Molyneaux, Maginnis, etc.   have  never been known to create an  economic plan or put forward an idea  about the economy of Ireland, or even  of the northeast.  GAPS  The intellectual incapability is now  being recognized as a major  impediment to the British plan to fill  up the gaps in Ireland's northeast with  industry which, even if it is  unavoidably Irish-based, is  nevertheless under the ultimate  control of nobody within the British-  occupied zone except the British  themselves.  British unionists have not noticed  that in spite of their anti-Catholic  campaigns, Ben Dunne has come in  from  the south  to buy Wellworths,  thus becoming one of the northeast's  biggest employers, while Bombardier of  Quebecown Shorts, another large employer.  Like others who are now coming into the  stagnant commercial and industrial scene of  the  northeast,   they  are  Catholics.   As  commercial operators, they are no better and  no worse for that.  One feels neither elation nor depression  at their coming. One feels depression at the  fact that the British unionists cannot deal  intellectually with this or anything else that  is happening to them. They have been left  too long with no thinking to do.  IRISH LEADERS BACK ALBANESE  Irish American leaders gathered  on October 26, 1992 at New York  City Hall to formally endorse Sal  Albanese, the I )emocratic  candidate for the House of  Representatives in new York's  13th Congressional District.  Albanese, a Democratic New York  City  lt;    ouncil member, has served in the  City Council since 1982, earning a  reputation as a an outspoken leader on  Irish issues. He was the first municipal  ;lator in the United States to spons lt;    the MacBride principles. Alhanese is  challenging the Incumbent  congressmember, Susan Molinari  Martin Galvin. die General Counsel o   Irish Northern Aid Committee, said.    It is  seldom noted that Brooklyn City Council  member Sal Albanese introduced the fust  MacBride Principle's Bill Is New York  CU) l le was among the first to support Joe  Doherty. He condemned the murders of  Sinn fern woikcis and iuiiixluccd City  Council bills on the  Winchester Rucc'   plastic bullets. Sinn lein s  Scenario for  Peace   a d  a  multitude  of  other   Irish  Sal Albanese  concerns. Many  council members in  New York now have  taken a a strong  position on Irish  issues only because  Sal Albanese led the  way. His opponent  Susan Molinari has  taken no real position  on Irish issues. Elect  Sal Albanese to  Congress    Jack Irwin,  Nationallmmigration  Director of tlie  Ancient Order of  Hibernians, added,   Sal was in the  forefront when there  was a battle to secure  New York City  funding for irish  immigrant assistant  centers. He has  always been there for  the Irish-American  community   AlO'Hagan, with  the A.O.H. and the 1986 New York Saint  Patrick's Day Parade Grand Marshall, noted  that  Sal has always been there attending  every large and small Irish event over the  past decade. He can do great things for Irish-  Americans in Washington.   The American Irish Congress and the  Emerald Society of the New York City  Transit Police Department have also  endorsed Albanese for Congree.  The director of Irish-Americans for  Albanese, Justin Kelly, said,  Sal has a well-  earned reputation among Irish-Americans as  a leader on issues of concern to our  community. He was the first municipal  legislator in the nation to sponsor the  MacBride Principles. He was a leading  supporter of Joe Doherty. Indeed, while he  was the only member of the Council to vote  against a resolution supporting Doherty.   Kelly added,  She has done absolutely  nothing on Irish issues. Frankly, her record  is a disaster which reflects her lack of  interest in our community.   Albanese is running for the  Congressional seat which encompasses all  of Staten Island as well as the Bay Ridge,  Dyker Heights, BensonhurstandCrravesend  neighborhoods of Brooklyn.

        <pagetext>OCTOBER 31,1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  REAGAN/BUSH  MOB ABANDONING SHIP  The final countdown has begun in  the nation's capital. Defeat and  desperation are in the air. Lifeboats  are filling up outside government  agencies faster than they did on the  night the mighty Titanic sank in the  waters off Newfoundland. For  twelve years, the country has been  dominated by the greedy and amoral  Reagan/Bush mob. Now, the clock  is running out.  The plundering of America's natural and  industrial resources, the loss of our  sovereignty, and the erosion of our  democratic values under these scoundrels  and their surrogates, has been  unprecedented. The offenders are now  running for cover.  As election day approaches, the  ubiquitous smirk on George Bush is  beginning to disappear. A Bill Clinton/Al  Gore victory is adistinct possibility. Capitol  Hill pundits are predicting that the busiest  person in the next administration will be the  Attorney General. Hurray   The job of getting to the bottom of the  white-collar crimes caused by cronies of  Reagan/Bush will be enormous. Neil Bush,  one of tlie President's sons, named in the  Silverado S   L failure, is just a small player  in the larger drama.  Irish Americans have been in the  forefront of warning the people about the  excesses of these charlatans. From the  extradition case of Joe Doherty to the cruel  ordeal of Sean Mackin and the  Boston  Three , from Francis Gildemew to James  Smydi and Kevin Barry Artt, our voices  have been raised. As a result, some of us  have been harassed by agencies of the  UnitedStatesgovernment.Nevertheless, we  have also cautioned about Britain's growing  economic stranglehold (now S125 billion)  in this country and their criminal  interference with our federal elections.  IranContragate, the BCCI mess (now  being referred to as the Bank of Crooks and  Criminals), the merger mania piracies and  the BNL Iraq scandal   all happened during  Bush's watch. The White House has played  a major part in these sordid sagas and in their  subsequentcoverup. Things are presently so  bad, and morale so low in the Bush  Administration, thattheCentral Intelligence  Agency and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation are openly investigating each  other. Daggers have been drawn.  BRITISH TIES  The S500 billion looting of America's S    L's took place while George Bush  not  only looked the other way, but actively  intervened to keep a failing S   L open .  (See Jonathan Kwitney's expose', Village  Voice, Oct. 20th). Kwitney reports that   hundreds of millions of dollars in  questionable loans ended up enriching the  friends of George Bush, the CIA, favorite  Republican causes, among them the contras  and Jonas Savimbi's war in Angola.  He  connects Anglo-American predators,  confederates of Bush and ex-Secretary of  State James Baker, in Houston, New York  and Washington, D.C., to the S   L  catastrophe.  Now those who brought the nation  the grossly inept Ed Meese, Richard  Tricky  Dick  Thornburgh, and the bumbling  William P. Barr, in the role of Attorney  General, are abandoning the ship of state.  The sorry chapter on the monumental  mugging of the American taxpayers and  carjacking of our revered Bill of Rights is  mercifully coming to an end.  Enormous amounts of wealth were  corruptly transferred from tlie many to the  few during tlie last 12 years. Justice requires  that the guilty be punished and the monies  restored. It also mandates that the previous  wrongs done to the Irish American  community by the Reagan/Bush regime be  rectified by die new Democratic  Administration. It is time also to terminate  die misnamed  special relationship  with  Britain.  Absent a Democratic collapse,  assisted covertly by thugs from Whitehall,  it looks like curtain time for Bush and his  hatchetman, J. Danforth  Danny Boy   Quayle. Good riddance  The country has  suffered enough under these anglophiles.  WHERE IS IRELAND'S  DESMOND TUTU?   We live in a moral universe.  Right and wrong do matter. The truth will  out in the end,  said Archbishop 1 )esmond  Tutu. The winner of die 1984 Nobel Peace  l ize spoke at Johns Hopkins University,  in Baltimore, on October 17th, before an  overflow audience of admirers. I could not  help but think while listening to the words  of this great champion of freedom for South  Africa,  Where is Ireland's Desmond  Tutu?  Where indeed   Recently, the entire hierarchy of  the Irish Church journeyed over to Rome  to celebrate the feast day of one of the saints.  No one dared to raise the truth about British  violence in the six counties. Not one  The  notion of Bishop Tutu not speaking the truth  about South Africa is simply unthinkable.  And yet for Ireland it is considered  commonplace not to speak out on the  situation in the north.  Tutu said of the struggle for self-  determination in his homeland,  No matter  how many guns you use, no matter how  many people get killed., it is an inexorable  truth that freedom will prevail in the end,  that injustice and repression and violence  will not have the last word.  The moral  intensity of his expression held most of tlie  audience mesmerized.  PAGE 7  TWO BRAVE  DISSENTERS  On April 18,1989, two brave Irish  Former President Ronald Reagan with former Irish Prime Minister  Garret Fitzgerald  How did we get into this fix where  we feel so alienated from so many of our  clergy on the national question? Since tlie  Treaty of Maynooth, the church has  become, in facu if not in name, an ally of  the colonizers (See Father Joe McVeigh's  The Wounded Church). In their Faustian  bargain with Whitehall, die clergy have  moved from being our spiritual advisers to  agents for maintaining the political status  quo. This is a role Uiat their predecessors,  the priestly druids, could never imagine  The druids were always of and for  the people   true servants of the tribe. The  idea thai they could serve any other master  was alien to their calling. This is why Julius  Caesar saw lit to crush the droidic order  after he conquered die Celts in ancient Gaul.  He rightly feared the druids' unique role in  maintaining the solidarity and viability of  the race.  parish priests, 1 Esmond Wilson and Joseph  McVeigh, direcdy addressed tlie Irish  Catholic hierarchy. In a pamphlet,  appropriately entitled,  The Truth Will Set  You Eree*  they took the Bishops to task.   You have ignored,  they wrote,   tlie basic cause of political violence in  Ireland: The inability of the British state to  govern justly By calling for acceptance of  the armed institutions of the unjust and  antidemocratic northern state, you are  contributing to the continuation of the  conflict rather than its resolution   They  pleaded with the Bishops to call for a   moratorium on one-sided condemnations  of violence, to advocate dialog with all the  parties, and to acknowledge that it is an  unjust government which is at the root of  die conflict in die occupied six counties    The Bishops, sinfully, chose to ignore the  petition of the two dissenting prelates.  CELTIC NEW YEAR  The MacBride Chapter,  Irish Northern Aid, will hold their annual  Celtic New Year celebration on  Saturday evening, October 31st, at  Hibernian House, Pearl River.  James Bredin, a native of Leitrim and long-time Pearl  River resident, has been selected as Celt of the Year.  Music and entertainment will be by  Jim McPhail. Ken Tierney will  discuss Samhain lore.  The candle-lighting ceremony for the six Celtic  nations will be followed by the Celts Circle of Unity.  Refreshments will be provided.  Donation  12.50.

I think one of them is  Sheena Campbell . A friend's voice on the phone,  Friday evening, shortly after eight. The words hit me  like a punch in the stomach. Sheena. No, not Sheena.  Driving to the Royal Victoria  Hospital on die Fall* Road, hoping  that she is there, injured may he, hut  close to her friends. No admissions  tonight, the clerk says, your friend  must be in the City.  More driving through  the   night.    At   the  reception we are told  yes,        she        was  admitted, to go into a  small room.  There a  chaplain is waiting to  break   the   news   to  relatives.   Oh   (iod.

Pat Fmucane was  such an opponent. Mowed down by  loyalists a few weeks off his 40th  birthday. A lawyer who was  challenging what the British state  was doing to the Irish people. And  Sheena, who in a few weeks would  have been 30. In her second veai of  law. Sheena's challenge to the  British state had been through Sinn  I cin. but who knows what else she  might have done with her talents  Sheena*s enemies did not wait to  find out  We wait a little more, hoping lo  catch Brendan, Sheena s partner,  who is  on his way**, An old man  is led down a corridor to collect his  wife's belongings, He looksfbiiorn  She Is dead, and he catties on alone.

Then I saw this  small figure, a young girl, sitting at  a desk ticking off names, adding  Sheena with John O'Dowd and Brendan Curran handing  in her nomination papers to Craiagavon Civic Centre in  April 1989  figures. Blue eye-shadow, short  brown hair, high cheek bones,  Sheena looked about eighteen.  Someone else m a corner sorting  sheets from registers.

There she attended  Lismore Comprehensive School.  She left it at 16, with no incentive to  go on, no sense then that she could  make it*. Sheena went to work in a  factory. Her mother too had left  school young, gone to work. Yet her  younger brothers, Sheena's uncles,  had continued on at school, gone to  university, kmade if out of second-  class citizenship.  The l;agans are a musical family.  Sheena loved  music, Irish  music, country  and western,  classical. She  sang a lot,  learned die piano.  A keen netball  player, she  missed selection  to the Six  Counties squad  because of her  small height. But  from the start  Sheena's life was  politics. In her  early teens she  started selling  Republican  News, went with  her mother to  meetings and  marches. At  fourteen she was  acting secretary  of her local Sinn  I(3in cumann.  She would attend  as delegate the  meetings of the  Ulster Executive,  the forerunner of  the Comhairle na  S6 Chondae. She  also did a stint as  a youth leader in the local youth  club, and was active on several  community and tenants'  associations.  She joined the Relatives' Action  Committee as soon as one was  formed in Craigavon. As the fight to  end criminalisation of Irish POWs  was intensifying, Sheena became  more active, and helped form a  youth committee, the first Youth  Against Armagh and H-Blocks,   before it was ever heard of in  Belfast,  she rightly claimed.  During the hunger strike, she was to  lead a pupils' walk-out out of her old  school, 1 ismore Comprehensive.  One oi her teachers there was  Tom French, of the Workers' Party,  with whom she had many an  argument while at school. In 1985,  aged only 23, she would stand  against him in the local elections, in  the ('raigavon Central ward. Sheena  polled tw ice as many first preference  votes as her former teacher, and  political rival. But while she failed  to get elected, Tom French  benefitted from transfers from the  Alliance Party and got a council seat.  Nevertheless, this spelled the end for  1'om Frcnch in that ward. (At the  next local elections, he shifted to the  Lockside ward where he got his seat  with die help of unionist transfers.)  Sheena had to leave work at  eighteen, because of a heart  condition. She got married then. Her  marriage ended amicably a few  years later, and she shared her life  between her son Caolan, and her  politics.  People  in   Sinn  F  in  quickly  afterwards, call me a 'brat'.    The local Sinn F6in organisation  was reorganised along constituency  lines. I got credited for this,   Brendansays,  but die credit wasn't  mine. I knew nothing about the area  The organising and restructuring  was Sheena's work.  Sheena  became chairperson of the  Comhairle Ceanntair in 1986. She  also held positions on the Comhairle  recognised her organising abilities.  While she held the position of  secretary on the Comhairle  Ceanntair, her role was in fact that  of an organiser. She was nominated  as candidate for Sinn F6in in the  Assembly elections of October  1982, but her name had to be  withdrawn   she was underage, not  yet 20   Brendan Curran, her partner,  recalls how he first met her.  There  were problems in the local Sinn F6in  organisation in 1982-'83, and I was  sent to this meeting, I was not long  out of jail, they must have hoped that  the presence of someone recently  released from the H-B locks might  stop people from bickering and  fighting. So I got cleaned up and  shaved, and arrived at this meeting  with not a clue as to what it was  about. I sat at the top table, beside  Sheena, who was secretary. Sheena  Limisteir as secretary and organiser.  She traveled a lot tlirough the Upper  Bann area, South Down, Newry-  Armagh. She was well-known and  loved everywhere. Ather funeral last  Sunday, the large crowds came from  all over the North, and quite a few  from the 26 Counties as well.  Yet in spite of her abilities Sheena  was always reluctant to take on  positions. She only agreed to speak  in public as a stand-in for a comrade  who could not make it. This is how  she came to speak at the Easter  commermoration in Cullyhanna in  1983, her first public engagement.  Jim McAllister recalls how she was  nervous at first, and then did so well  that the local people kept asking for  her to come back.  But her forte was organising.   She had a gift for details,   Brendan says,  she just seemed to  know what was needed, where the  wee cogs were missing along the  Sheena*s father and sister Gabrielle bearing her  Tricolor-draped coffin  pulled out this book and started  writing. Tut that book on the table  and let on you know what you are  doing,' I quipped. She looked at me.  She would slag me for this for years  way.  Sheena talked about  structuring meetings before anyone  else in Sinn Fein, and drew up for  her Limist6ar detailed papers  describing the jobs involved in each  of the positions. She took training  sessions with local secretaries and  chairpersons. Yet she never saw  herself as anyone of outstanding  ability. She never realised how  relevant and important she was to the  republican struggle. Her enemies  obviously did.  Of course to republican activists  throughout the North, whether or not  dicy came into personal contact with  Sheena, she remains the architect of  what came to be known as the  Torrent Strategy', named after the  local by-election in the Torrent ward  of Dungannon in (date). But it  should really have been named the  'Upper Bann strategy', since this is  where this professional, systematic  approach to election work was  developed, or, perhaps more  appropriately, the SheenaCampbell  strategy', since she developed it. In  the constituency tiiat she worked in,  and the wards she was brought into  to direct operations, Sheena ended  years of amateurish, haphazard  election work and helped election  workers schedule their work, record  their findings and complete all the  tasks effectively and efficientiy.  Brendan recalls in amazement  how she turned the situation around  in die Torrent ward, getting Francie  Moiloy elected against the odds.   She went into Tyrone, and you  know how parochial they can be  down there, and she took control and  chastised them all, and in the end got  Francie elected. She even got  Brendan Doris - 'Basil' to his friends      to wear a tie, well, at least to carry  one in his pocket at all times.   Sheena had planned everyone's  timetable in detail, and Francie  remembers how one day, as he had  asked her how she thought things  were going, she said,  Everything  is fine, but you shouldn't disappear  for an hour when there is work to be  done .  I thought she  hadn't noticed that I had  slipped out to get abreak.  She didn't miss  anything .  But the workers got  their own back. She used  to tell canvassers off for  spending too long  chatting on the doorsteps.  On a canvass with  Seamus Nugent, Jim  McAllister and Brendan  Curran, she decided to  show them how it was  done.  Anybody in? ,  she shouted into the  house. But the farmer  was at his work in the  cowshed.  I can't hear  you,  he shouted back.   Sheena, who as always  was immaculately turned  out, had to wade through  several inches of cow  manure in her high heels  to deliver her election message,   Jim McAllister recalls.  That was  die end of her canvassing for that  day .  At the end of last year Sinn F6in's  education department decided to run  workshops for election workers,  based on the Torrent     on Sheena  Campbell's      Strategy. Some of us  were asked to prepare  an   education   pack  based on it. We had  anticipated we would  spend  a  few  hours  talking   to   Sheena,  then write it all down,  structure it and lay it  out in point form. To  our surprise     we  didn't know Sheena  that   well   then        Sheena arrived with a  folder,      containing  pages     of     points,  already itemised, with  tables,diagrams,main  ideas highlighted and  summarised. We were  surprised    on    two  counts:      such      a  systematic,  professional approach  had never been Sinn  Fein's    forte,     and  secondly        Sheena  looked so young, so unassuming, the  'wee girl' from the Ardowen estate  in Craigavon. We quickly realised  we  were  in  the  presence of a  formidable activist.  Sheena went back to study in  1988, in Lurgan Tech' where she  took aGCSE in Sociology. She then  moved to Newry Tech', which now  forms part of the University of  Ulster campuses, to do a two year  foundation course. She was the first  student from Newry to be accepted  into the Law Faculty at Queens,  well-known for the high standards  it demands of entrants. She had been  told by the Careers Guidance people  at Queens that she  hadn'tahope.   The students in her tutorial group  had three and four A's in their 'A'  Levels. Yet they looked up to her to  lead the way in discussions. Sheena  did well in her exams, but spent  nearly as much time helping other  students as with her own work,  forever lending out notes, giving a  hand, encouraging. The teaching  staff recognised this and credited her  with exam successes other than her  own.  A brilliant student, with  tremendous academic ability,  is  how they described Sheena.  She had not decided yet which  aspect of law she would like to  specialise in, but she enjoyed EEC  and constitutional law. Yet she had  no intention of making a money-  spinning career out of it. Alone in  her tutorial group she believed that  law was meant to benefit humanity,  not a lawyer's bank account.  Brendan Curran was shot by  loyalists in October 1989. Sheena  drove to the hospital where she  waited all night outside the  operating theatre, the first to speak  to Brendan when he came to. From  diere she drove on to the Sinn F6in  Advice Centre which she opened,  just like every morning, at 9am.   She would not let them think that  they had broken the back of die  organisation.   Sheena Campbell  Brendan puts his quick recovery  down to her. She got him back on  his feet in weeks, nursed him, drove  him to meetings. When her studies  started to take more of her time,  Brendan becamethehouse-husband,  looking after CaoUn when she went  to lectures, cooking while she  worked on assignments, or relaxed  playing the piano, or read, or played  Scrabble with friends. The games of  Scrabble would last for hours, as she  pondered over triple words. Jim  McAllister and Francie Moiloy  allege she cheated. Of course, they  would   they lost every game.  Go  on Francie, challenge that word.  Sure you have nothing to lose    Sheena's words still ring out  in  Francie's ears as he remembers that  game, which he resoundingly lost.  Many of Sheena's close  comrades became her personal  friends. Visibly shattered last  Sunday, several recalled how  Sheena had helped them through a  bad patch, how you could always  talk to her about anything, political  or personal, how she would read  between tlie tines and in a few words  put a problem in perspective,  managing to tell them if she thought  diey were wrong without causing  offence, a rare friend indeed. The  tears rolling down many people's  cheeks at her graveside last Sunday  told dieir own story.  Sheena packed so much in her 29  years tiiat it is as difficult to  understand why she never saw her  own value and importance, as it is  easy to see why she became a target.  Bom a woman, a nordiem  nationalist, growing into a  republican, she moved out oi the  ghetto oi second-class citizenship, a  croppie who would not lie down. A  mother, a lover, a friend, a comrade,  she will be mourned and missed for  many years to come, yet she will live  on, in die solid foundations that she  built for Sinn Fein activists, in the  memories oi the many that worked  with her, and most of all in the hearts  oi her family and friends.  All we, who are proud to have  been her comrades, can doy is make  sure that the hope she earned, we  carry in our hearts, and that the work  she started is built upon.  Family and Friends  Join Together in Silent Vigil  The parents and sister  of Sheena Campbell,  the Sinn Fein member  murdered by the  loyalist Ulster  Volunteer Force in a  Belfast hotel last  week, joined her  friends in a silent  vigil.  Ms. Campbell was shot  minutes after leaving  Queen's University library to join  friends in the York Hotel on Botanic  Avenue.  Two other people were wounded,  but not seriously injured, when the  loyalist gunman fired at the 29-year-  old mother of one, who was a law  student at the university.  Jean Fegan's eyes filled with  tears as she spoke of her daughter.   She knew her life was in danger but  it did not keep her from her work.  She was aware of the danger but she  was dedicated.   We are very, very proud of our  daughter. It is so sad that the people  who killed her did not have a chance  to talk to her. She would have  listened to their points of view and  argued her own point,  said Mrs.  Fegan.  Craigavon councillor Brendan  Curran, the murdered woman's  boyfriend, was among 25 Sinn Fein  members and councillors from  around the north who attended die  vigil outside the hotel.  Mr. Curran said the aim of the  vigil was to protest at the killing of  partner Brendan Curran looks on as  Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness drape her  coffin with the national nag  Sheena Campbell and other  members of the party.   This vigil is an opportunity for  Sinn Fein to highlight the role of  those who constanUy seek to  marginalize and demonize our party  and by their actions and their words,  create an atmosphere in which  members of Sinn Fein, our families  and supporters, can be targeted for  assassination,  he said.   No other party in Ireland or  Britain has suffered more tiian Sinn  Fein in the last 20 years.   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams  earlier said,  Elements in the media,  die churches, and some political  parties which  demonize  Sinn Fein  cannot escape responsibility for die  murder of Sheena Campbell.*'  The Sinn Fein President, in an  angry statement, spoke about ktiie  consequences of the British efforts  to demonize republicans.   He also said it remained his  conviction that the republican  struggle had the capacity to wear  down and to defeat the British  government.   None of the measures  introduced by tlie British  government, and mis  includes the censorship  laws, have defeated the  republican struggle.  Rather, they have served  only to perpetuate the  conflict with dire  consequences for all  sections of our people and  to add to the burden of  oppression weighted  down upon nationalists  and republicans.   Patrick Mayhew*s attempts to  put on a brave face does nothing to  change this. He himself concedes  that Sinn Fein support remains  significant and solid and all his  predecessors have admitted that the  IRA cannot be defeated. It is only a  matter of time until Mayhew or  Mates is forced to give further  expression to this reality.   They know they cannot win.  Therefore, rather than condemn us  all to further suffering, the London  and Dublin governments should  seek a new agreement to end  partition and to enlist international  assistance to break the deadlock.  This should be die aim also of all  parties claiming to represent  nationalist opinion.   In a tribute to Sheena Campbell  who was murdered at the weekend  by die UVF, Mr. Adams described  her as  a compassionate  Irishwoman, a motiier, a student and  committed Irish republican who  sought a peaceful Ireland which  would reflect the aspirations of all  our people and fulfill their needs.

        <pagetext>OCTOBER 31, 1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  PAGE 10  British Army Sergeant  A sergeant in the Royal Irish  Regiment and formerly an RUC  member was shot dead by the IRA  on Tuesday, October 20th. The man  was killed in Rasharkin in County  Antrim.  The IRA, claiming responsibility for the  shooting, said that they had liad the sergeant  under close observation for a considerable  period of time. The 40-year-old RIR  sergeant was later named as Robert Irvine,  a member of the RUC before joining die  British army.  FURTHER ATTACKS  IN LONDON  Continuing its intensive bombing  campaign in the British capital, the IRA  caused widespread disruption with three  explosives in 1 ,ondon in the past week. The  first two explosions went off in the early  hours of Monday morning, October 19th,  causing extensive damage to a hotel and  city-center bar.  Tlie first device exploded at 12.40 a.m.  outside the Novotel I lotcl in 1 lammersmith,  west London. In this attack, the  Metropolitan police again refused to  evacuate the building despite a clear and  explicit warning from the IRA's active  service unit. Over 6(X) persons were in tlie  hotel when the device exploded and were  described by witnesses afterwards as being  Shocked and disgusted at noi being told by  the London police of the IRA wanting.  In the second attack, a fair in London's  West End was damaged when another  device exploited around 1.30 a.m. The  Comedy bar, and surrounding buildings  near I eu ester Square, were damaged in the  blast. As in the Hammersmith blast, a  warning was relayed to a local radio station.  A worker in anearby cafe, Joseph Latouche,  described the explosion.  There was a big  bang. I thought it must be a big bomb,  because it shook the building, but I heard  later there was only one to one-and-a-half  pounds of explosives.   The IRA statement, issued in Dublin  from die Irish Republican Publicity Bureau  and signed  P, O'NciH , claimed  responsibility for the attacks, saying:   Active service units of die IRA placed  the two devices which exploded in London  in die early hours of yesterday morning.  k'Again with yesterday's blasts, British  police failed to clear target areas in spite of  having received specific warnings  autlienticatedwidirecognizedcodewords.   The IRA said that British police policy  had resulted in recent injuries and in the  tragic deadi of David Heffer. IRA warnings  were not being passed on by police in order  to 'minimize die disruption caused by  bomb and hoax bomb attacks. This policy  should end before there are further tragic  consequences.   On Wednesday, October 21st, at 4.40  p.m., a bomb exploded near Silver Street  British Rail station in North London, The  explosion on the railroad line over the bridge  on die network Southeast line caused severe  disruption to the Liverpool Street lines.  The IRA said diat Constabulary had  earlier failed to act on a warning:    ln spile of repeated phone calls to a  number of London radio static mis. British  police have failed to act on authenticated  warnings that our Volunteers have placed a  bomb on tlie railway line at Four Bridges  on the North Circuhtr Road, London. This  latest incident again underlines the reckless  and cynical policy being pursued by British  officials.   These explosions brought to eleven the  number of bombs detonated in the British  capital in less than two weeks.  CROWN FORCES  PATROLS UNDER FIRE  The IRA's Belfast Brigade have claimed  responsibilty for several operations in the  city which have kept British forces pinned  down and on the move. As Belfast city  center continued to resemble a ancient  fortified city, with thousands of British  crown forces criss-crossing each other*s  patrols, transport and commercial targets  were hit hard.  Saturday, October 10th, saw IRA  Volunteers engaging a British mobile patrol  in the Twinbrook area on the outskirts of  West Belfast. Three British soldiers were  injured when an impact grenade exploded  on top of their armored personnel carrier.  The IRA attack was conducted with  devastating accuracy. This method of attack  has resulted in these British carriers being  fitted with more and more armor to protect  the crews.  The IRA statement continued by giving  details of a gun attack at the crown forces  barracks in the Oldpark Road in north  Belfast on Thursday evening, October 16th.  Before the attack, IRA Volunteers  assembled at a number of positions around  die barracks to wait for a British foot and  mobile patrol which earlier had been  moving through die Ardoyne area. At  approximately 10 p.m., as the enemy forces  approached tlie barracks, two Volunteers  opened up with automatic rifles. At this  point the British mobile patrol raced into the  barracks closely followed by the badly  shaken foot- patrol. There was no return fire,  and all Volunteers withdrew from the  barracks perimeter, evading British  reinforcements moving cautiously into tlie  area  A large hotel at the corner of Botanic  Avenue   and   University   Street   beside  Belfast's 'golden mile' was the target of a  250-lb IRA car bomb in the early hours of  Monday morning, October 19th. IRA  Volunteers in the south of the city loaded  the explosives into the commandeered car  and drove it to the busy road junction, where  it was parked outside the main entrance of  Dukes Hotel. Because it was known that  there were guests staying in the hotel, a 50-  minute warning was given to allow those  inside to be evacuated safely. British army  technical officers later disarmed the  detonating mechanism with two small  explosions.  Rail traffic was seriously disrupted  throughout Monday night and most of  Tuesday, October 2oth, following another  bomb attack in south Belfast. Volunteers  exploded a device on the tine between  Belfast Central and Botanic Stations and  then withdrew from the track. Keeping the  line under observation, the Volunteers  waited for a considerable time for the crown  forces to arrive. When they failed to appear,  the Volunteers dispersed and it was only  with daylight and dozens of foot and mobile  patrols that the British forces moved into  the area.  DUNGANNON  INCENDIARY ATTACKS  Volunteers of Oglaigh na hEireann  operating in the large market town of  Dungannon, County Tyrone, carried out two  commercial bomb attacks on Thursday,  October 8th. The two blasts went off in  Scotch Street, one of the town's main  thoroughfares which runs off the town  square, scene of recent IRA bomb attacks  on the Northern and Ulster Banks and other  commercial premises.  Two blast incendiary bombs were placed  in two shops. Both bombs detonated,  causing   3/4 million pounds worth of  damage. The IRA statement emphasized  that ''despite claims by the SDLP that this  was a sectarian attack, this is not in fact true,  as one of the shops targeted v/as ov/ned by  a Catholic and this was purely a commercial  attack .  IRA Blasts London and Bangor  A massive Irish Republican Army  bomb exploded in the center of  Bangor late last Wednesday, causing  extensive damage in the town.  The Royal Ulster Constabulary admitted  that 20 minutes before the blast the 1R   liad  given a warning to protect civilians  The  warnings were phoned to the Samaritans  and Downtown Radio   No one was hurt,  The device went off in Lower Main Street,  and the sound was heard inoie than 15 miles  away   Hie street is the main commercial  and Shopping center of the town and close  to the the scafioni and the town's manna.  WellwotthS store seemed to have taken  the till  force oi the blast Rubble was  strewn across the street and windows were  broken    all    over    the    town RUC  communication lines were disrupted tor a  tune A fleet oi ambulances and lire engines  were reported to be 00 stand-by, bin they  were not called in The area was sealed off  hv CfOWn forces as bomb disposal experts  checked for further devices the explosion  was die first in tlie loyalist town m 12 years.  London  Meanwhile m London, three bombs,  believed to be part of an IRA campaign,  exploded last Wednesday Hie bombs went  off amid claim and counter-claim between  the Metropolitan constables and the IRA  over the warnings. The IRA holed that its  warnings were being ignored by die Met ami  described    the   constables*    action   as  *reckless,  The Met denied the charge,  though it admitted it had received warnings  trom the (iardai about bombs in the British  Bangor after the IRA strike  capital an hour before a blast at Edmonton.  The IRA statement, issued in Dublin,  Said warnings tad been telephoned to radio  stations an hour before devices were due to  gQ off. but that they had not been acted  upon The 1R A said,  Our volunteers carried  xHit blasts at two locations 00 the London  rail network and at a British army military  base ni I ondon. Attacks such as these will  continue until Britain declares its intention  to withdraw trom northeast Ireland. We  would again under linedie tact demonstrated  by the Ldmonton blast that the British  authorities' policy of ignoring warnings is  thus enefctngering civilian lives.   Scotland Yard said it had received no  such warnings and asked to comment later  would only add,  We are  not prepared to discuss that  at this stage.  At a news  conference later, Scotland  Yard's chief angrily  defended his force's  handling of the Ldmonton  blast claiming constables  could not have acted any  quicker. Commander  George Churchill-Coleman  confirmed that die Gardaf  has passed on a warning  about the bomb.  The Ldmonton blast  happened at about 4:40  p.m., at the height of the  rush      hour. Three  passengers on a passing train were hurt by  debris when  e bomb exploded at a road  overpass, but no one was seriously injured.  The second bomb went off four hours  later. Three persons suffered minor injuries  when it exploded, near the Territorial Army  center in Hammersmith. Soon after that, a  third bomb went off at a railroad line at  Harrow Road in Harlesdcn.  After the Fxlmonton bombing, a two-  mile stretch of the nearby North Circular  Road was closed and several adjoining  Streets sealed off, bringing traffic chaos to  the area.   Rail passengers also suffered  delays when a number of trains were rerouted The British Territorial Army  members were taken to Charing Cross  Hospital after being slighdy hurt in die  Hammersmith explosion. There were no  reports of any casualties in die third blast,  which happened at 9:10 p.m. under Harrow  Road bridge in I Iarlesden High Street.   Two feet of rail is missing, and there is  damage to trie bridge/' said a British Rail  spokesman, adding that no train was on die  track at the time.  Mr. Churchill-Coleman described die  IRA's claim that their bomb warnings had  been ignored as part of a plot to make die  crown look  confused, incompetent arid  inept.  He said that a recognized IRA  codeword had been used on 61 occasions  since last February. Bombs had exploded  22 limes, two others were made safe, and  37 calls were hoaxes.  Each call was  designed to confuse, mislead and disrupt us  here in the capital    The following day, British Prime  Minister John Major said in the House of  Commons that the IRA would be defeated.  He was forced to address the issue.  Responding to a question from Andrew  Hunter, the Conservative MP for  Basingstoke, about the IRA's series of  attacks in Ixmdon, Major said the fight  against die ERA was a priority Major's  comments echoed those of previous British  prime ministers who had failed to de feat the  IRA.

        <pagetext>OCTOBER 31, 1992  THE IRISH PEOPI    PAGE 11  PRONUNCIATION REVIEW  Pronounce an  s  near  a   *o  or  u   like me American sound, with lips relaxed.  This is the broad  s  sound. Do not tense  the lips as in the English sound. Practice on:  si s6, su, saor (say*r), saoi (see),  samhradh (SOU-ruh), saibhir (SEYE-vir),  sac (sank), sabhail (suh-VWAW*-il), slat  (slaht), smal (smaw*l), smaoineamh  (SMWEEN-uhv), smuta (SMUT-uh), snas  (snahs),sp6rt(spohrt),Sp inn(SPAW*-in),  spraoi (spree), stad (stahd), strapa (STRAH-  puh), str6 (stroh).  Pronounce an Irish  s  as (sh) when it  is next to an  e  or an  i , and also when   sc ,  si ,  sn , and  st  are next to the  e   or  i . Examples:s6, sf, sean (shan), seift  (sheft), sin, sceal (shkay*l), slf (shlee),  sneachta (SHNAHK*-tuh), stfl (SHTEEL),  leisce (LESH-ke), uaisle (WISH-le),  misniuil (mish-NYOO-il), 6isteacht  (AY*SH-tyahk*t).  If the combinations  sm ,  sp ,  sr ,  or  str  are next to  e  or  i , pronounce  the  s  as (s), the broad sound described  above. Memorize these examples: smig  (smig), chin; spgir (spay*r), sky; srian  (SREE-uhn), bridle; strfoc (streek), streak,  stripe.   is  is an exception, too. Pronounce it  (is), never (ish) or (iz). Irish has no (z)  sound.  GRAMMAR  In the future tense, the saorbhriathar  (say*r-VREE-huhr) or free form expresses  ideas such as  It will be put on the table  or   Someone will put it on the table . In Irish,  diis is:  Cuirfear ar an mbord 6 (KIR-fuhr er un  MOHRD ay*). Note that the V is  pronounced (0 here. In other future forms,  you pronounce it (h), as in  Cuirfidh m    (KIR-hee may*) ar an mbord 6:; I will place  it on the table.  The rest of the saorbhriathar forms in the  future are:  Nf chuirfear (K*IR-fuhr) ar an mbord 6.  An gcuirfear (un GIR-fulir) ar an mbord   ?  Nach gcuirfear (nach* GIR-fuhr) ar an  mbord 6?   Ni aspirates here,and  an  and  nach   eclipse.  For a two-syllabled second-conjunction  verb, such as  ceannaigh  (KAN-ee), buy,  the future forms are:  Ceann6far 6 (kan-OH-fuhr ay*), it will be  bought.  Nf cheann6far 6 (nee hyan-OH-fuhr ay*),  it will not be bought.  An gceann6far 61 (un gyan-OH-fuhr ay*),  will it be bought?  Nach gceann6far 6? (nahk* gyan-OH-fuhr  ay*), won't someone buy it?  Others from this group:  Oscl6far 6 (ohsk-LOH-fuhray*), someone  will open it.  Cosn6far 6 (kuhs-NOH-fuhr ay*), it will be  defended.  Freag6far 6 (frag-ROH-fulir ay*), someone  will answer it.  Baileofar 6 (balil-YOH-fuhray*), someone  will collect it.  Inseofar d6 6 (in-SHOH-fulir doh ay*), it  will be told to him.  Notice that an extra  e  is inserted  sometimes. This makes spelling consistent  so diat you know whether a letter gets its  broad or slender sound. For example,  without the V to help, you would not know  whether  insofar  was (in-SOH-fuhr)or(in-  SHOH-fulir).  DRILL  With die examples:  An gcuirfear an mala sa charr? (un  GIR-fuhr un MAW*-lali suli K* AHR), Will  the bag be put into the car? Nf chuirfear an  mala sa charr, The bag wont be put into  the car. Nach gcuirfear an mala sa charr?  Cuirfear an mala sa charr.  Go through progressive drills with  diese word groups:  Bris (brish), break; an cupan ar an urlar,  the cup on die floor.  Feic (fek), see; an cailfn sin amarach  (uh-MAW*-rahk*), that girl tomorrow.  P6s (pons), marry; Sean le Sfle (SI DEE-  lull).  Crfochnaigh (KRJtE-uhk*-nee), finish;  an obair seo, diis work.  Mfnigh (MEEN-ee), explain; an fhadhb  (eyeb), the problem.  Key: An mbrisfear an cupan ar an urlar?  Nf bhrisfear . Nach mbrisfear    ? Brisfear .  An bhfeicfear (VHK-fuhr) ? Nf  fheicfear (nee H-fuhr)  .  Nach  bhfeicfear ? Feicfear .  An gcriochnofar (greek*-NOH-fuhr)     ? Nf chrfochn6far . Nach  gcrfochn6far ? Crfochnofar -.  An mfneofar ?

His main  objects were to bring the country  under the complete subjugation of  the English Parliament, to confiscate  and redistribute land under the  Adventurers Act of 1642, and to seek  retribution for the deaths of  Protestant settlers which were  alleged to have taken place during  the Rising of 1641. The campaign  of genocide planned by this  exemplar of human cruelty is too  terrible to describe, and candid  expression cannot find words  suitable for even everyday circles.  Cromwell advanced swiftly. He  marched north and stormed the town  of Drogheda, where in a general  massacre some 3,500 persons were  put to the sword.  Three months after the coming of  Cromwell, the great Irish general  Owen Roe O' Neill was poisoned and  died at Cloughoughton Castle in  Cavan. This exposed all Ireland to  the English Attila, who coldly told  his soldiers,  Nits will never be lice,   to justify  the  slaughter  of Irish  infants.  After Drogheda, Cromwell turned  and swept southward to Wexford. Two  thousand were butchered there.  Lingard, in his history of England, says:   Wexford was abandoned to the mercy  of the assailants. No distinction was  made between the defenseless  inhabitants and the armed soldiers, nor  could the shrieks and prayers of three  hundred females who had gathered  round the great cross in the marketplace  preserve them from the swords of these  ruthless barbarians.   No more illuminating light could be  thrown upon the extraordinary attitude  of Britain toward Ireland, through all the  centuries, than the sentiments of the  great Englishman Carlyle upon the  coldest-blooded butcher of all the  butchers by whom Ireland has been  afflicted throughout the centuries.   Oliver Cromwell came as a soldier  of God the just, terrible as death,  relentless as doom, doing God's  judgments on the enemies of God... It  was the first King's face that poor  Ireland ever saw, the first friend's face.   Since this was the attitude of the  masses of the English people, there is  no reason for being surprised at the  attitude toward Ireland of the mass of  the British people.  They knelt around the cross divine  Tlie matron and the maid;  They bowed before Redemption's sign,  And fervently they prayed;  Three hundred fair and helpless ones,  Whose crime was this alone-  Their valiant husbands, sires and sons  Had battled for their own.  Had battled bravely, but in vain-  The Saxon won the fight;  The Irish corpses strewed the plain  Where Valour slept with Right.  And now that man of demon guilt  To fated Wexford flew-  The red blood reeking on his hilt,  Of hearts to Erin true.  He found them there-the young, the  old,  The maiden, and the wife;  Their guardians brave in death were  cold  Who dared for them the strife.  They prayed for mercy-God on  high   Before Thy cross they prayed,  And ruthless Cromwell bade them  die  To glut the Saxon blade   Three hundred fell-the stifled prayer  Was quenched in woman's blood;  Nor youth nor age could move to  spare  Erom slaughter's crimson flood.  But nations kept a stern account  Of deeds that tyrants do;  And guiltless blood to Heaven will  mount  And Heaven avenge it, too   SHANNON TRAVEL SERVICE INC.

        <pagetext>OCTOBER 31,1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  PAGE 13  Fury Over Mandela IRA Comments on British Television  A storm of controversy has arisen  after African National Congress  leader Nelson Mandela, in an  interview broadcast on British  television, described the Irish  Republican Army as being engaged  in a fight against colonialism by a  foreign country  So embarrassing were the  comments that the Dublin government's  Foreign Minister David Andrews has been  urged to devote his upcoming visit to South  Africa to challenging Nelson Mandela to  withdraw his comments. Tlie ANC  defended Mandela but, mindful of the  support which it receives from a wide range  of Irish, including government officials and  public celebrities opposed to tlie IRA,  issued a statement that Mr. Mandela's  statements  cannot be construed as support  for the IRA.   The controversy began when Mr.  Mandela was interviewed by rock star  turned TV talk show host Bob Geldof.  Geldof, a vocal critic of die IRA and  heretofore an ardent admirer of the ANC  leader, was visibly angered when his guest  said that  The IRA are conducting a struggle  for self-assertion. They do not want Britain,  a foreign country, to run a country.   Geldof angrily voiced his  objections to Mandela's statement, saying  that  But a majority of our people do.   Mandela, who had served 27 years in the  Nelson Mandela  maximum-security prison at Robben Island  for his leadership role in attempting to  organize a military overthrow of tlie  apartheid regime, responded that  There are  large numbers of people who do not believe  in what wc say. Nevertheless, we're  convinced that what we are saying i s correct.  Catholics now make up more than 40  percent of northeast Ireland population     even though official figures at first seem to  indicate otherwise.  When those who failed to respond to a  census question about religion are taken into  account, Catholics appear certain to make  up more than two fifths of the people living  in northeast Ireland.  Published last week, the 1991  census summary report puts the Catholic  population at 606,639, or 38.4 percent. In  1981, 414,532 stated their religion as  Catholic. The 1991 report shows in  northeast Ireland there are 336,891  Presbyterians, 279,280 people belonging to  the Church of Ireland and 59,517  Methodists. Those figures represent a fall,  by some 8,000-in the number of  Presbyterians since 1981, but slight  increases in the number of followers of the  Church of England and Methodists.  Of the 122,448 people in die 1991 report  who said they belong to other  denominations, 19484 are Baptist, 12,446  Brethren, 12,386 Protestant and 12,363 Free  Presbyterian Church of Ulster. For tlie first  time there was an opportunity for people to  say they belonged to no religion   59,234  did so.  Although totals, as expected, show no  dramatic change since the last census a  decade ago, it would now seem the number  of Catholics has edged above the 40 percent  mark.  Some politicians have traditionally  looked at that figure as a significant  benchmark in terms of predicting a shift in  the religious balance within Northern  Ireland.  Any startling change, however,  would appear highly  unlikely given a  general trend in Ireland towards a decline  in Catholic family size. Due to this factor,  and others, experts have in the past ruled  out pronounced increases and decreases in  the overall population, or in the numbers  belonging to any particular religion.  Applying a formula used to codify people  who did not state their religion in returns,  tlie Catholic population in January 1981 was  out somewhere between 38.5 and 39.2  percent.  Problems in calculating 1981 returns  were compounded by a boycott is support  of republican prisoners in the H-Blocks and  that year's hunger strike. A census taker was  shot dead in Derry.  Demographic experts who studied the  1971 figures, when there was also an anti-  census protest, estimated about 57 percent  of those who did not state their religion were  Catholics.  Applying their formula in 198 would  have put the Catholic population between  517,026and589,026.Thefigurespubiished  showed 114,827 people   7.8 percent of the  population   did not respond to the religion  question.  ExacUy how many of those are Catholic  is difficult to determine.  In 198, some 275,000 people     18.5 percent of the population   refused to  answer the question about religion. In 1971,  9.4 percent did not return the forms.  A key figure not included in the  summary concerns the birth rates of those  belonging to a particular religion. Generally  regarded as a more accurate indicator of the  long term balance it will be dealt with in a  report relating specifically to Northern  Ireland's religious composition due to be  published in 1993.  We don't want any form of  colonialism, and wherever it is, we  support those who fight it. People  I have a right to self-expression.   I When Geldof raised thequestionot  innoeenteivilians getting caught up  in the campaign, Mandela replied  that  In any conflict, some people  will be hit by crossfire. It has  happened throughout history.   The interview unleashed  a wave of criticism from public  figures, including those who in the  very recent past were only ioo  happy to jump on the bandwagon  to praise the 76-year-old leader tor  his lifelong struggle against  apartheid. Establishment  politicians attempted to limit the  influence of Mr. Mandela's  comments without appearing to  being too critical of Mr. Mandela  personally but ended up insulting  or patronizing him. Most tried to  take tlie view that Mandela is in  some way ignorant about the  situation in Ireland.  For example, Dublin mayorGay  Mitchell described Mr. Mandela,  who was granted tlie Freedom of the City  of Dublin, as  misinformed and arrogant.   He urged Dublin Foreign Minister David  Andrews to confront Mandela directly  during an upcoming visit to South Africa.  Proinsias De Rossa said that Mandela was   dangerously     misinformed,  The  condemnations echo similar reactions from  the same sources last year when in Dublin  Mandela urged dialog including the 1R An gt;  bring tlie conflict in tlie North to a peaceful  resolution.  Mandela's comments come  against a background of longstanding  revelations that the South African  intelligence services have been supplying  weapons to various loyalist paramilitary  gangs, especially the Ulster Volunteer Force  (UVF), and had contracted out to a loyalist  hit squad an assassination attempt on a  South African dissident living in England.  Mandela's comments have a  political as well as practical basis. It is well  known  that    the loyalist political and  paramilitary groups identify with tlie  apartheid South African regime as sharing  a similar  white man's burden  in struggling  to hold off the restless  native  population.  On tlie other hand, the Republican  movement has in iLs public statements, its  publications, and even in a number of  prominent wall murals throughout the  North, voiced its support for Mandela and  the antiapartheid cause.  The controversy was further fueled  by the comments of recently released ANC  member Robert McBride. His release from  a South African prison was part of an  amnesty grudgingly granted by the Pretoria  regime in an attempt to revive (lagging  negotiations with the ANC. Mc Bride,  whose great-grandfather, Major John  McBride, was executed by the British in the  aftermath of the 1916 Easter Rising,  commented at length on his involvement in  Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the military  wing of the ANC.  When questioned about the ANC  campaign, McBride said that whatever tlie  moral qualms might be about such a  strategy, 'The original sin is with apartheid.  If there were no apartheid, there would be  no Umkhonto we Sizwe. Let's go to the  source, not the byproduct. Whenever there  is conflict, you have negative spinoffs.   Mayor Mitchell, who demand that the Irish  AntiApariheul Movement should  put Mr.  Mandela right'1 and  reassure the people  here   m Ireland) that the ANC  is not an IRA-  type campaign,  will first have to explain  the difference he sees is McBride's  statement and the similar explanation given  by   IRA   Spokespersons   for   the   armed  struggle in Ireland.  The freedom fighter and great-  grandson of a freedom fighter called on the  British government to negotiate with tlie  IRA and added,  I have become almost  obsessed with Ireland and Irish history and  especially the struggle for freedom. The  determination of the Irish people to be free  from so many years of oppression is  something I look up to. It's something I  admire in the Irish people   the tenacity of  the Irish people to stand up even against the  greatest odds.  McBride has expressed a  strong desire to visit Ireland.

        <pagetext>OCTOBER 31, 1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  PAGE 14  Loyalist Threats Fail to Shut Down Sunday Newspaper  A newspaper under loyalist threat  will publish as usual this week.  Rumors within the industry had  suggested that the Sunday World could  face closure because ot Ulster  Volunteer Force threats, but these were  dismissed by a reliable source.  The staff at the newspaper had been  ordered by Dublin-based management not  to talk to other reporters about die situation  at die office. It climaxed last week in a UVF  bid to bomb the High Street premises and a  subsequent threat from die organization  against its staff and distributors. Now it is  thought that publication of die newspaper     which has run investigative stories about  both loyalist and republican  paramilitaries   will proceed as usual.  It is understood that management had  discussions with the staff shortly after one  Of the biggest demonstrations by northeast  Ireland journalists in recent years.  Representatives from almost every media  Loyalists  outiet in Belfast took part  in the demonstration  outside the newspaper's  offices at lunchtime to  highlight opposition to  the attempted  intimidation of  colleagues. Attended by  several senior union  officials, including  National Union of  Journalists' deputy  general secretary Jake  Ecclestone, it also had  the support of other  union groups and  political parties.  Before taking part in  the protest, which was  attended by more than 50  representatives of print  andbroadcastmedia, Mr.  Ecclestone said reporters  on the paper have the  M  rkino    of   journalists  .  everywhere  because we believe that  freedom of expression, of ideas and  opinions is fundamental to a civilized and  democratic society.  He said that the attempt  to  censor the press by violence   demonstrated two things about the UVF.   First, they have no arguments or ideas  except the bomb and the gun; second, that  they hold the people of northeast Ireland in  contempt.   He added,  Censorship is an expression  of fear, and journalists in northeast Ireland  have struggled over many years to conquer  this fear. They will not be defeated now.   Mr. Ecclestone told the UVF,  If you don't  like the Sunday World, organize a peaceful  boycott. You don't do it by guns and  bombs.   National executive member representing  northeast Ireland journalists, Kevin Cooper,  said that die UVF and Combined Loyalist  Military Command's statement was as  much an attack on the democratic right of  the unionist community to read the  newspaper of their choice as it was an attack  on free speech and press freedom.  Two Tyrone Men Jailed by Dublin Court for Attempted Murder  Two Tyrone men were sentenced to  twelve years at the Special ( Timinal Court  in Dublin for the  attempted murder of an  Ulster Defence  Regiment        (til)k)  soldier near the border  last February despite  the tact that the UDR  tfOOper's account was  contradicted by a  British forensic expert  and by his earlier  statements.  James Hughes and  Conor O'Neill were  convicted in the case  The      incident      had  occurred at  Scardans  Upper, Bcllcek,  Fermanagh, on  February 5th. The men  were also given  concurrent 12-vcar  sentences for having  firearms with intent to  Former British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher reviewing the  I fitter Defence Regiment  endanger life at Helleek and 10 years for  having two Kalashnikov rifles, a revolver  and ammunition in  Donegal on the same  date. The court made  DO finding on a further  charge of shooting at  the trooper witii intent  to cause grievous  bodily harm.  Mr. Hughes (28),  and Mr. O'Neill (27),  both from Dungannon,  Tyrone, but with an  address at Westport,  Ballyshannon,  Donegal, had denied  all charges.  The trial was under  die 1976 Criminal  Law Jurisdiction Act,  which allows for  suspects to be tried in  the south for offenses  allegedly committed  in northeast Ireland.  The court was told during the nine-day trial  that Mr. Glass (49), a Fermanagh dog  warden and UDR corporal, was lured into  an IRA ambush at a remote farm one and a  half miles from die border. The trooper shot  dead an IRA man, Joseph MacManus (21),  widi his personal-issue pistol and forced  others to flee. He was injured in both legs  after he was hit by seven bullets and is still  on crutches. The accused men were arrested  shortly alter the incident by gardai who  found them in a ditch close to the border in  Donegal. Two Kalashnikov rifles and a  revolver were found some time later.  Sentencing the men, Justice Barr,  presiding, said that die court was satisfied  that die probably primary objective of die  men was to hijack the trooper's van. Tlie  court was aJ so satisfied tiiat both the accused  men were part of an IRA squad. The judge  said it was likely that the plan was to hijack  the van, that the men did not know Glass  was a UDR member and armed, and that  his response in killing MacManus  came as  a complete surprise.  He said the court did  not accept Glass's account of what  happened and it was likely that he fired first.  Glass's initial account to the RUC was  unreliable.  The judge said the court had taken into  account the age of the accused men and die  fact that neither of them had previous  convictions.  They have been brought up  in northeast Ireland at a time of much strife  and inter-community tension and violence  there, which may well have had some  bearing on the formation of their  characters,  he added.  TOP GARDA WAS  BRITISH AGENT, SAYS MI6 MAN                           a  LIAM RYAN  Third Anniversary Memorial Mass  Will Be Held At  Visitation Parish  160 Van Cortland Park South  near 240th St and Broadway  Saturday, November 28th, 7:30pm  Sponsored by Irish Northern Aid  Social to follow at Jesse James Tavern  Liam Ryan's favorite pub  236 Street and Broadway, Bronx, NY  For Information call 212 736 1916  A former British intelligence agent  has claimed there were pro and anti-  IRA factions within the Garda. Fred  Holyrod, who worked as a military  intelligence officer with MI6 in  Ireland in the 1970 s.  I got the  impression from them that there was  a lot of suspicion around, that even  within the gardai there were two  factions, those who were anti-IRA  and those who were pro-IRA, ki he  said.  The late Ned Gavery's period as  Garda Commissioner was one of the most  controversial in the history of the Garai and  he was ultimately sacked by Fianna Fail in  1()77. During 1975and 1976 allegations that  suspects were being beaten in Gardastations  began to emerge and a number of gardai  have since claimed a  heavy gang  existed  within die force.  He had recruited Garvey in the  mid-70's when he was the second most  senior Garda official in Dublin, Holyrod  said. Before he was promoted by the Fine  Gael government to Garda Commissioner  in 1975. Garvey was head of C3, the  intelligence unit of the Garda.  The former MI6 agent said he had  a Garda officer operating in the border area  in the mid-70's under the codename  The  Badger , and had been in contact with other  gardai in the South.  It was clear they had  authority from high up , he said.  I was  asked by some of the gardai to go down to  Dublin and I agreed. I was taken to the  Phoenix Park and introduced Garvey.   There was another man present at  that meeting who, Holyrod said, he  understood to be a senior army officer.   They made it clear that they wanted to pass  on information to the British,  he said. After  being shown an IRA arms factory which had  been discovered in Donabate, near Dublin,  he was asked to trace the British machinery  used in that factory.  Holyrod said Garvey had supplied  him with 150 photos had files on IRSP  members which he brought back to his  controller. He had made arrangements with  Garvey to meet on a monthly basis.  But Garvey  told me to be careful  who I talked to in the forensic laboratory   and named one person whom be should not  talk to.  ////  Voice of Irish Repi hlicasism is America  v*

        <pagetext>OCTOBER 31, 1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  IT'S NOVEMBER-TIME TO REMEMBER    George Bush in the middle of the night sent Joe Doherty back in  chains to British-occupied Northeast Ireland.  George Bush sent the American-born citizen Liam  Quinn to England to face the same legal system  that wrongfully jailed the Guildford Four, the  Winchester Three, Judith Ward and the  Birmingham Six for seventeen years.  George Bush forced American citizen Liam Ryan,  a supporter of Irish freedom, back to his  assassination by British murder squads.  George Bush's federal agents have continuously  arrested and harassed Irish activists at the behest  of the British Government, such as  Gerry McGeough  Colum Meehan  Eamon Meehan  Gabriel Megahey  Francis Gildernew  Jim Barr  Sean Mackin  Philomena Mackin  George Bush's Justice Department has  imprisoned supporters of Irish freedom, such as  The Boston Three  The Florida Four  The New York Five  After the Irish beat George Bush in open court, he went behind closed doors and  stripped away from the Irish the time-honored American tradition of protecting political exiles.  George Bush says that when it comes to political the  Irish need not apply .  George Bush refuses to allow Irish their First Amendment rights by denying Gerry Adams  and other Sinn Fein members a visa to speak to the American people.  Now George Bush wants to send Jim Smyth and Kevin Barry Artt  to join Joe Doherty in a Northeast Ireland prison.  We urge all the 44 million Irish Americans to  vote for Bill Clinton who has promised that  there will be no more Joe Doherty's.

        <pagetext>Senior UUP member in  electoral corruption probe.  Page 7  Sinn Fein opposes  GM in Ireland  Page 14  *****************************AUT0**3-DIGIT  070  l    ,      ,   l   lm,ll..ll...ll.mll..llmlilillmll..l  PEOPLE  Ism in America  S.95  By  Gerry Coleman, Political  Education Director  Irish Northern Aid Committee  There are many perplexing questions  that Irish America needs answers to with  regards the arrest on 17 July and the deportation the next day of John McNicholl of  Philadelphia.  Exactly what was the bureaucratic or  political decision process in operation at  INS and within the Bush administration  that lead to John McNicholl's arrest: a  dedicated, loving family man with a wife  and three children who are American citizens; a twenty year resident of  Philadelphia and a taxpaying, union pipe  fitter; a solid, law-abiding citizen and  active in the Irish American community -  John was a past president of  Philadelphia's Derry Society.  Was the decision fair? Was it implemented in a judicious manner? Was the  physical arrest and speed with which the  deportation took place cruel and unusual?  Are Irish people from the north who participated in the conflict on the republican  side being targeted for deportation despite  the GFA? Exactly who or what office  made this decision?  The final question is a broader one. Is  America a safer place today as a result of  having John McNicholl ripped from his  home and deported; and his wife and his  three children forced to leave this county?  We can speculate about the answers to  the first group of questions. My belief is  that, from the surface of the facts that we  have, the nature of the decision to deport  Mr. McNicholl was unfair and prejudiced;  and the nature of the physical event of his  deportation was cruel and unusual.  But I know for sure, and so do all  those that know the McNicholl family or  families like the McNicholls, that America  is a weaker, sadder country without them.  I also fear for all of our freedoms and for  the course of justice if this is indicative of  a new America.  These are the facts:  1  John McNicholl was  arrested  by  the Immigration and Naturalization  Service at 5:30 a.m., July 17, as he left his  Philadelphia home for work. Sean, his 18-  year-old son who witnessed the event, said  his father was  kidnapped by strange men  ...and bundled into an unmarked car.  The  young man ran after the car in vain. The  younger children suffer nightmares of  being kidnapped and taken away. Mr.  McNicholl was deported in shackles the  next day after being allowed 30 minutes  with his wife Frankie.  2  John McNicholl was charged with  killing an RUC man, but escaped from  Long Kesh while awaiting trial by a jury-  less, special military-style court. He and  Frankie came to the US in 1984 and  immediately went to work making a life  and raising a family.  3  Mr. McNicholl was charged by  immigration officials of entering this  country illegally and lying concerning his  arrest on his visa application.  A Bureau of Immigration and  Customs enforcement officer said that Mr.  McNicholl  went through the whole  process and was denied his last appeal.   The Board of Appeals issued a deportation  order on 10 July and it was enforced on 17  July, the day the stunned family lawyer,  James Orlow, had filled an appeal on the  first decision.  4  The US Department of Homeland  Security Bureau of Immigration and  Customs Enforcement stated on 21 July  that Mr. McNicholl was  a suspected  member of the INLA, a terrorist organization in Ireland.   If this is the cause for the deportation,  it is a curious one. The INLA has not been  on the US State Department's Terrorist  Organization list since they went on  ceasefire  in   1998  after the  GFA was                                111  signed. Who or what made the decision to  take action against groups not on the State  Department list? Why?  6  The Irish platform that President  Bush ran under states,  In the spirit of that  healing document  the GFA  we call for a  review of issues of deportation and extradition arising prior to the accord.   The offenses that Mr. McNicholl was  accused, but never convicted of, took  place almost thirty years ago in the 1970s.  What is going on here?  Have your senators and members of  congress find out exactly what the administration, the INS, the Department of  Homeland Security is up to. They and we  need to have answers and then we need  justice, not only for the McNicholls, but  also for those that will surely follow.  Concern for new US/UK Extradition  Treaty  We are also distressed by the implications of the proposed, new US/UK  Supplemental Extradition Treaty. This  treaty must not be pushed or bullied  through without thorough debate. Ask  your Senators to put a hold on this treaty  until it can be fully assessed.  All senators can be accessed through  the congressional switchboard 202-225-  3121.  The three Irishmen on trial in  Colombia made a surprise appearance in  court for the first time in their trial on  Wednesday as the lengthy proceedings  draw to a close.  They vehemently protested their innocence of training FARC guerillas, reasserting their position that they had been in  Colombia, like many other international  visitors, to observe the peace process. The  men singled out the British and US  embassies in Bogota for special criticism,  accusing them of spreading misinformation  about them from the outset.  The previous day, the head of  Colombia's armed forces, in what the men's  supporters believe is part of an ongoing  campaign by Colombia's political and mili-  We're innocent  Colombia accused testify in court  tary establishment to put  pressure on the  trial judge,  publicly called  for their conviction.  N i a 1 1  Connolly,  Martin  McCauley and Jim Monaghan have been  charged with the use of false public documentation and training the FARC. They  have been in custody for nearly two years.  5**  The trial began  on 4 October  last and since  it began it has  stopped and  started seven  times.  Following  the summing  up by the prosecution on Monday, each of the men made  statements to the court on Wednesday. The  defense will begin its summation on  Thursday.  Caitriona Ruane of the Bring Them  Home Campaign said:  Niall Connolly,  Martin McCauley and Jim Monaghan have  taken the opportunity to give their version  of events and come to the court. We are  calling on the Colombian government to  rein in their military now and to stop their  attempts to intimidate the judge. There is no  evidence in this case, the military know it,  the prosecutor knows it, the Colombian  government knows it and the world knows  it.   The Colombian authorities should  send these men home to their families. The  Irish government should be calling for the  release of the men. This is a farcical show  trial.

        <pagetext>Pace 2  The Irish People  August 9 - August 15, 2003  NEWS BRIEFS  These news items were compiled from a variety of sources.  British Army flies UVF flag  Sinn Fein councilor Pat McGinn has accused the British Army of glorifying loyalist violence after it was discovered that a UVF flag was hoisted on a stanchion supporting a military spy camera at one of the North's  largest British Army bases in Bessbrook in South Armagh.  According to McGinn,  the UVF flag appeared on the British Army  base in Besshrook. It is attached to one of the stanchions used to support  spy cameras at the base and it must be stressed that this flag is in such a  position that the only people who could have erected it were those inside  the base .  McGinn called on NIO Security Minister Jane Kennedy to  publicly  explain why this Hag has been erected and by who and why it has not been  removed.   Wc have known for many years that the British state forces have  shared information, weapons and membership with unionist paramilitaries.  It is, however, unusual for such a public display of collusion to be put on  display.   Taylor threatens to scupper Agreement  Leading Ulster Unionist John Taylor has threatened to scupper the  entire Good Friday Agreement if the proposed Independent Monitoring  Body (1MB) will include a nominee from the Dublin government.  UUP leader David Trimble has championed the establishment of the  1MB and nationalists have seen its establishment as another sop by the  British government to rejectionist unionism. But, as with other concessions, as soon as they get their cake, unionists want to cat it as well.  With two British to the Irish government's single nominee, the British  government is set to exercise complete control over the actions of the 1MB.  Furthermore, the body must report directly to the NIO Secretary of State  who has ultimate power to decide to act or ignore its recommendations.  The 1MB is a discriminatory, anti-democratic mechanism, designed to  place further burdens on the nationalist electorate in exercising their right  to democratic representation. But recent unionist opposition to the 1MB has  nothing to do with this; on the contrary, unionist objection is based on  opposition to even the appearance of a nationalist dimension within the  1MB.  Writing in the London Times, Taylor said he would  probably  vote  against the sanctions body and warned that it could undermine any unionist support lor I lie GFA. He went on to say that the proposal that the Dublin  government should nominate a representative to the new body would not  win the support of ordinary unionists. Jeffcry Donaldson has also claimed  that the participation of an Irish government nominee in any monitoring  idle of the StOrmonl Assembly represents a fundamental breach of unionist  principles.  Adams calls for election date on US visit  Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams MP arrived in New York on Tuesday  night, where he continued to press the message that the British government   has to set a date certain for the elections .  The Sinn Fein President told a meeting  not only is this a matter of  political principle but I believe Mr. Blair can be persuaded to go ahead with  the elections if US opinion joins the growing lobby in Ireland demanding  that this should happen .  Adams left Boston after briefing a Massachusetts Congressional delegation on the current state of the political process. This two-hour meeting  with the delegation led by Congressman Richard Ncal and which included  Congressman Jim McGovcrn, Congressman Stephen Lynch and  Congressman John Tierney, also focused on the very important issue of collusion.  In Boston, Adams had addressed the Irish American Partnership  luncheon. The event, attended by over 300 people, raises funds for the Irish  American Partnership, which provides financial support to community and  educational projects in Ireland.  On Monday, after a one-hour meting with fed Kennedy in his Boston  office, the Sinn Fein president welcomed the US Senator's forthright support for the holding ol'elections in the Six Counties.  Adams was due lo meet The National Council on American Foreign  Policy's Bill Flynn in New York yesterday, lie will meet with US Special  Envoy to Ireland, Richard Haass today, Thursday, when he is expected to  put the case strongly that the US do all in its power to ensure that the  Assembly elections go ahead.  Sectarian  intimidation drives  Catholics out  BY LAURA FRIEL  For many years, Antrim was used by the statutory agencies as a dumping ground for anti-social elements excluded from housing in Belfast. A few years  ago, drug dealers, armed, ruthless and apparently  beyond the law, had held sway, intimidating families  and frequently forcing them out.  Aine Gribbon had been one of many women  who had successfully campaigned to reclaim the  estate from criminal intimidation. But now Aine, like  many other families within this community, is facing  another kind of threat. Last week, the PSNI visited  Aine to inform her that her life, and the lives of other  prominent local activists, was in imminent danger  from loyalist paramilitaries.  The PSNI officer who informed the Gribbon  family of this death threat was very clear about its  source. There was a new UDA leader in Antrim and  he intended to kill a number of local republicans to  enhance his standing within the loyalist community.  But in the back living room of her home, Aine was  not preoccupied with the threat against her life but  the plight of other members of her community.   It was around 10.30pm on Saturday night,  said  Aine,  when about 40 loyalists, mostly men and  dressed in black attacked a row of six houses .  A few hundred yards from Aine's home, at the  bottom end of a large green, six houses occupied by  Catholic families in the Stiles estate came under  attack. A couple living in one of the houses described  all the front windows, upstairs and down, coming in  around them simultaneously and with such force that  the shattered glass covered the rooms.  Aine had been one of a number of local residents  to run across the playing field to the scene of the  attack.  There was a whole crowd of loyalists and  only two PSNI officers,  said Aine.  Later, a CID officer told a resident that the PSNI  weren't sure that the attack had been sectarian  because some of the families whose homes had been  targeted were mixed marriages. The loyalist mob  returned on Sunday night and launched an attack on  a number of other Catholic homes in the area.  During last year's Orange marching season, over  60 Catholic families were forced to flee following  loyalist intimidation in Antrim. Having successfully  driven many Catholics away from the adjacent  Steeples and Park Hall estates, loyalists now appear  intent on extending their control in the Stiles area.  Local Sinn Fein Councilor Martin McManus  says the media portrayal of what is currently occurring in Antrim as 'tit-for-tat' inter-community strife is  not only misleading but also adds to the plight of  those targeted for intimidation.   We are witnessing loyalist paramilitaries intent  on creating a divided community by driving  Catholics out of a mixed area,  he said.  To describe  that process as 'tit-for-tat' is a dangerous nonsense  and buys into the loyalist agenda of making it impossible for Protestants and Catholics to live peacefully  within integrated housing.   It is a matter of personal pride, that I can tell  you that during a period of intense provocation, in  which over 300 Catholics have been rendered homeless by loyalist intimidation, not one single Protestant  has been intimidated out of this estate. Sectarian  retaliation is not an option here; loyalism may thrive  on division but republicans are intent upon building  a society of equals.

        <pagetext>August 9 - August 15, 2003  The Irish People  Paee 3  Official  Statement from  John McNicholl's  family  The following statement was delivered by Sean McNicholl, 18, eldest son of  John McNicholl on behalf of his family.  Issued July 23, 2003 through the  Federation of Irish American Societies of  the Delaware Valley.  I witnessed my father being kidnapped by strange men from our front  door and bundled into an unmarked car. I  ran down the street after the car but could  not catch up to it. I later found out that  these people were representatives of the  United States Government.  I am in high school. I am a citizen of  the United States. I was born and raised in  this neighborhood, in Upper Darby. This is  my home. My friends are here; this is my  country;  my younger brother and sister and my  mother are United States citizens.  Can someone from the Bush  Administration explain what we are to do,  now that they have deported our father?  Where is the justice, in the justice dept of  the US for my family and me?  Who do they expect to help us? Will  the Attorney General send a check every  week to pay our bills - my little sister's  dental bills, for example?  My father provided for my family,  and me, he is a good father. My mother  and my father have lived in this community for many years. My father has lived as  a man of peace showing kindness to and  support for all around him. We don't  understand why our government would  crush our family and leave us so broken.  My brother and sister and I had dreams of  living our lives here in the United States  with the support of both our parents. Now  we have nightmares, my little sister wakes  up screaming, she thinks men will come  back and harm us and take us away.  I was considering joining the US military after this year, my last year in high  school. My younger brother Conall also  was thinking about a military career.  We are Americans; we still cannot  comprehend what has happened to us and  to our dad. We feel so violated, so let  down, so scared and traumatized by the  actions of our government.  Are we left no choice other than  forced exile from our country, the United  States?  We hear Mom crying in her room and  we know she is scared and worried about  dad, and all of us, and what are we all  going to do.  On Thursday morning my mother  called Immigration Deportation Dept, in  Philadelphia, the lady who answered the  phone acted as if they knew nothing about  him. Mom then called Immigration Dept,  in York on Friday morning; they presented  Dad to her in shackles - my dad, who  peaceably went to work every day in  Philadelphia for years and had to renew  his work authorization at the Immigration  Office in Philadelphia every 90 days.  Our dad explained to us the harassment his family suffered at the hands of  the Royal Ulster Constabulary, a police  force, more like a militia, who only protected the interests of the loyalist and  unionist community. The British  Government has since disbanded this  group because of the abuse they leveled at  the nationalist community. They are  known to have colluded with loyalists in  the murder of nationalists and particularly  human rights lawyers. Dad told us how the  RUC would harass his parents by breaking  into their home and entering their bedrooms in the middle of the night at gunpoint. They would utter disparaging  remarks about his elderly mother, my  grandmother, in her nightgown and would  compare her to an old Fenian cow and  other crude remarks.  Dad was a member of the Northern  Ireland Civil Rights Association, an  organization that worked for equality  issues for the Nationalist community.  Aren't civil rights something worth  achieving and defending? The RUC were  intent on framing my father, so they said  he was involved in terrorist activity and  planted weapons where they arrested him.  My father escaped from the prison to  which he was taken, because he knew that,  like so many others in Northern Ireland  back then, they would have imprisoned  him for most of his life for something he  didn't do.  The RUC were invited by the US  Dept of Justice to come to my father's trial  in Philadelphia. Their testimony should  not have been believed. This group includ-  continucd on page 5  Appeal on behalf  of the  McNicholl family  The family needs funds and  they need it quickly. They are  trying to get John back and  know it's a slim chance. They  also have to get the family house  in order for sale, as they can't  afford it without John.  Fundraisers are already  being planned but if you want to  send donations or have friends  who are so motivated they would  be most welcomed,  Checks are to be made out  to:  Philadelphia Family Defense  Fund  7 South Cedar Lane  Upper Darby, Pa. 19082  Maghaberry fails to protect  republican prisoner  New Lodge man John O'Hagan has  already spent 18 months on remand - effectively a three-year sentence - after he was  arrested in April 2002 following the controversial raid on Castlereagh PSNI barracks and charged with possession of documents useful to terrorists. He has been  denied bail three times by the High Court  in Belfast and is awaiting trial in  Maghaberry prison. Legal observers say  they believe his case may not be heard until  Easter 2004 at the earliest.  Meanwhile, Maghaberry is ready to  explode as a result of the NIO's policy of  forced integration between unionists and  republicans.  The practice has already resulted in  prisoners connected to the so-called  Continuity and Real IRA groupings taking  part in a no-wash protest.  And just when it appeared things  couldn't get much worse for John O'Hagan.  prison officials at Maghaberry decided to  house him in a wing alongside several  active members of the UDA, including loyalist thugs Andre and Ihab Shoukri, and Mo  Courtney.  O'Hagan is the only republican to be  housed in the wing.  Needless to say, this has already led to  a number of confrontations between  O'Hagan and his loyalist paramilitary  neighbors - the most recent of which has  spurred allegations that prison officers are  endangering his safety.  There was an altercation between  O'Hagan and Ihab Shoukri on Friday 11  July. It began when the two men exchanged  words, which then escalated into a fistfight  in full view of prison security cameras.  Although prison officers watched the  incident intensify from a verbal exchange  into a physical confrontation, they did not  intervene for a full six minutes, prompting  O'Hagan's lawyer to lodge his concerns in  a letter to the governor of Maghaberry.   The safety of prisoners should be of  primary importance to all of those involved  in the prison administration,  said the  solicitor.  Clearly, there arc vciy serious  questions to be asked as to why this incident was incurred against my client. The  ultimate responsibility lies with the governor.   According to a document obtained by  a Belfast based newspaper, prison officers  suspected that a light between both men  was imminent but took no action before the  disagreement erupted into violence.  Shoukri, who has a former conviction  for extortion, is currently in jail alongside  his colleague Mo Courtney, charged with  offences relating to the killing of fellow  loyalist Alan McCullough.  Sinn Fein's spokesperson for prisoners, Councilor Michael Browne, has called  on the NIO for the immediate introduction  of segregation, calling it  the only sensible  policy.   The treatment of prisoners like John  O'Hagan begs the question: what do the  NIO hope to achieve by their current policy of forced integration?  he asked.   The attack on John O'Hagan took  place a fortnight ago. Now there is available evidence to show that the attack developed under the eye of the prison authorities. Is it really the NIO's intention to  increase instability and endanger the safety  of individuals within the prison? On the  basis of this evidence, that's the only conclusion possible.   ,.  .

        <pagetext>The Irish People  August 9 - August 15, 2003  The Irish People  363 SEVENTH AVENUE, SUITE 405  NEW YORK, NY 10001  OPINION  IRISH SIDE HOLD KEY TO COLLUSION  EXPOSURE  The family of Peter Kelly has declared themselves less than impressed with the  belated decision of the PSNI to re-open the investigation into the nationalist councilor's 1974 murder.  And while that's hardly surprising, it docs go to show that despite recent  reforms, nationalists still don't trust the PSNI to delve impartially into its own murky  past.  In fact, Chief Constable Hugh Orde hardly boosted confidence in his force  when lie suggested that his officers couldn't  police the past . But is that really  hecause of an understandahle lack of resources or because the force wants to let its  own sleeping dogs of war lie?  If it's the latter, then that just won't wash with nationalists.  Those victims of collusion between the state forces and the loyalist paramilitaries have a right to know who pulled the trigger and who, in the back offices of  RUC barracks across the North, pulled the file.  Any attempt to brush the stale's sordid pasl under the carpet will only result in  greater alienation from the PSNI and make the work of building an accountable  police service more difficult.  And yet, the stand-off between families whether of the hundreds of  Catholics murdered by loyalist death-squads 'run' by Special Branch, or the victims  of stale forces' killings could be resolved by resolute action from the Irish  Government.  At present, nationalist victims of collusion have to trudge a weary path through  the European courts in their search for justice. For a few, there might be an independent inquiry though even that development can be stymied by the British as the  Bloody Sunday Inquiry shows but for the vast majority, the prospect of exposing  the (mill is an unlikely one indeed. After all, when individuals, often of limited  means, are pitted against the British government, might not right is likely to win out.  And Unit's where the Irish Government comes in.  Of course, almost all the victims of collusion in the Six Counties are Irish citizens. And thai gives the Irish Government a unique standing in law from which to  put right this monumental abuse. In fact, it's more than that. It places an onerous  duly on the Irish Government to act; lo speak for those who have been silenced in  Britain's Dirty War.  livery time a family like the Kellys or the Finucanes or the Nelsons or hundreds  of other equally bewildered victims appear on our TV screens lo tell of their lonely  struggle lor justice, the Irish Government should hang its head in shame.  ' 'here is no reason why these brutalized Irish citizens should have to shoulder  this burden unaided. They are citizens of a sovereign country and it's way past time  the government of that country stood up for its people.  In recent months, faced with the unilateral decision of the British Government  to close down the political institutions here, the Irish Government has vowed to act  as the defender of nationalist rights.  Northern nationalists who have always believed that being abandoned by  Dublin literally goes with the territory will take that pledge with a pinch of salt.  However, if the Irish Government were to take firm action now on collusion, it  would go a long way to easing nationalist fears as wc face into another crisis in the  peace process.

Oliver Kearney  Remembered  By Gerry Coleman  Oliver Kearney was laid to rest  today, July 28, 2003, in the north of  Ireland. Rest was uncharacteristic of  the man.  His life was about inventing  and re-inventing ways to struggle  against injustice and he unerringly  followed his principles.  For Americans who value justice and human rights, he is most  associated with the MacBride  Principles campaign, which uses the  pressure of US state and local government stock holdings to influence  corporate employers doing business  in the north to apply a set of nine  fair employment standards applicable to the Six-Counties developed  by Sean MacBride and others. But  he came to it from inside the north-  cm bureaucracy and business ethos,  where he began to make public how  the establishment worked to discriminate against Catholics. He  founded the Fair Employment Trust,  which pretty much were himself  and an old typewriter in the kitchen  of his Antrim home. He wouldn't  say he was a one man show, but he  was.  And he was a dangerous man.  He wrote the truth and he knew the  truth. A successful, career executive  in the N.I. Vintners' Association, he  began to expose the whole evil system of discrimination in the north  and how it worked. He was causing  damage. Oliver came under great  pressure from above to stop. As a  dedicated family man and father of  live, some of that pressure must  have come was from himself.  At this time, he was sought out  to lobby for a MacBride Principle  bill that was facing a legislative  fight in the States. Here he was, a  successful Catholic business executive, an exception to the rule, putting it on the line for the principle of  it.  He did almost everything for  the principle of it.  After that brief trip to America,  he was fired and became essentially  un-hirablc. When he had to tell his  wife, Brigid, I know it broke his  heart.  It didn't break her heart, nor  the Kearney family's love and  resolve. They would make do and  Oliver Kearney pretty much  became a full time warrior for  Equality.  He came into the MacBride  fight when it was hardest, after the  early, dcmographically friendly  Irish Catholic eastern states had  passed legislation. Nevertheless, the  campaign slugged its way through  the states with Oliver's help.  And it wasn't only MacBride,  at the same time he took on the US  sponsored  International  Fund  for  Ireland, which was disgracefully  entangled in the same discriminatory bureaucracy. Most of the  research that exposed its overt lack  of justice for those that needed it the  most came from Oliver. Queens  University, which was receiving US  funds, was pilloried by Oliver for  the anti-Catholic makeup of its faculty in an institution that was over  50  Catholic. Most departments  had no Catholic professors although  Catholics were well represented in  the cleaning staff.  When MacBride had run it's  course, Oliver hadn't. He delineated  a way to go through the same states  again with new, more punitive  MacBride legislation. They were  called  contact compliance bills   and they were killers. A corporate  employer in the north of Ireland not  adhering to the MacBride Principles  for Fair Employment was, by  statute, barred from doing business  with or otherwise penalized by  states and municipalities with a   contract compliance bill.  It was  comply with MacBride or no contract. Millions, even billions, were  now at stake.  So it was back to New York  State, New York City, Boston,  Massachusetts, Connecticut, New  Jersey, etc. with new legislative initiatives, another round of bringing  out Britain's dirty laundry of anti-  Catholic discrimination. The Brits  went mad. They even staffed a special office in Washington, D.C. just  to fight MacBride. But even contract compliance would run it's  course.  Not Oliver.  With his great friend, Fr. Des  Wilson, he founded  Equality ,  which focused primarily in organizing awareness and action among the  discriminated in the north of  Ireland. Northern Bank was made to  reel from Equality's wrath, as this  discriminatory  institution's Bank  Notes were deemed not acceptable  and handed back like dead mice at  monetary exchanges and banks by  the thousands to be replaced by   acceptable currency ; it caused a  wonderful ruckus.  Oliver seemed to ignore the  fact that he had inoperable throat  cancer for well over ten years during his personal fight for justice for  other people. Perhaps he willed it  away. I think he scared it into remission.  There were other schemes to  fight the apartheid system he so  hated, but his grandchildren would  occupy his last years. When his  beloved wife Brigid passed away  two years ago, you knew that  Oliver's heart was with her. Still, I  don't think he went easy.  Mostly what I remember is the  way Oliver fought to win, but never  for the sake of winning. So many  times in battling the International  Fund for Ireland or for MacBride  bills, it seemed that compromising a  bit here, a bit there, would get our  victory. Most of us mortals wanted  to get that bill signed after sometimes years of hard lobbying. Never  did he budge on these points. He  could be fierce on this. There are  NINE MacBride principles, not  eight or different ones for different  bills. He knew that to rewrite one  was to start the unraveling of the  whole. It was the principle of the  thing and it mattered to Oliver how  you fought, why you fought, and  that you know what you were fighting. To fight alongside Oliver was a  core, intense experience.  He could wither an ambassador with a phrase or make an ordinary person feci like a million, turn  around a hostile crowd with his  words and smile or chastise an audience so cleverly that even the barbs  felt good.  He was the most principled,  loving and fierce man I ever knew.

        <pagetext>August 9 - August 15, 2003  The Irish People  Pace S   My Dear,  We're Not a Democracy   By Linda Coleman  Years ago, while channel-surfing the  morning show line up in a vain search for  real news, I ran across an interesting segment in which one of the bubbly blonde  anchor women was interviewing a condescending British lord.  She had lots of questions about the  popularity of the British queen, or lack  thereof. She asked whether or not the  British public liked the queen and asked if  they would prefer she step down in favor of  her son. The stuffy lord deflected most of  the news anchor's questions, educating her -  along with the oh so ignorant U.S. television public - on the line of succession, the  importance of monarchy, and the unlikelihood of Herself getting off the throne anytime soon.  Our plucky blonde anchor kept after  His Lordship, with questions about the  growing popularity of William. Can't they  just pass over Charles, our anchor asked,  since his son is so much more popular?  The lord's eyes went cold and steely,  and the little he had of an upper lip vanished  entirely.   My dear,  he seethed,  We're not a  democracy. We're a monarchy.   See, this is the problem with England  trying to bring democracy to the Six - they  don't know how it's done.  Constitutional   though   it   may   be,  England is still a monarchy in its heart and  soul. England is good at invasion, division  and conquering. They're really good at  building  peace walls  but don't seem to  know much about building bridges. They  haven't gotten the hang of the voting thing  just yet, especially where their occupied  somebody from another planet (or this one)  trying to understand Blair's problem...   Okay, there's this guerilla army, called  the Irish Republican Army, and they've  been on ceasefire since the late twentieth  century. Over the years, they've issued a  series of press releases to the British prime  Constitutional though it may be, England is still a monarchy  in its heart and soul. England is good at invasion, division and  conquering. They're really good at building  peace walls  but  don't seem to know much about building bridges. They haven't  gotten the hang of the voting thing just yet, especially where  their occupied lands are concerned.  lands are concerned. Blair seems to think  that if his favorite candidate isn't likely to  win, he can call off the election.   My dear,  I'd like to say to him,   That's not democracy.   Oddly enough, the mainstream press  missed out on a juicy bit of irony involving  Blair and the democratic process; on May  29, the very day Blair was in Basra congratulating British troops on liberating Iraq  from dictatorship, Irish people from both  sides of the border were protesting in the  streets on what should have been their election day. These days, the media is quick to  criticize Blair's role in Iraq, but is strangely  silent on his stranglehold on Occupied  Ireland, and his absurd claim that the IRA  statement lacks clarity.  Imagine explaining the clarity issue to  minister - that's Tony Blair - reminding him  that there's not a bombing campaign going  on anymore (just in case he didn't notice)  and that they support the peace agreement.  Well, Blair says he needs more clarity. He's  cancelled all elections until he can figure  out what the IRA means when it says thing  like, 'The IRA is committed to supporting  every effort to make conflict a thing of the  past ...'   Ian Paisley and his brethren spent their  vainglorious 12th thinking up even more  pre-conditions to the electoral process, the  latest of which is that the DUP won't join  the Assembly until Sinn Fein disbands   Okay, no one's going to take him seriously,  but lan's latest rant is an astounding  glimpse into the brain of someone who has  never known democracy.   Imagine a U.S.  politician saying,  I won't go back to the  Senate until the Democratic Party disbands.  While some U.S. Republicans  might like the idea of Democrats suddenly  evaporating, we're used to the conflict and  compromise of democratic process and  wouldn't really enjoy living in a one-party  regime where opposition was met with the  tantrum,  No, No, Never, No Surrender    The UUP certainly doesn't understand  the electoral process. Apparently, Trimble's  opposition is going to keep having election  after election until they win, like so many  gamblers compulsively rolling dice in pursuit of the elusive seven.  Elections don't work like a craps game.  Sometimes, your side doesn't win. But  that's okay, there will be another election  after a pre-detcrniined amount of time and  you vote again.  At this writing, it looks like Tony  Blair's about ready lo set an election date.  Maybe you'd like to send him an encouraging note, and explain how the whole thing  works. You know his address - 10 Downing  Street, London, England.  Tell him there are no pre-conditions on  democracy. Democracy belongs to the people and is not something that is offered from  on high as a reward for good behavior, only  to be abruptly taken away if the overseer  deems the people undeserving.  Tell him to sol a date, stick to it, and not  waste this historic opportunity for peace in  the Six. Tell him to drop the lame excuse  about clarity and let the people vote   Man charged with  feud killing  Twenty-three-year-old Stephen  Dowie appeared at Belfast Court on  Saturday 16 July charged with the  murder of Jonathan Stewart in  December 2002 during the loyalist  feud.  Dowie, whose address was given  as c/o Magilligan Prison, was charged  with murdering 22-year-old Stewart at  a house in Manor Street in North  Belfast, two days after Christmas last  year.  Stewart, a nephew of a well  known loyalist, was shot six times by  a masked gunman who forced his way  into the kitchen of the house and singled him out.  Armed members of the PSNI  stood guard in the courthouse during  Dowie appearance.  Dowie was remanded in custody  until 22 August.  He was one of dozens of people  who fled the Six Counties in February,  along with Gina Adair and John  White, after the UDA declared war on  friends and associates of ousted  Shankill UDA boss Johnny Adair.  McNicholl Family  continued from page 3  ed some of the same people who harassed  my grandparents. They were given clearance  in the INS courtroom. They acted like  tourists and took pictures of each other and  with the INS was later spotted wearing an  RUC pin, obviously a memento of their visit  and an affront to the Irish community in  Philadelphia, many whom had to leave  Ireland because of harassment and threats  from the RUC.  My father lived in Northern Ireland during a time of horrendous strife and trouble.  So much has changed since then. Most people who survived this period are going on  with their daily lives, just like my parents  were doing, raising me and my brother and  sister in the only place wc know as home,  the United States. At my father's trial in  Philadelphia, the British Government didn't  request that my father should be extradited  back to Northern Ireland. The organization  that the RUC claims our dad belonged to is  not listed on the Justice's dept's list of terrorist's groups. Why then, and for whose  benefit was it necessary for the Unnoted  States Justice Dept. to come to our home and  break up our family. We demand that our  father be returned to us, he is no terrorist. He  loves the United States. We love our country.  We question now, does our government really care about us and our well being. If  George Bush really cares about us and the  sensitivities of a large Irish American community, he shouldn't be taking sides in this  Irish conflict by throwing an innocent and  law abiding and loving father out of the  country.  WE DEMAND THAT OUR FATHER  BE RETURNED. WE LOVE HIM, WE  MISS HIM AND WE WANT HIM BACK.

        <pagetext>Pace 6  The Irish People  August 9 -August 15, 2003  idealism  lives on  By Fr. Des  Many tributes have been paid  and will be paid to Oliver Kearney,  one of the most constant and brilliant  of our people who struggled for our  human rights and dignity.  Al much the same time as we  lost Oliver for the time being,  because wc tire always at one with  each other, whatever happens we  learned of the departure Of Gary  MacEoin also.  The two men were different in  some important ways. Gary worked  in America, Oliver in Ireland. Gary  lived to be over ninety years of age  and Oliver was first diagnosed with  serious illness when he was in his  early fifties.  Much of Gary's work was done  by writing: books, plays, articles, and  in lecturing. Oliver's work was often  done by lecturing and writing but he  would probably have called it  briefing  rather than lecturing toiling  people who wanted to know, or who  should know, what was really happening behind the closed doors of  factories, offices and government  buildings where, sheltered by a  veneer of respectability, the most  appalling cruelty occurred, whether  by bullying or by discrimination and  unfair employment practices.  Gary told again and  again the  stories of people who had few others  to tell their stories for them, people  living in the Americas and other parts  of the world who were often treated  like slaves, calling out to those who  had religious beliefs, or even the  slightest of moral beliefs, to come  and help them.  Between the two of them it  became more and more difficult to  cat some of the bread baked in South  Belfast or drink the whiskey distilled  in north Antrim or to admire the over  flying aircraft built in Shorts or drink  Coke without a surge of anger and a  hardening of one's determination to  end unfairness and cruelty in work  forever.  When he was over ninety Gary  showed no signs of giving up the  struggle. When he might well have  been only halfway through his term  of life Oliver was given notice that he  did not have much longer to live.  Both these men were dear  friends to us all, whether we knew  them personally or not.  They were never done studying,  Oliver brought together a mass of  facts, figures, assessments which  proved invaluable for everyone who,  dashing after him to keep up, went to  light for the MacBride Principles and  for decent equality.  Then, as if that were not enough,  continued on page 7  The  Elusive  Spondulix  Tom Culhane  954-A Stuyvesant Ave.  Union, NJ 07083  908-964-2772  Dpttv church  Loyalists up  the ante  The relative calm experienced by nationalist  communities during the loyalist Twelfth marching period came to a shuddering end over the lust  seven days as loyalist gangs attacked Catholic  homes in the Stiles estate in Antrim, threatened a  teenage Catholic girl in Dunmurry by putting a  gun to her head and torched a Catholic church  outside Magherafelt in County Deny-.  In the midst of this loyalist violence, homes  in the Clandeboye area of the Short Strand, which  had been experiencing a period of peace since the  pogroms of last summer, came under fire from  loyalist youths using ball bearings and golf balls.  Not content with their attacks on Catholics,  loyalist paramilitaries have shown the racist side  to their makeup by erecting Nazi insignia in  Ballymcna and distributing White National Party  literature as part of their campaign against non-  whites.  badly damaged  An historic South Derry Catholic church  has been badly damaged in a sectarian arson  attack. Extensive damage was caused to the  altar of St John's Church, on the main  Magherafelt to Castledawson Road at  around 5.30am on Saturday 26 July.  A window at the rear of the church was  broken and flammable liquid was poured in.  The floor at the rear of the building, which  dates from the time of the penal laws in  Ireland, was also badly damaged.  Parish church curate Father David  Moore said it would take a lot of money to  repair the damage.  The church is located yards from  O'Donovan Rossa's GAA ground, which has  been the target of sectarian attacks by loyalists on numerous occasions in recent years.  Gun put  to girl's head  A 17-year-old girl had a gun put to her head  and her two male companions, aged 14 and 26,  needed hospital treatment after they attacked by  up to 15 members of the UDA in Dunmurry on  the outskirts of Belfast at around 5.30pm on  Sunday 27 July.  The three were set upon in the car park of a  vacant supermarket in the Quecnsway area of  Dunmurry and ordered to lie on the ground by  the gang, who were wearing balaclavas and were  armed with a handgun, baseball bats and golf  clubs.  As they lay on the ground the two males  were set upon while the gunman held the gun to  the girl's head as she was assaulted.  The two teenagers were treated in hospital  for cuts and bruising while the 26-year-old man  suffered a broken ankle and multiple cuts and  bruising to his head and body.  The girl's parents, who spoke with Sinn  Fein's Paul Butler, said their daughter is now terrified.  Lagan Valley Sinn Fein councilor Paul  Butler described the attack as blatantly sectarian  and said it was part of a coordinated and vicious  anti-Catholic campaign being waged on the  Catholic community by the UDA.   This was not some group of kids. These  were armed and masked UDA men. The political  representatives of the UDA are continually  appearing in the media assuring people that the  UDA is on cessation, but the reality on the  ground for Catholics in places like Dunmurry  and Lisburn is very different.   Butler added that local political representatives have a role to play in stopping these sectarian attacks but unfortunately they have failed to  play any part in ending these onslaughts so far.   Instead of confronting sectarianism in  Lisburn and Dunmurry, unionists have decided  to institutionalize it in Lisburn Council. The  exclusion of nationalists from civic positions is  only one step removed from the violent incidents  we have witnessed in recent weeks.   Butler called on nationalists to be very vigilant.  On 20 July, a 21 year-old Catholic was seriously injured after he was attacked by a gang of  20 loyalists wielding golf clubs, iron bars and  poles painted red, white and blue as he played  golf at Aberdelghy Golf club, outside Lisburn. In  November last year, West Belfast Catholic Harry  McCartin was viciously beaten and nailed to a  fence by loyalists in the Seymour Hill estate in  Dunmurry.

        <pagetext>The Irish People  Senior UUP member in  electoral corruption probe  BY LAURA FRIEL  The Chief Executive of the Ulster  Unionist Party has been arrested and  questioned by the PSNI in connection  with serious offences within the north's  Electoral Office. Alastair Patterson (57) is  one of three former Electoral Office  employees being questioned in relation to  allegations of forgery, false accounting  and corruption.  All three were arrested last Monday  21 July and taken into PSNI custody in  Omagh, where they were questioned by  detectives.  The alleged offences took place within the Electoral Office between 1996 and  2001 and the investigation centers on  activities in the west. Both former  employees have been released on bail  pending further enquiries.  Alastair Patterson, who took up his  post as Chief Executive of the UUP last  year, first came to prominence in 1981  when he appeared on television screens  through the world as the deputy returning  officer declaring IRA Hunger striker  Bobby Sands as the new MP for  Fermanagh and South Tyrone.  As the UUP's Chief Executive,  Alastair Patterson is currently at the center of the disciplinary moves against the  three UUP MPs who resigned the party  whip. Jeffrey Donaldson, David Burnside  and Martin Smyth quit the whip at  Westminster in protest against David  Trimble's leadership of the party.  As the Chief Executive, Patterson  was due to submit the names of 20 influential party members willing to sit on a  disciplinary committee to decide the fate  of the three dissident MPs. In light of the  Electoral Office allegations, Jeffrey  Donaldson has already questioned  Patterson's role in the disciplinary hearing  within the party.  An earlier move by David Trimble to  oust the three malcontents backfired when  Belfast High Court ruled against its legal-  allegations but the unionist bias which  runs throughout the entire electoral system in the North is more insidious than  one or two unionists allegedly caught with  their fingers in the till,  said Gildernew.  Meanwhile, leading Ulster Unionist  John Taylor has threatened to scupper the  entire Good Friday Agreement if the proposed   Independent   Monitoring   Body   The nationalist electorate will of course be greatly concerned about  these allegations but the unionist bias which runs throughout the entire  electoral system in the North is more insidious than one or two unionists  allegedly caught with their fingers in the till,  said Gildernew.  ity.  The whole procedure of disciplinary  action is already seriously discredited as a  result of the High Court case and I think  that this casts further shadow over the  process,  said Donaldson.  But for nationalists, the question as to  whether Patterson is a fit person to preside  over the internal party discipline of the  UUP is of little concern compared to allegations of electoral corruption and fraud.  Few details have yet emerged. The  second former employee is reported as  being unfit to be interviewed on medical  grounds and is due to return to Omagh  PSNI barracks next month. It is thought  that the alleged offences relate to postal  voting.  Commenting on the arrest of Alastair  Patterson, Sinn Fein MP for Fennanagh  and South Tyrone, Michelle Gildernew,  said that any attempt to manipulate closely contested elections in the west could  have serious implications for the outcome.   The nationalist electorate will of  course be greatly concerned about these  includes a nominee from the Dublin government.  UUP leader David Trimble has championed the establishment of the 1MB and  nationalists have seen its establishment as  another sop by the British government to  rejectionist unionism. But as with other  concessions, as soon as they get their  cake, the unionists want to eat it as well.  With two to the Dublin government's  single nominee, the British government is  set to exercise complete control over the  actions of the 1MB. Furthermore, the 1MB  must report directly to the NIO Secretary  of State, who has ultimate power to decide  to act or ignore the 1MB.  The 1MB is a discriminatory, antidemocratic mechanism designed to place  further burdens on the nationalist electorate exercising their right to democratic  representation. But recent unionist opposition to the 1MB has nothing to do with  this; on the contrary, unionist objection is  based on opposition to even the appearance of a nationalist dimension within the  1MB.  FrDes  continued from page 6  he went back to the academic world to study  history and politics. Gary had, what was it,  nine languages?  Looking back on the life record of both  of them now one wonders whether we have  appreciated enough and been glad enough  about the intellectual brilliance and sheer  quality of men and women whom we have  been privileged to have on our side.  Great people do not ask for reward, they  ask us to listen to them, talk with them, argue  with them, think with them and together with  them work to make a new world which will  be as brilliant and as accomplished as they  are.  And our most hopeful thought is that we  have so many good minds and so many stout  hearts to present to a jaded old world that is  so sorely in need of them.  Interesting how refusal and rejection,  which are meant to destroy us utterly often,  do the opposite, they bring out the best in  people.  When Oliver Kearney was struggling for  fair employment for everybody, his job was  taken off him.  When Gary MacEoin was starting out in  adult life he asked to be allowed to join a religious order. They accepted him for a while,  and then told him, sorry, we do not want you  to stay. Both men went on to become nationally and internationally known for the unique  treasures they were.  People used to say, especially when they  got a bit fed-up with their church, that the  great thing about people with religious ideals  was not that they were always good, because  they often weren't, but that because whether  good or bad, they always managed to give  birth to saints, men and women of integrity  who, whatever happened, would pass on the  idealism to the next generation and in so  doing would save a whole people from  shame. And all our idealistic communities  are like that.  May Gary and Oliver rest in the peace  they earned and may we sec more and more  the results of their work. And happily continue it.  Human Rights Commission broken and in need of fixing  Sinn Fein Chief Negotiator  Martin McGuinness MP on  Wednesday morning led a party delegation  to meet with the Human Rights  Commission. The delegation included  Human Rights spokesperson Bairbre de  Brun and Belfast Councilor Chrissie  McAuley. Speaking after the meeting,  McGuinness said:   The establishment of the Human  Rights Commission was a key component  of the Good Friday Agreement which Sinn  Fein strongly argued for and supported. We  are, therefore, deeply dissatisfied at the  approach of the Human Rights  Commission, particularly in relation to its  approach on fair employment provisions  which could have highly damaging implications for equality as well as the Chief  Commissioner's highly inappropriate  behavior in the Holy Cross case.   Fair employment is a cornerstone of  building a new society. If you cannot even  measure what's wrong in respect of fair  employment how can you possibly hope to  tackle it? Ordinary people will not accept  having the clock turned back to the days  before monitoring of fair employment was  introduced. Nor will they accept a society  in which the rights of little children depend  on the area in which they live or the religion  of their family.   The Chief Commissioner's response  to the Holy Cross case has undermined  gravely public confidence that rights will be  promoted regardless of political background. The resignation of one quarter of  the Commission's membership is a further  cause of deep concern. A Westminster Joint  Committee on Human Rights recently identified serious problems with the  Commission.   Actions that threaten fair employment  monitoring, 50:50 recruitment as recommended by Patten or voting safeguards in  the Assembly will further undermine public  confidence.   The Chief Commissioner has failed to  provide satisfactory answers to the concerns expressed about the way the  Commission has developed under his stewardship. We have sought a meeting with  both governments to discuss these concerns  and the way ahead. We need to look at a  restructuring that will include the composition and appointments, the powers and  resources of the Commission. The Human  Rights Commission is broken. It needs to be  fixed.   We approach this issue on the basis of  wanting the best possible Human Rights  Commission in place to drive forward the  human rights aspects of the Good Friday  Agreement.   In our view, there is a need for the  British government to put in place the  measures required to guarantee the integrity, independence and effectiveness of the  Commission. We will vigorously pursue  this matter with both governments in the  time ahead.

        <pagetext>Aunust 9 - August 15. 2003  The Irish People  August 9 - August 15. 2003 Page 9  MEP harassed as case draws to a close  On Tuesday morning, following  the completion of the closing arguments of the prosecutor and the  solicitor general, Colombian  Genera  Enrique Mora, head of the  armed forces, issued a public statement vehemently calling for the  three defendants' convictions. In a  letter to the President of the EU  Parliament, Pat Cox, urging his  direct intervention with the  Colombian authorities, Fianna Fail  MEP Niall Andrews, who is attending the trial as an observer, wrote  that:  The timing of this highly prejudicial statement sends a clear and  sinister message to the court presiding over this trial that a judgment of  conviction should be rendered irrespective of the evidence.   On Sunday, Andrews w;is approached and  questioned in an intimidating manner as he left his  hotel by a man claiming to be from the police and  asked whal he was doing in the country. The man  made intimidating gestures. A short time later  another man took photographs of Niall Andrews  as he was getting into a taxi.     felt that there was some kind of psychological pressure being exerted,  said Andrews in a  statement.  I decided not to take the taxi to the  cathedral but rather to return to the hotel. As a  result I felt it was unsafe to leave the hotel alone.  I recalled similar incidents in Central America  years ago. I also feel that the whole process of  intimidation is counterproductive to the interests  of the Colombian State.   Caitriona Ruane, spokesperson for the Bring  Them Home Campaign, said:  This is unacceptable behavior from the Colombian Police and is  part of a pattern of harassment of the international  observers. I have sent a statement of this incident  to the Irish government and called on them to  make a formal complaint to the Colombian  Authorities.   In his letter to Pat Cox, Niall Andrews highlighted the high level interference in the trial.   From the moment of the men's arrest almost two  years ago, high-ranking officials in the Colombian  armed forces have repeatedly made well-publicized statements prejudging the defendants as  guilty. One such officer, General Fernandez  Tapias, made such inflammatory statements in testimony given to the United States Congress; in  support of his sentiments, General Fernandez  Tapias testified to facts and circumstances concerning the arrest and judicial process in this case  which in the course of the trial have been demonstrated to be false.  The Fianna Fail MEP pointed out  prejudicial  statements have been made by the current  President of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, and his  predecessor, Andres Pastrana, and by the current  Vice President Santos.   Vice President Santos's statement was made  a few weeks after he acknowledged to an earlier  observer delegation that it was improper for political representatives to make public statements prejudging the defendants as guilty.   There is no question that these statements by  political and military officers have been issued for  no other purpose than to  pressure the court   and to prejudice   the defendants'  right to a fair   trial. Like.  General   Fernandez  Ta p i a s ' s  statement,  these other  state  ments  are manifestly  inconsistent with the evidence  adduced at trial.   A team of international observers comprising  politicians, lawyers and human rights activists  have traveled from three continents to observe the  trial.  Also on the international delegation observing the trial are Sinn Fein TD Sean Crowe, Fianna  Fail Senator Mary White, Australian MP Paul  Lynch, Australian human rights  lawyer Shann  Kerrigan, Australian trade unionist  Brett   Gay,   US   Brehon   Law  Society     president      Steve   /  McCabc, US human rights  activist Pat  Fowler,   USJ   human   rights   lawyer   Natalie  Kabasakalian,  Irish lawyers Pat Daly  and Ronan Munro and  Irish trade unionist Des   Former political prisoners have  always played a central role in Irish  Republican politics. Today many of the  political leaders within Sinn Fein are former political prisoners, the role of prisoners and former prisoners was recognized as crucial to the development of  the peace process within the community  St local level.  An organisation called (loiste na n-  larchiml was established. Its primary  aim was to help former prisoners reintegrate into society and to enable them to  use their abilities to shape the new society that will emerge from the Irish Peace  Process.  In 1999/2000 I was granted a position within Coiste, It was a full-time paid  position. I was the director of a new sub-  unit in Dublin called Tar Isteach. My job,  indeed the project, was funded by the   fish government as pail of the peace  process. Similar projects were and are  funded by the British government in the  north of Ireland.  Many of the discussions thai we had  liming llie course of our work in Coiste  identified the need for social justice and  how thai could be achieved. We recognized the need lo study other situations  and see how conflict resolution processes were developing. To do that wc knew  that it was necessary to meet face to face  with others in different countries who  were engaged in broadly similar processes.  Declaration of Jim Monaghan  Witnesses have already explained  in detail the problems facing former prisoners including travel restrictions. With  these problems come dangers. Because  of these and previous experiences in  travel shared by each of us we felt it  wiser and safer to travel by legitimate  means but using a different identity.  I came to know Martin McCauley  through the ex-prisoner community, our  friendship developed when Martin and  his family were forced to move near  Dublin following threats to their lives. I  have known Niall Connolly for a number  of years. He is a native of Dublin and  returns there on his regular trips home  from Latin America. 1 knew Niall  worked on humanitarian projects in that  region. The three of us share the same  broad political interests. Niall and I traveled to Nicaragua together a few years  ago.  In the summer of 2001 the three of  us traveled to Colombia principally to  see the peace process but also to enjoy a  holiday. For reasons already stated the  three of us traveled with different names.  We traveled openly and the way all other  travelers would. Wc visited the peace  /one.  We spent several weeks in the zone.  We talked to a great many people. We  shared  experiences   about  the  peace  processes in Ireland and Colombia.  We discussed the involvement of  outsiders in such processes. From an  Irish perspective the advice and experiences of people involved in South  Africa, Palestine, East Timor and other  regions in Latin America were very  important.  We discussed the process of becoming involved in a political system seen as  hostile and the gains and the problems  that resulted from such a course of  action. We talked at length about the role  of former prisoners in political developments in Ireland and the Irish peace  process.  We met with members of the  FARC. We learnt from them about the  great number of visitors and political  representatives who had visited the zone.  This included members of the  Colombian government and many people from outside Colombia.  Since wc were arrested at El  Dorado airport there has been a constant  flow of misinformation and false allegations against us. The Embassies of the  United States and Britain have both  intervened to distort the truth. We were  then driven to a military barracks where  North American officials were present.  After this we were brought to the  Prosecutor's office. Everything was hap  pening very fast, there were a lot of soldiers about. We denied meeting the  FARC initially because we thought it  would make matters worse for us.  The US forensics has been exposed  as bogus. The stories of satellite pictures, videotapes and so on have been  proven to be false. The British Embassy  alleged that I am a member of the IRA. It  is illegal in Ireland, North and South, and  in England to belong to the IRA. I have  lived openly, and traveled to all parts of  Ireland over the past 17 years. I have not  been arrested or charged in relation to  any of these allegations, I reject them. I  am not a member of the IRA.  False evidence has been presented  to this court. This is clear in the case of  the US Embassy. The British Embassy  also presented as factual evidence what  amounts to no more than wild claims.  Witnesses produced by the Colombian  military have been proven to have given  false testimony.  The charge of training the FARC is  a false charge, based on false evidence.  The training never happened, and my  friends and I are therefore not guilty.  I would like to conclude by thanking my family and friends who have supported me in every way since my arrest.  The work carried out on our behalf by  everyone involved in the  Bring Them  Home  Campaign has given us strength  Thank you all.  Following the signing of the Good  Friday Agreement and the International  Commission headed by Chris Patten, a  former British government minister and  former British Governor of Hong Kong,  was established to make recommendations for the creation of a new police  service that would be acceptable to all  sections of the community. I gave evidence to this Commission based on my  own experiences at the hands of the  RUC. As a result of my court case and  the publicity it received I was subjected  to a campaign of vicious harassment by  the RUC and the British military. A bomb  was placed at my home. At that time I  was legally represented by Rosemary  Nelson, a human rights lawyer.  Rosemary was threatened by the RUC. In  1999 the same death squads that had  killed Pat Finucane, killed Rosemary  Nelson.  I was in genuine fear for the safety  of my family and myself. I moved from  the North of Ireland, which is under  British occupation and went to live in the  south.  Prior to moving south, I had been  involved with former political prisoners  in Lurgan, Co. Armagh. When I had settled into my new home I became rein-  volved with work for former prisoners. I  re-established contact with Jim  Monaghan who I had met previously.  Through this work I became involved in  discussions and debates on conflict and  Declaration of  Martin McCauley  conflict resolution.  I met Niall Connolly through Jim,  following a discussion on Latin America.  When the idea of the trip to Colombia  arose I agreed to travel with Jim and  Niall. I had never been to Latin America,  and I was interested in visiting this continent and seeing their peace process.  I have lived openly, north and south  for 20 years. I have been in regular  employment. Part of my employment  involved me adapting motor vehicles for  use by people with disabilities. I have  traveled openly all over Ireland. I have  not been charged with any of the offences  alleged by the RUC or the British  Embassy. I am not a member of the IRA.  I am not guilty of the charges laid out  against me in this court.  Like my two friends I was using  another name. Each of us had experience  of threats, harassment and violence in  shared and different situations. There is  nothing more than a desire to travel  unhindered in the fact that I was traveling  on another name. I have explained how  my life and those of my family have been  threatened. 1 have explained how two  human rights lawyers who have worked  on my behalf  Pat Finucane and  Rosemary Nelson    were murdered by  pro-British death squads.  I am a supporter of Irish republicanism. I have worked within my community to help give a political voice to their  views. I am not a member of Sinn Fein. I  have worked for Sinn Fein candidates in  elections. I believe in the right of the Irish  people to control their destiny free from  foreign occupation and interference.  The peace process in Ireland continues to survive but it has been undermined  and attacked by elements within the  British political and military establishment and from pro-British forces in  Ireland. Our arrest in Colombia has been  used by these and other elements to further undermine the peace process.  Elements in the Colombian military and  the political establishment have fed lies  and misinformation to the media to serve  their own interests. The Embassy of the  United States cannot escape criticism for  its role in this affair. Their so-called  forensic evidence against us is fraudulent  and misleading.  I wish to directly refute the evidence  given by Captain Pulido. At no stage did  I speak with this man. At the airport I was  not asked for my passport nor was I asked  my name at the time of my arrest.  Captain Pulido's testimony is wrong.  In conclusion, I wish to thank my  family and friends, the legal and political  observers who have traveled great distances to help us, and everyone involved  in the Bring Them Home campaign.  Bonass.  On Tuesday morning, the international delegation of observers visited the three men in La  Modela jail in Bogota: :. The delegation had a  meeting with the Director and Deputy director of  the jail and raised concerns with them about the  men's security.  Caitriona Ruane said it was a very useful  meeting.  We infonned thcin that we feel that  there is no safe jail in Colombia for these three  men given the high profile nature of this case,  she  said.     We   also  expressed concern     about  their seen-  rity on route to the court.   The observers were  infonned at  the meeting that a few hours prior to their visit,  three pistols, three grenades, 162 rounds of ammunition and ten mobile phones were found.   Niall Connolly rang me at 6.30pm and  infonned me that an inmate had been stabbed this  afternoon on one of the wings,  said Ruane.  It was during their visit that the TV news  reported General Mora made his prejudicial comments, calling for the conviction of the three  accused.  This is absolutely disgraceful. Where is  the presumption of innocence of these three men?   asked Ruane.  It is impossible for them to get a  fair trial. The reason he is making these comments  is to pressurize the judge.   She said the delegation was requesting an  urgent meeting with Colombian President Uribe.  Andrews pledged as a member of the  European Parliament to bring the events of the  trial to the attention of the European Parliament.  In addition, he said he would be bringing up the  matter by way of resolution to the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the European Parliament at the earliest opportunity. He said he would be raising the  issue with the Italian presidency.  In view of the  fact that Ireland will hold the presidency beginning 1 January 2004, we will collectively as a  group be seeking a meeting with the Irish  Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Cowen,  he  said.  Closing defense arguments will mark the end  of the trial this week, but it is expected to be some  weeks before a verdict is delivered.

I  was  motivated by  my  Declaration  ofNiall  Connolly  English to good use. I worked as a  translator.  On occasion,  as the  court has heard in evidence, I was  employed as a guide for visiting  politicians and media.  I became active in political  mobilization against the British  political and military occupation  of part of Ireland in the 1980s. In  particular, I was influenced by the  hunger strike in  1981 when ten  Irish prisoners died in a British  prison.   I  participated  in  campaigns and protests during this  period.   I support Sinn Fein and  wherever  I   was,   at   home   or  abroad, I made myself available  to promote the aims of Sinn F6in.  I am a supporter of the Irish peace  process and the efforts of leaders  like  Gerry Adams and Martin  McGuinness who arc striving to  bring about a lasting peace with  social justice.  I  visited  Ireland  regularly.  During one of my visits home I  got to know Jim Monaghan. Jim  was aware of my work in Latin  America and was eager to hear  my experiences.

        <pagetext>Paee 10  The Irish People  August 9 -August 15, 2003  Protecting human rights or the state?  In the first of a two-part series on the embattled Six-County Human  Rights Commission, UNA GILLESPIE explains why nationalists are  unimpressed by the Commission's performance to date and outlines the  changes necessary to secure the implementation of a satisfactory human  rights agenda.  What confidence can nationalists have  left in the Human Rights Commission  given the revelations of the last few  months? This month, wc have seen the resignation of a fourth Commissioner, Patrick  Yu, and the publication of a damning report  by the British Joint Parliamentary  Committee on Human Rights and the revelation of the breaches of the Commission's  independence by the then RUC and the role  of the Chief Commissioner in that debacle.  These events came after the previous  resignations in September 2002 of two  respected Commissioners, Inez  McConnack and Professor Christine Bell,  and the resignation the previous year of  Angela I legarty.  They also came following controversy  over the attitude of Chief Commissioner  Bricc Dickson towards the parents and children of the Holy Cross primary school.  Professor Dickson visited the Ardoyne road  on a morning when the abusive protest was  ncaring its suspension, met with the protestors from Glenbryn, defended their right to  protest and ignored the besieged children  and their parents. His attitude then lias illuminated  his behavior regarding the Holy  Cross protest since.  The latest revelations come after the  NIO rejected the majority of the 25 recommendations from the February 2001  Review of the Commission's powers. The  major issue that review and a subsequent  independent review undertaken by Peter  Hosking from the United Nations emphasized was that the Commission was restricted by the lack of power  a  to compel witnesses and documents  b  to take cases in it  own name and  c  to have unimpeded  access to certain institutions.  A long list of issues and events has  added urgency to the need to review the  entire role and remit if the Commission and  to ensure speedy interventions to rebuild  damaged confidence and ensure the vigorous defense and protection of human rights  of all people.  Nationalists viewed the Human Rights  Commission established under section 68  of the Nl Act 1998 as a fundamental element of the Good Friday Agreement. The  report from the British government's Joint  Committee on Human Rights, however, has  brought into focus and into the public arena  the fissures that have been appearing in the  Inez McCormack  Human Rights Commission for a long time.  The report examined the work of the  Commission under a number of headings:  - Independence and impartiality  - The appointments process  - Funding and resources  - Powers and functions  - Effectiveness.  The report by and  large reflects the  concerns of a number of organizations that  gave evidence to the committee during its  deliberations. Must damning was probably  the evidence given by Christine Bell and  Inez Me Cormack. The list of issues that  they outlined is as follows:  - The government's lack of commitment to ensuring that the Commission lives  up to the vision set out in the Agreement of  a Commission:  It has been our experience  that paper commitments to human rights  which are not implemented, also stand to  undermine both the Agreement and human  rights protection generally.   - The failure of the Commission to  establish a clear focus and strategic direction.  - The Commission was routinely  ignored by government departments and  other public bodies.  - The lack of powers for the  Commission for many of its core functions  and a lack of investigative powers.  - The entire process of the consultation  on and formulation of a draft Bill of Rights  for the North as outlined in the Good  Friday Agreement. The Commission from  the outset was deeply divided over the  approach to be taken to a Bill of Rights and  there was a lack of coordination over this  project internally.  - The fact that core funding is provided  by the NIO and additional finance has to be  continued on page 12  O'Dwyer   Bernstein, LLP  Brian O'Dwyer  Gary Silvennan  Christopher Downcs  Victor Greco  Cody McCone  Thomas J.

In the past, Congress had resisted funding the RUC  and PSNI due to human rights concerns, but the amendment, which was introduced by New York Congressman  Joe Crowley this past week, was not debated and was  passed without controversy.  The Bill will allow USAID to provide  computer-  based, human rights and other professional training  to the  PSNI and the Gardai  for the purposes of fostering greater  co-operation and communication  between the two forces.  Sinn Fein spokesperson on policing, Gerry Kelly,  expressing his disappointment at the decision, said acceptable policing is still a work in progress.   While this is a well meaning attempt to advance the  goal of an acceptable policing service, the reality on the  ground is that the benchmark has not yet been achieved,  because the British government choose to dilute the Patten  proposals,  says Kelly.  In 1999, the US halted the funding of FBI training for  RUC officers in the wake of controversy surrounding the  killings of lawyers Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson.  The ban was lifted in 2002 but it was announced that any  officers going to train in the US would be vetted to ensure  they had no link to the Finucane case.

        <pagetext>August 9 - August 15, 2003  The Irish People  Page 11  Movie Review:  The Magdalene Sisters   By Linda Coleman  There's a recurring pattern in human history. First, the strong oppress the weak and do  vile things to them behind locked doors, in the  name of God, patriotism or a combination of  the two. Next, the stories get out somehow,  cither because the  weak  turn out to be  stronger than expected and live to tell their  own stories, or the stories are found after the  fact in journals left behind.  Instead of apologizing and admitting  wrongdoing, the former oppressors start a  major damage control campaign, denying  everything and denouncing the stories as outrageous accusations. Finally, a filmmaker comes  along, decides to bring the story to the film-  going public, and takes heaps of abuse for  telling it like it was.  Writer/director Peter Mullan first heard  the story of the Magdalene Asylums when he  was channel surfing and ran across the documentary  Sex in a Cold Climate.  At the Q A  following the press screening in Dallas, Mullan  admitted  crying like a baby  over the story,  then becoming angry - especially when it was  reported that the Vatican received 8,000 phone  calls following the airing of the documentary,  reporting similar cases of abuse at the hand of  the church; the official report from the Vatican  dismissed the complaints, explaining that the  documentary had caused a bad case of  mass  hallucination.   Mullan, a self-described  political animal.  was determined to bring the story of the  Magdalenes to a wider audience, and made his  own film, which opened in 2002 at the Venice  Film Festival to a hostile reception from the  Catholic church. Priests attempted to intimidate audience members into staying awa  b gt;  filming those who went into the theater, hut the  controversy had the opposite effect and propelled his small, low-budgel film into Italy's  top five slot for eleven weeks   The story of the Magdalene Asylums is  perhaps the darkest chapter of Free State history, a cautionary tale on the importance of separation of church and state. The church, given  free reign to exert control over Irish society,  enacted what amounted to internment, imprisoning  wayward  women in workhouses disguised as kind Catholic charitable institutions  helping women cleanse their souls while doing  laundry for hotels, restaurants and wealthy  parishioners.  Peter Mullan's script is based on interviews with Magdalene survivors, and he uses  four central characters to tell the story. There's  Crispina (Eileen Walsh) who has a baby out of  wedlock and watches him grow into boyhood  from a distance, peering at him across the yard  when her sister brings him to the locked gate  while the girls arc hanging out laundry.   Rose  (Dorothy Duffy) also has a baby out o ' wedlock and is forced by her parents into giving  the child up for adoption. Margaret (Anne-  Marie Duff) is taken away to the Magdalene  asylum by her parents, after being raped by her  cousin, and Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noonc) is  taken away from her family in the night, a tier  being caught flirting with boys thought the  fence at her school.  All of the actresses give heartbreaking,  realistic performances; as a director, Mullan  lets Ins actors  o ' ' the leash  to connect with  the material and create their own unique performances with very little input on his part.  They all excel in their roles and will make you  weep for them, as you would for your own sister, daughter, or mother. Geraldine MeF.wan  gives a steely-eyed Shakespearean performance as Sister Bridget, the nun in charge of the  laundry; she resists what surely must have been  a temptation to imbue her role with a Cruella  de Vil characterization, and goes for a realistic,  chilling, understated cruelty.  The film has its share of dark Irish humor,  and a satisfying ending with the survivors coming out stronger than ever. Parts of the film  may be difficult for some viewers, though,  especially a scene that contains full frontal  nudity. But at the Q A in Dallas, Mullan said  that the one thing he heard over and over from  Magdalene survivors is that the nuns made the  girls stand naked in front of them and made  demeaning comments about their bodies. In  Scotland, Mullan was asked by audience members if he could have filmed it differently, with  only a head and shoulder shot of the girls;  Mullan was adamant, saying,  To not show it  clinically would be titiilation...for the political  animal in me, the girls had to get the recogni-  lion they deserve and an apology from the  church who let them down.   There's another recurring theme in human  history, the strong forcing the weak to suffer  the degradation of nakedness. The British  forced the heroes of 1916 to stand naked in the  freezing cold, allowed the H-block POWs to  go naked rather than give them their own  clothes to wear, and they used forced strip  searches to degrade and intimidate republican  female prisoners in Armagh jail; the Nazis  dehumanized the Jews in the same way before  murdering them in the gas chambers of  Auschwitz. To be coy with the camera would  do an injustice to those who suffered, so filmmakers and actors, like Peter Mullan and his  brave company of players, commit themselves  to showing the cruelty full out, hoping that  their effort will shock humanity into being  kind to one another.  Reviewed at advanced screening in  Dallas, .Inly 9, with Peter Mullan in attendance.  Nial Connelly  continued from page 9  undermine the Colombian peace process. The  so-called forensic evidence has been proven to  be false.  Our arrests and the mass of information and  false stories that have followed have also been  used to damage and undermine the Irish peace  process. The Irish peace process is at an  advanced stage. Yet more work needs to be  done. My friends have spoken about the process  of political recognition and status, the process of  negotiations   between   the   governments   of  Ireland, Britain and America and Irish republicans.  Since our arrest the Fiscal  prosecutor ,  instead of fulfilling his duty and responsibilities  to guarantee that justice is done, has arrogantly  thrown the presumption of innocence into the  dustbin, along with the independence of his  institution.  The Fiscal has failed to guarantee that procedures are respected and that the evidence is  analyzed in a just and impartial way.  Confidential details about our case have been  given to the media to upset and damage our  opportunity to get a fair trial. Fabricated foren-  sics was allowed, while DAS tests that showed  that there were no traces of explosives or drugs  were kept out.  We have been placed in jails in Colombia  under the recommendation of the Fiscal while  our lives have been in danger, and in the opinion  of one judge, who ordered our transfer, we have  been subject to degrading and inhumane treatment. Obstacles have been placed in our way  and that of our lawyers when wc were trying to  prepare our defense. Our lawyers' lives are in  danger because of the statements made in the  media, many of them by prominent politicians.  Our lawyers from Colombia and Ireland  will show that without a shadow of a doubt thai  wc arc not guilty as charged. They will also  show that this case should never have been  brought to this court. I am not guilty of the  charges laid against me. I come here today to  remind the Fiscal of my rights, my international  rights of the Presumption of Innocence.  The determination of our families and the  Bring Them Home Campaign led by Caitriona  Ruane, ihe presence of international observers  from Australia, the United Slates, Ireland and the  presence of the Irish government observers at  this trial, the messages from all around the world  of support and the active support of thousands of  people in Ireland has given us much moral support and 1 thank you from the bottom of my  heart.  Kelly murder case reopened  Family reject new probe and demand independent review  BY AINE Ne BHRIAIN  The family of an independent nationalist councilor, Patrick Kelly, who was  assassinated 29 years ago, has said they  will not cooperate with a new PSNI  inquiry and are demanding an independent  judicial review into the killing.  Patrick Kelly, a 33-year-old father of  three, disappeared on 24 July 1974, after  locking up the Corner Bar in the village of  Trillick, Co Tyrone. Later that same night,  bloodstains, shirt buttons, and cartridge  cases were found on the roadside a mile  from the town.  Kelly's body was not found until three  weeks later, after a fisherman spotted  something on the surface of Lough Eyes  in County Fermanagh, nearly ten miles  away. Kelly had been shot several times  and  there were two  561b  agricultural  weights tied to his body.  The UDA later claimed responsibility  for the killing.  To date, no one has been arrested,  questioned or charged with the death of  the independent councilor, but nationalists  have long asserted that UDR checkpoints  were operating in the area on the night  Kelly disappeared.  Then, in 1999, a former UDR man  reportedly broke down in public and confessed to witnessing the murder. The man  is said to have wept openly in a bar before  naming six of his fellow UDR members as  participants in the killing.  This past Tuesday, 29 July, the PSNI  suddenly announced they would reopen  the investigation, but they have neglected  to reveal why.  One of those expected to be questioned is former DUP Assembly member  Oliver Gibson, who is also a former UDR  soldier. Gibson says he has  nothing to  hide  and insisted that any suggestions  that he knew something about the killing  were groundless.   I have nothing to hide and nothing to  fear,  he said.  As far as I am concerned  there is no story to do with me in all this.  I do not believe I am a suspect of any  kind. The best thing at the moment is for  me to say nothing and let the PSNI get on  with it.   In the meantime, Kelly's brother,  Omagh Sinn Fein councilor Peter Kelly,  says that the PSNI decision to reopen the  case came  totally out of the blue  and  that his family has no faith in its outcome.   Wc are not happy to cooperate with  continued on page 15

        <pagetext>Paee 12  The Irish People  August 9 - August 15, 2003  Taoiseach's Dail mandate is  to demand autumn election  Cavan patriot remembered in Killnaleck  Speaking in Killnaleck. Co  Cavan, at the unveiling of a monument to IRA Captain Edward  Boylan, who was killed in the Civil  War, Sinn Fein TD Caoimhghin  O'Caolain said the Taoiseach's clear  mandate from the Dail was to  demand of Tony Blair that the postponed Assembly elections be held  in the autumn.  The Cavan/Monaghan TD said people did  not vote for Direct Rule when they voted for the  Agreement and he called on the Taoiseach to  convene a special summit with the British  Prime Minister.  Captain Edward Boylan died, aged 21, on  25 July 1922 after being fatally wounded in the  course of an escape attempt from Cavan  Military Barracks. Members of the Boylan family participated in Sunday's well-attended commemoration. Recalling the era in which he died,  i Caolain said:  The tragedy of the Civil War in  which Edward Boylan died was brought about  primarily because the British government was  determined to impose its will and retain its grip  on Ireland. It saw dial it could do so, in the  words of Winston Churchill  with an economy  of British lives  by partitioning Ireland.   We owe to republicans like Edward  Boylan the degree of freedom we have today.  They drove the British forces from 26 Counties.  They were denounced in their day by clerics  and 'constitutional' politicians as 'gunmen and  terrorists'. Many still refuse to recognize the  reality that Irish independence had to be fought  for, not because we are a warlike people, but  because repeated efforts by peaceful means  were thwarted by British political intransigence  and coercion.   This week marks another significant  anniversary' - the 200th anniversary of Robert  Emmet's Rising in Dublin. Emmet asked thai  his epitaph not be written until Ireland takes her  place among the nations of the earth. It is too  early yet to write that epitaph.   Republicans are determined lo see  Emmet's epitaph written in our time, to see a  32-County republic taking ils proud place  among the nations.   The current impasse in the peace process  is totally unacceptable to republicans. It is totally unacceptable also to the vast majority of people on this island.   When  the people voted for the Good  Captain Ibuxmb Philip Boylon I.R.A. 1901 - 22  Friday Agreement they did not vote for Direct  Rule from Westminster. Yet that is what we  have now - Direct Rule and political drill with  the institutions so painstakingly constructed  now in suspension at the behest of anti-  Agreement unionism.   A British government that falser) boasts  that it is a champion of freedom on the international stage has twice cancelled democratic  elections in Ireland and four times suspended  the  institutions  established  under the  Good  1 riday Agreement.   In May, the entire Dail called for the postponed elections to be rescheduled for this  autumn. The autumn is rapidly approaching yet  there is no sign that the British government is  preparing lo hold elections.   I call on the taoiseach Bertie Ahern to  arrange a special summit meeting with British  Prime Minister Tony Blair to discuss not  whether, but when this autumn the elections  will be held. The Taoiseach's mandate from the  continued on page 13  Human Rights  continued from page 10  applied for to the NIO:  It in effect gives  the government direct control over what  projects should be carried forward and the  shape in which they are carried forward.   An example of the latter point was  submitted as evidence. A letter in May  2002 was sent from an employee in the  NIO to the Commission regarding applications for funding for investigations. It read:   Ministers are content, in principle, to provide the funding for the investigations into  the inquest system and controversial  deaths. However, they have a genuine concern that this work must not prejudice  future legal proceedings or cut across work  being done by others, including the international judge... Release of the   30,000 associated with these investigations is therefore  conditional upon your supplying further  particulars and agreeing with us in advance  the terms of reference for these reviews so  that we can satisfy Ministers that no such  problems could arise.   Bill of Rights undermined  Other organizations had listed the  problems with the Bill of Rights process.  Sinn Fein, in its submission, stated that the  Commission's consultation document   actually diluted specific guarantees of the  Good Friday Agreement in relation to  equality and parity of esteem. The Human  Rights Commission also promoted a more  minimal approach to the interpretation of  the Framework Convention for the protection of national minorities.   In his submission, Professor Chris  McCrudden, Chair of Human Rights at  Lincoln College, Oxford, outlined the core  problems with the Bill of Rights process,  summing up:  There is now, however, a  significant degree of consensus, that the  NIHRC's document is not the way forward.  This is not surprising. The document is the  product of a radically divided NIHRC...  Documents of the kind that the  Commission was mandated to produce  need to be visionary, technically authoritative, politically astute and comprehensive.  The Commission's document is unfortunately none of these. In large measure, the  chorus of criticism to which the document  has been subjected is justified. It is sloppy,  rushed, internally inconsistent, technically  unconvincing and lacking any coherent  vision.   He also outlined some of the other core  problems with the Bill of Rights, namely:  - Failure to consider the relationship  between the Bill of Rights proposal and  existing equality legislation  - No clarity about the potential legal  status of such a Bill  - The issue of the protection of  Minorities:  The NIHRC document, over  the dissent of some members, apparently,  has interpreted the Convention protection  of 'minorities' as encompassing protection  of communities of identity more generally  and views this protection as therefore  equally applicable to majority identity  communities.   - No attempt to define what the conflict in the North had been about: The  Commission has not attempted to define   the particular circumstances of Northern  Ireland .  - The consultation documents does not  adequately address the relationship  between equality, identity and socio-economic rights.  In order to address the problems  around the Bill of Rights, Professor Mc  Crudden makes a recommendation that was  later reflected in the recommendations  from the Joint Committee:   A fresh start is necessary. It seems  unlikely that the Commission will be able  to achieve what is necessary. The  Commission should recognize that fact...  an alternative process for progressing the  project must be devised... the bare bones of  such a process are clear: the establishment  of a forum outside the Commission, with  participation from the Northern Ireland  political parties and civil society, under an  independent chair, advised by an expert  secretariat. The results of any consensus  that emerged over time would then be presented by the NIHRC to the Secretary of  State as its advice as envisaged by the  Belfast Agreement.   Independence and representativeness  A major issue for the Joint Committee  and a number of organizations that gave  evidence was the representativeness of the  Commission and its independence. Sinn  Fein, in its submission, said:  The HRC is  unrepresentative in composition of wider  society and is therefore unbalanced in  terms of community background, gender  and religious balance. Presently the composition is skewed towards a majority of  those from a unionist background, a matter  further compounded by the recent appointment of a unionist politician.'  The issue of representation and  appointment of Commissioners has highlighted the lack of independence of the  NIO appointments procedure and compounded by the fact that a criterion for  appointment does not include the necessity  to have any human rights knowledge or  experience. An example of the lack of representativeness occurred with the resignation of Angela Hegarty from the  Commission. After a long delay, one  Catholic female commissioner was  replaced by one Protestant female,  one  unionist politician, one male Catholic and  Patrick YU from the Northern Ireland  Committee for Ethnic Minorities, who later  resigned his post.  For nationalists, the appointment of  the UUP's Chris Mc Gimpsey was a clear  signal that any vestige of independence of  the Commission had been wiped away.  Later evidence has come to light to prove  that that has been the case.  It is too early to know how the Human  Rights Commission will respond to the recommendations from the Joint Committee,  but one thing is certain. Unless drastic  action is taken to remedy the situation to  ensure that the Commission fulfils the letter and spirit of the Good Friday  Agreement then we will have to stand by  and watch another pillar of the Agreement  collapse in on itself because of political  interference, lack of championship of  human rights and the failure to honestly  address the issues of the conflict and  inequalities and human rights abuses.

The political process is being held hostage by  the now dominant anti-Agreement faction in the  Ulster Unionist Party. On Friday last, David  McNarry, a leading aide lo David Trimble, accused  Jeffrey Donaldson of 'trying to cynically side-step  democratic decisions'. This is rich indeed coming  from a UUP leadership that has thwarted the implementation of the Agreement at every turn.   The current impasse makes it more important  than ever for the Taoiseach to provide for representation in the Dfiil for citizens in the Six Counties.  This will be Sinn Fein's most immediate demand as  soon as the Dail resumes.   Sinn Fein will continue efforts at every level  to break the impasse. But we cannot wait forever  and if the unionists continue to make the Agreement  unworkable then the Irish government must sit  down and work out with the other nationalist parties  how we proceed and what demands wc make of the  British government. It was nationalist Ireland that  brought about the peace process.

        <pagetext>Page 14  The Irish People  August 9 - August 15, 2003  Sinn Fein opposes GM in Ireland  Calls for nationwide consultation  Free v?s v  BY ROISIN DE ROSA  Sinn Fein delivered a serious challenge to  both governments on Tuesday, in calling on both  to have regard to Irish interests and keep the  island free of Genetically Modified (GM) seeds  and foods.  Agriculture spokesperson Gerry McHugh  delivered a sharp call on behalf of all Irish fanners to Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh to institute  a nationwide consultation on the important issue  of GM that, he said, could irreversibly damage  Irish farming interests. He was speaking at a  press conference in Dublin chaired by the city's  EU election candidate Marylou McDonald.   Sinn Fein believes that the island of  Ireland, which exports four fifths of our agricultural produce, cannot afford to allow GM seeds  and foodstuffs into the country,  he said.   Organic fanning, which is a niche market upon  which the very survival of Irish agriculture may  well depend, will be wiped out and our image of  'green clean' food obliterated. We urgently need  nation wide all Ireland consultation.    This island cannot allow one part to opt  for GM crops or food while the other part stays  free. Cross contamination of hybrid plants and  crops will contaminate the whole island,  Gerry  McHugh pointed out.   Recently, Martin Ferris and myself went  to Brussels and talked to the EU people about  this and other agricultural issues, where  Ministers in London and Dublin are not protecting all Irish interests. In the next few weeks, we  will be meeting again with the ministers here,  with North/South bodies, to impress on them the  need to institute real consultation with fanners'  organizations, with NGOs and with consumers  across our island who maybe do not want to cat  foods of which the effects on health arc most  uncertain.    People have a right to be consulted about  what they eat , said Marylou. She pointed out  that the EU Council of Ministers had only last  week formally approved guidelines prohibiting  national and regional governments from banning the use of GM organisms.   What position arc our EU MEPs taking on  this issue? What is the Dublin government  doing? Nothing. Minister Walsh told Martin  Ferris in the Dail on 17 June that he has no plans  to institute a fonnal public consultation process.   Yet,  she went on,  there is still scope for  member states to prevent the cultivation of GM  crops in some zones. Are we going to allow  Minister Walsh to let this issue go by default?    We should not allow Ireland to be pushed  down the road to GM by the EU, still less by  ministers' slevccn attitudes to multi-million dollar corporations that seek to corner the world's  food production.   Marylou scotched claims that GM foods  will boost production and alleviate food shortages in the world.  Quite the contrary is the  case,  she said.  Yields on GM crops are lower  by some 15  than with normal varieties, and far  more costly to the farmer to grow. Per capita  food production has outstripped population  growth over the last 30 years by 15 . People  starve today because they cannot afford food,  not because it is in scarce supply.   Monsanto's terminator seeds, where farmers arc obliged to purchase a chemical spray to  turn on the reproductive capacity of the seed, or  Round-up Ready Soya, which makes the plants  resistant to all other weed killers and so obligates farmers to buy Monsanto's 'Round-up  weed killer,' these GM seeds ensure that farmers  have to buy Monsanto's chemical products. Do  our farmers want to be in hock to Monsanto's  empire? At least they could be asked first.    We must expose the myth that GM  increases agricultural productivity. The real  motivation behind the drive to force GM on the  globe is to tighten the control of multinationals  on the entire food chain from seed to sale.   Several NGOs, including Oxfam, the  Countryside Alliance and Trocaire, all represented at the conference, raised wider issues of Fair  Trade and the need to push the EU and member  states to support fair trade.  Marylou herself pointed out that GM food  issues was just one part of the wider agenda of  the 'richer' countries to allow corporations to  patent life forms, under the Trade Related  Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), and she  appealed to NGOs to join together in a call for  immediate public consultation.   I do not believe,  Gerry said,  that the  people of this island support cither GM foods or  would like to realize they arc directly responsible for the impoverishment and suffering in  developing world countries because our ministers and the EU will not support fair trade  amongst nations.   Wc need these issues to be discussed  across all of Ireland, before the Cancun World  Trade Organisation negotiations take place in  September, and ministers need to listen to what  is said.   Maskey honored  in Ardara  The Sinn Fein Cumann in Ardara,  County Donegal, last weekend held a  successful function to honour Alex  Maskey the first republican Lord Mayor  of Belfast.  Maskey, who was first elected to  Belfast City Council over 20 years ago,  spoke of his involvement in republican  struggle over the years before presenting  local Sinn Fein representative Pearse  Doherty and chairperson of the local  cumann. Padraig Mac Suibhne, with a  commemorative plaque, one of only 25 in  existence issued to mark his tenure in  office.  Pictured (L to R) Pearse Doherty,  Alex Maskey, Padraig Mac Suibhne  1803 Rising remembered in  Clonakilty  Cumann Seanchais Chloich na  Coillte (Clonakilty Historical Society)  organized a commemoration last  Wednesday evening to remember the  bicentenary Robert Emmet's ill-fated rising in Thomas Street, Dublin, on 23 July  1803. While there was no action locally  at that time, four men with known associations with the United Irishmen movement were arrested that morning in  Clonakilty.  At 8pm, approximately 30 people,  including a contingent of Croppies from  Shannonvale, gathered at the Convent of  Mercy, where stood  Scartagh Cottage   where the arrests took place. Traolach i  Donnabhain of An Cumann Seanchais  extended a Cead Mile I-'ailtc to everyone  and St. Eileen McSwecncy of the convent  read out a short history of the cottage and  the grotto, which now stands on the site.  Tim Crowley outlined that Dr William  Callanan, who resided at the cottage, was  arrested with an Ulster Presbyterian and  known agitator for Catholic  Emancipation, William Todd Jones, Fr  David Walsh, the then Parish Priest of  Barryroe (and later of Clonakilty), and a  John Gould from Ardfield.  Sinn Fein Councilor Cionnaith i  Soilleabhain is pictured reading sections  from Emmet's 1803 Proclamation of the  Republic. The proclamation called for an  independent Ireland, religious tolerance  and distribution of the wealth of the  nation. It also advocated civil and human  rights for all. including prisoners of war  and the abolition of the tithes.  Colombia Three support  Mary Madden, proprietor of the  Bridge Bar Bundoran, is pictured  handing over a check to Madeleine  Connolly, mother of Niall Connolly, at a  recent function held for the Bring Them  Home Campaign. Also pictured are Sinn  Fein Councilor Michael McMahon and his  daughter in law, Mary Connolly. The committee expressed their thanks to everybody  who donated to the campaign and to all  who turned up on the night.

        <pagetext>August 9 -August 15, 2003  The Irish People  Page 15  Irish Lesson 34  PRONUNCIATION REVIEW  The group  ch  in Irish may still be  difficult for you to pronounce. If it is next  to a broad vowel,  a, o, u , it receives the  aspirated sound of broad  c . This sound is  like that in the German word  ach .  Pronounce it by lowering the raised back  of the tongue somewhat while you pronounce a broad  c , which is like the (k) in   coat  or  lock .  Try the English word  lock  and then  aspirate the (k) sound. This is similar to  the Irish word  lach  (law*k*). Then say:  loch (lohk*), duch (dook*), croch  (krohk*), gach (gahk*), sach (saw*k*).  If the broad  ch  starts a word, it is  still pronounced (k*) and not (h) in most  cases. Try: cota (KOH-tuh), chota (K*OH-  tuh), chail (k*aw*l), chaill (k*eyel),  chuaigh (K*00-ig).  We use the symbok (k*) for the pronunciation of this sound.  If the  ch  is nest to  e, i , again lower  the tongue somewhat while you pronounce  the slender  c , which is like the (k) sound  in the English  kill . The result will be a  sound like  y  in English  you , but with a  slight (h) sound before it. Try: chill (hyil),  cheannaigh (HYAN-ee), cheim (hyay*m).  Inside or at the end of a word, the sound  can be much like an (h), as in: fiche (FI-  he), crich (kree). The last word is pronounced differently from  cri  (kree) at its  end, but our simplified pronunciation  guide does not take this into account.  Instead, you must watch for this  --ch   ending yourself.  You may have seen anglicized place  names and family names with a  gh  group  in them, such as  Lough Erne  or   O'Loughlin . This  gh  was mistakenly  adopted in the 19th century as the equivalent of the broad  ch  in Irish. The non-  Irish speaker tends to pronounce  lough   as (loh) or (lawk), although it should be  pronounced (lohk*), as if it were spelled  properly:  loch , lake.  Lochlainn  means  Scandinavia (or Denmark), and a   Lochlannach  is a Scandinavian.  VOCABULARY  Masculine Nouns  hata (HAHT-uh), hat  briste (BREESH-te), trousers  ceann (kyoun), head  madra (MAH-druh) dog  doras (DUH-ruhs) door  halla (HAHL-uh), hall  Feminine Nouns  cuid, an chuid (kwid, un k*wid), part  fearthainn, an fhearthainn (FAR-in, un  AR-in), rain  scachtain, an tseachtain (SHAHKT-  in, un TYAHK*T-in), week  Verbs  bris, ag briseadh (brish, uh BRISH-  uh), break  cas, ag casadh (kahs, uh KAHS-uh),  turn  fill, ag filleadh (fil, uh FIL-uh), return  stop, ag stopadh (stohp, uh STOHP-  uh), stop  tosaigh, ag tosu(TUH-see, uh TUH-  soo), begin  thosaiomar (huh-SEE-uh-muhr), we  began  DRILL  1.

Where did you go yesterday? 1  saw you going down the road early.  Pol (pohl): Chuala mego raibheadach  saor ag na siopaisa chathair. Isteach liom  ar an traein, ach nifhaea merud ar bith arbh  fhiudom a cheannach. Niraibh moran  daoine aim, ach oiread. I heard that clothes  were cheap at the stores in the city. In 1  went on the train, but I didn't sec anything  worth buying. There weren't many people  there cither.  Mairin: Nar chuala mego bhfuil na  praghsamia (PREYE-suh-nuh) ag dul sios  anois? Didn't I hear that the prices are  going down now?  Pol: Nior chuala mee, agus nifhaea  mcc, ach oiread. Cheannaigh melcine agus  briste, agus ansin thainig meabhaile faoi  dhcireadh (YER-uh). I didn't hear it, and I  didn't see it either. I bought a shirt and  trousers, and then I came home finally.  Mairin: Nach mor an truae, anois?  Isn't it a pity, now?  Kelley  continued from page 11  this,  said Kelly this week,  I'm dumbfounded, to be honest. The first I knew  about this was when a reporter contacted me. It's a bit of a shock. The PSNI  did not even have the courtesy to let  anyone know this was happening.    I would prefer an independent  probe headed by a person from outside  the country. As a family we have no  faith in the RUC/PSNI to find and  charge those responsible. It was not  investigated properly when it should  have been nearly thirty years ago.   The PSNI have brought in a detec  tive, Andrew Hunter, from Tyneside in  England to conduct the latest investigation, but there are concerns that the  detectives working with him could be  the same ones originally responsible  for the case.  Sinn Fein West Tyrone MP Pat  Doherty says both Patsy Kelly's family  and local people remain convinced that  members of the UDR were behind the  killing.   There have been years of cover-  up and obstruction by the RUC,  says  Doherty,  In effect, the RUC assisted  Patsy Kelly's killers to escape justice.  Many of those officers remain in place  and the PSNI are refusing to confirm  that these individuals will not be  involved in any reinvestigation. There  is a real fear that this latest move is  nothing more than a further stalling  exercise and has indeed been done  without consultation with the Kelly  family.   Peter Kelly agrees with Doherty's  assessment.   I've always thought there was collusion,  he says.  There was a great  security presence in the area at the  time and something like that could not  have happened without their knowledge.   Meanwhile, the family's solicitor,  Pat Fahy, speaking to An Phoblacht,  has also expressed his unease over the  new investigation.   We ask Andrew Hunter to supply  the names of the PSNI members who  are in the investigating team so that we  could check that they were not  involved in the original investigation  but he refused to do so.   Fahy explained that Hunter said in  a letter that the PSNI members were  worried about their details being given  out after the alleged intelligence gathering operation in the RVH in Belfast.   All wc want are the names and we  said that in a letter sent to Hunter on 16  July. So far, he has not replied,  said  Fahy.

Kearney, who died following a long illness  on Thursday 24 July, was buried after Requiem  Mass in St Malachy's Church, Edendork.  Kearney fought for many causes during his  eventful life, but he will be best remembered as a  Iriving force behind the implementation of the  fair employment MacBride Principles in the Six  Counties. He was sacked from his job at the  Licensed Vintners Federation following a television interview where he spoke promoting the  MacBride Principles.  His dedication was eventually rewarded  when he was presented with the Scan MacBride  Humanitarian Award.  As an activist, Oliver was both fearless and  tireless, and his boundless determination saw him  rise to become one of the most influential speakers of his generation.  In 1991, as General Secretary of the Equality  organisation, he took on a new light against the  Northern Bank. The Six County-based bank was  cited by Equality campaigners over its employ  ment practices, which discriminated against  Catholics.  Kearney was also a spokesperson for the  Roisin McAliskcy Justice Group, campaigning to  have the pregnant woman released from an  English jail.  Four years later he graduated from Queen's  University with a Master of Social Studies  Degree in Irish Studies.  Last October, he spoke out against the arrest  of his son Ciaran over the Stormont spy ring fiasco.  Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams expressed  his sympathy to the Kearney family on the death  of Oliver describing him as a  tireless campaigner against discrimination and inequality.   Oliver was a tireless campaigner against  discrimination and inequality, and along with his  late wife Brigid will be remembered for their  efforts across the United States to see the  MacBride Principles on fair employment adopted .   On behalf of Sinn Fein I would send my  condolences to the Kearney family at this sad  New faces step in  as dual mandate ends  BY JOANNE CORCORAN  As the new dual mandate law kicks in  throughout the 26 Counties, Sinn Fein has been  selecting an impressive bunch of new candidates  to step into existing council scats. The four Sinn  Fein TDs who hold local authority seats are  affected by the new legislation.  On Sunday, Kerry Sinn Fein selected  Toircasa Ni Fhcaraiosa, daughter of Martin  Ferris, to replace her father on Kerry County  Council. Toircasa studied in UL and received an  Honors Degree in Law last month. She said she  was very proud to have been selected and even  prouder to be a member of a party with the  courage and foresight to select a young female  candidate. She said that, at 23 years of age, she  will be one of only two women on Kerry County  Council, which sends a strong political message  to the people of Kerry.   The fact that you, the members of Sinn  Fein, who have been demonized and persecuted  so much over the last 30 years, have selected me,  a person who joined Sinn Fein at the age of 16  when it was certainly easier and more popular,  says a lot about your dedication to the cause of  Sinn Fein,  said Toireasa.  This seat never  belonged to my father and it will not belong to  me. It belongs to the people and that will never  change.   She added:  Sinn Fein can help reinstall faith  amongst my peers in the political system. This  government and the governments of the past have  failed our young people, with their cozy-cartels  and their politics of brown envelopes, corruption,  and deception.   Following this trend of young candidates,  27-year-old Tomas Sharkey has been selected as  replacement for Arthur Morgan on Louth County  Council.  Addressing  the  convention,  Arthur      Arthur Morgan congratulates Tomas  Sharkey after his selection by Louth Sinn Fein  to replace the TD on Louth County Council  Morgan said:  I am amazed that four years have  passed since I was elected to the Council, it seems  more like 19 or 20. At times I felt like I was  ploughing a lonely furrow. However I am convinced that after next year's elections my replacement will be part of a strong Sinn Fein team.   Tomas, from Kilkerley, is a secondary  school teacher of Irish and history and was active  in student politics during his time in Queen's  University and Maynooth College. He thanked  the convention for selecting him, and added:  I  hope I can be as effective a councilor as Arthur  has been. If they thought he was a difficult customer, wait 'til they meet me    Louth was busy with conventions last week,  selecting four new candidates for the South Louth  area for next year's local elections.  Mathew Coogan and Imelda Munster were  selected to stand for Drogheda Borough Council  and for Louth County Council. Dom Wilton was  selected to run for Drogheda Borough Council  while Tom Cunningham joins the Louth County  Council ticket.  The Voice of Irish Republicanism in America
