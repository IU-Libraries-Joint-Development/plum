OCTOBER 31, 1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  PAGE 2  Ford Slammed for Discrimination  Sectarian divisions run deep in  the Ford Motor Company's  West Belfast plant, according to  a 27-page report leaked last  week.  This is despite company denials  that religious discrimination exists in  Fold's Finaghy Road North plant.  The report by the American-based  Investor Responsibility Research  Center (IRRC) stated that Catholics  were underrepresentcd in some job  categories and called for affirmative  action to rectify departmental  imbalances.  The draft report makes no  conclusions. Those involved are at  pains to point out that it is not in a  position to prove or disprove  complaints or grievances.  Nevertheless,  the  latest report  differs   from   the   IRRC   January   1991  Oliver Kearney of the Equality Group  examination of employment practices at  Ford and five other American companies  with factories in  northeast Ireland. Then,  the IRRC stated that the  278 Catholics in Ford's  700 workforce   accurately reflected the  rehgiousaffiliationofthe  working-age  population.  But in the  briefing paper dated July  1992 and received by  Ford management last  month, the IRRC reports  a catalog of cases of  alleged discrimination  againstCatholicworkers.  In September 1987,  Ford published its first  fair-employment  practices and policies  report and issued its own  set of principles. But in  the  IRRC  report  it  was  stated,   The  principles are not posted and management  does not appear to have done much lately  to keep the pledges made in the principles  in the forefront, except to make available  the annual report on compliance.  IRRC  added that  tension between Protestants and  Catholics at Ford is considerable  and that  there was  a strong sense of grievance  among some Catholic workers.  It pointed  out that  workers were pursuing  discrimination complaints.   A Ford Motor company spokesman for  Britain confirmed that it had received the  IRRC draft report last month. The Ford  representative said that the company would  not comment on the content of the draft  report or the conclusions of the final  version   to be received next month   until  after they had been studied.  The campaigning northeast Ireland  group, Equality, nevertheless described tlie  report as  fairly damning  and claimed that   serious imbalances  at management and  supervisory levels remained.  SANDS FAMILY ENDORSES  PETER KING FOR CONGRESS  Peter King and Rosa leen Sands at Hunger Strike Rally in Ireland  The family of Irish hunger striker Hobby Sands has announced its support  of Peter King in his campaign for Congress. In a statement from Belfast,  the Sands family said:  l4We are proud to endorse Peter  King's candidacy for the United  States 1 louse of Representatives, and  we urge all Americans who support  human rights, justice and freedom  for the Irish people to vote for Peter  King. Peter King is not only a friend  of our family, he is also a true friend  oi the nationalist community. He has  made repeated visits to the north of  Ireland at considerable personal and  political risk. At SO many key  moments the hunger strikes, the  plastic-bullet tribunal, the supergrass  trials, internment demonstrations  Peter King was the one American  who was always there.   Peter's election to Congress  will guaranteee that the Irish issue  is raised at the highest governmental  levels.   His  election  will   send   a  message to London and Dublin, as  well as to Washington, D.C., that  British oppression of the Irish people  will be subject to public scrutiny and  debate. Just as importantly, Peter  King's election will offer hope and  encouragement to the nationalist  community.   (signed) Rosaleen and John Sands  Marcella Sands Kelly  Hernadette Sands McKevitt  Seta Sands  King said that he was  gratified and  honored to be endorsed by the Sands  family. I have never met more noble or  courageous people, and I will do all that  1 can 10 justify their friendship and  support. When 1 am elected toCongress,  1 Will use all the powers of my office to  foCMS national attention on British  oppression in the occupied six  counties.   m  jpjyEfl  - '    ;*WnjS  -                                         i?B      ij   H  4*  -                   -  L A     i   sps  .

'.         -'-              Queen's University, symbol of discrimination  Kennedy Vows to Fight  Queen's on  Jobs Bias   Congressman Joe Kennedy has said  that he intends to step up his attempts  to see Queen's University's fair-  employment record highlighted in  the United States.  He warned that he also plans to ensure  that the university is not helped by   American-taxpayer dollars or funds at  any level.  He described the university as  a  bastion of sectarianism in northeast  Ireland'* when it came to fair employment.  A statement from the Congressman's  Washington office follows an exchange  a month ago in which he called on  Queen's to tackle its fair-employment  problem. Tlie university claimed that it  was the victim of a smear campaign.  In his latest statement, Congressman  Kennedy says,  When all is said and done  and the excuses are set aside, the cold hard  fact remains that Queen's University  shamelessly continues as a bastion of  sectarianism in northeast Ireland on the  question of fair-employment practices.  Bar a university with a student body with  a nationalist majority not to reflect  comparable numbers from the community  in its hiring and promotion policies is not  only inexcusable, it adds to the division  in the whole of northeast Ireland's society.   How can Queen's justify a workforce  where only one in four of its employees  comes from the nationalist community?   He added that the university had an  obligation to  actively recruit  within the  nationalist community and to demonstrate  that it was clearly opposed to religious  discrimination.   For a university that is the training  ground for so many of northeast Ireland's  civil servants, developing an ethos that it  is opposed to religious discrimination is  vital.   He claimed that the university was  intent on  trying to preserve the status  quo  and that this had done nothing for  its reputation at home or overseas.  A university spokesman replied,   Misleading and uncorroborated  assertions about the university's policies  and practices are unhelpful in furthering  fair-employment and equal-opportunities  objectives to which this university is  committed.
