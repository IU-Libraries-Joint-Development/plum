OCTOBER 31, 1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  PAGE 14  Loyalist Threats Fail to Shut Down Sunday Newspaper  A newspaper under loyalist threat  will publish as usual this week.  Rumors within the industry had  suggested that the Sunday World could  face closure because ot Ulster  Volunteer Force threats, but these were  dismissed by a reliable source.  The staff at the newspaper had been  ordered by Dublin-based management not  to talk to other reporters about die situation  at die office. It climaxed last week in a UVF  bid to bomb the High Street premises and a  subsequent threat from die organization  against its staff and distributors. Now it is  thought that publication of die newspaper     which has run investigative stories about  both loyalist and republican  paramilitaries   will proceed as usual.  It is understood that management had  discussions with the staff shortly after one  Of the biggest demonstrations by northeast  Ireland journalists in recent years.  Representatives from almost every media  Loyalists  outiet in Belfast took part  in the demonstration  outside the newspaper's  offices at lunchtime to  highlight opposition to  the attempted  intimidation of  colleagues. Attended by  several senior union  officials, including  National Union of  Journalists' deputy  general secretary Jake  Ecclestone, it also had  the support of other  union groups and  political parties.  Before taking part in  the protest, which was  attended by more than 50  representatives of print  andbroadcastmedia, Mr.  Ecclestone said reporters  on the paper have the  M  rkino    of   journalists  .  everywhere  because we believe that  freedom of expression, of ideas and  opinions is fundamental to a civilized and  democratic society.  He said that the attempt  to  censor the press by violence   demonstrated two things about the UVF.   First, they have no arguments or ideas  except the bomb and the gun; second, that  they hold the people of northeast Ireland in  contempt.   He added,  Censorship is an expression  of fear, and journalists in northeast Ireland  have struggled over many years to conquer  this fear. They will not be defeated now.   Mr. Ecclestone told the UVF,  If you don't  like the Sunday World, organize a peaceful  boycott. You don't do it by guns and  bombs.   National executive member representing  northeast Ireland journalists, Kevin Cooper,  said that die UVF and Combined Loyalist  Military Command's statement was as  much an attack on the democratic right of  the unionist community to read the  newspaper of their choice as it was an attack  on free speech and press freedom.  Two Tyrone Men Jailed by Dublin Court for Attempted Murder  Two Tyrone men were sentenced to  twelve years at the Special ( Timinal Court  in Dublin for the  attempted murder of an  Ulster Defence  Regiment        (til)k)  soldier near the border  last February despite  the tact that the UDR  tfOOper's account was  contradicted by a  British forensic expert  and by his earlier  statements.  James Hughes and  Conor O'Neill were  convicted in the case  The      incident      had  occurred at  Scardans  Upper, Bcllcek,  Fermanagh, on  February 5th. The men  were also given  concurrent 12-vcar  sentences for having  firearms with intent to  Former British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher reviewing the  I fitter Defence Regiment  endanger life at Helleek and 10 years for  having two Kalashnikov rifles, a revolver  and ammunition in  Donegal on the same  date. The court made  DO finding on a further  charge of shooting at  the trooper witii intent  to cause grievous  bodily harm.  Mr. Hughes (28),  and Mr. O'Neill (27),  both from Dungannon,  Tyrone, but with an  address at Westport,  Ballyshannon,  Donegal, had denied  all charges.  The trial was under  die 1976 Criminal  Law Jurisdiction Act,  which allows for  suspects to be tried in  the south for offenses  allegedly committed  in northeast Ireland.  The court was told during the nine-day trial  that Mr. Glass (49), a Fermanagh dog  warden and UDR corporal, was lured into  an IRA ambush at a remote farm one and a  half miles from die border. The trooper shot  dead an IRA man, Joseph MacManus (21),  widi his personal-issue pistol and forced  others to flee. He was injured in both legs  after he was hit by seven bullets and is still  on crutches. The accused men were arrested  shortly alter the incident by gardai who  found them in a ditch close to the border in  Donegal. Two Kalashnikov rifles and a  revolver were found some time later.  Sentencing the men, Justice Barr,  presiding, said that die court was satisfied  that die probably primary objective of die  men was to hijack the trooper's van. Tlie  court was aJ so satisfied tiiat both the accused  men were part of an IRA squad. The judge  said it was likely that the plan was to hijack  the van, that the men did not know Glass  was a UDR member and armed, and that  his response in killing MacManus  came as  a complete surprise.  He said the court did  not accept Glass's account of what  happened and it was likely that he fired first.  Glass's initial account to the RUC was  unreliable.  The judge said the court had taken into  account the age of the accused men and die  fact that neither of them had previous  convictions.  They have been brought up  in northeast Ireland at a time of much strife  and inter-community tension and violence  there, which may well have had some  bearing on the formation of their  characters,  he added.  TOP GARDA WAS  BRITISH AGENT, SAYS MI6 MAN                           a  LIAM RYAN  Third Anniversary Memorial Mass  Will Be Held At  Visitation Parish  160 Van Cortland Park South  near 240th St and Broadway  Saturday, November 28th, 7:30pm  Sponsored by Irish Northern Aid  Social to follow at Jesse James Tavern  Liam Ryan's favorite pub  236 Street and Broadway, Bronx, NY  For Information call 212 736 1916  A former British intelligence agent  has claimed there were pro and anti-  IRA factions within the Garda. Fred  Holyrod, who worked as a military  intelligence officer with MI6 in  Ireland in the 1970 s.  I got the  impression from them that there was  a lot of suspicion around, that even  within the gardai there were two  factions, those who were anti-IRA  and those who were pro-IRA, ki he  said.  The late Ned Gavery's period as  Garda Commissioner was one of the most  controversial in the history of the Garai and  he was ultimately sacked by Fianna Fail in  1()77. During 1975and 1976 allegations that  suspects were being beaten in Gardastations  began to emerge and a number of gardai  have since claimed a  heavy gang  existed  within die force.  He had recruited Garvey in the  mid-70's when he was the second most  senior Garda official in Dublin, Holyrod  said. Before he was promoted by the Fine  Gael government to Garda Commissioner  in 1975. Garvey was head of C3, the  intelligence unit of the Garda.  The former MI6 agent said he had  a Garda officer operating in the border area  in the mid-70's under the codename  The  Badger , and had been in contact with other  gardai in the South.  It was clear they had  authority from high up , he said.  I was  asked by some of the gardai to go down to  Dublin and I agreed. I was taken to the  Phoenix Park and introduced Garvey.   There was another man present at  that meeting who, Holyrod said, he  understood to be a senior army officer.   They made it clear that they wanted to pass  on information to the British,  he said. After  being shown an IRA arms factory which had  been discovered in Donabate, near Dublin,  he was asked to trace the British machinery  used in that factory.  Holyrod said Garvey had supplied  him with 150 photos had files on IRSP  members which he brought back to his  controller. He had made arrangements with  Garvey to meet on a monthly basis.  But Garvey  told me to be careful  who I talked to in the forensic laboratory   and named one person whom be should not  talk to.  ////  Voice of Irish Repi hlicasism is America  v*
