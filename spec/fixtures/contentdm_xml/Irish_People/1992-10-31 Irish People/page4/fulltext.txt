OCTOBER 31,1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  PAGE 4  On November 3rd, the Choice for  Irish American Voters is Clear..,  For 12 years, the Republican Administrations of Ronald  Reagan and George Bush have demonstrated positive and  deliberate hostility toward the concerns of the Irish  American community* On November 3rd, we can allow this  tradition of neglect and outright disdain to continue, or we  can take a positive step toward change by electing the only  Presidential candidate who has shown any interest in our  concerns   BILL CLINTON.  AS PRESIDENT,  BILL CLINTON WILL...      Encourage all states to adopt the MacBride principles.      Highlight human-rights abuses in northern Ireland by focusing  on reports by Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch.      Support sending a US Peace Envoy to northern Ireland to help  break the political logjam and lead all parties concerned toward a  peaceful resolution of the conflict.     Never allow another Joe Doherty-type case to occur   Bill  Clinton will leave the judicial decisions to the judiciary. He  believes that all applicants for political asylum are entitled to a  full and fair hearing on their claims regardless of the US  government's relationship with the nations from which they flee.  The Irish American community is tired of being  ignored by Washington. We must seize this  opportunity to elect Bill Clinton, because it is  time we once again had a friend in the White  House   not an adversary.  In addition, we encourage you to  support the following candidates...  For US Senator from New York, vote for BOB ABRAMS  In the 13th Congressional District, vote for SAL ALBANESE  In the 9th Congressional District, re-elect TOM MANTON  In the 14th Congressional District,  vote for CAROLYN MALONEY  VOTE FOR CLINTON-GORE....BECAUSE  THE TIME FOR CHANGE IS NOW  ON NOVEMBER 3RD-REMEMBER JOE DOHERTY  Paid for by IRISH AMERICANS FOR CHANGE  and supported by the following individuals:  Kevin Barry Mary Brady*Kathy Iiyrne*Anne Canty Frank T.
