OCTOBER 31, 1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  IT'S NOVEMBER-TIME TO REMEMBER    George Bush in the middle of the night sent Joe Doherty back in  chains to British-occupied Northeast Ireland.  George Bush sent the American-born citizen Liam  Quinn to England to face the same legal system  that wrongfully jailed the Guildford Four, the  Winchester Three, Judith Ward and the  Birmingham Six for seventeen years.  George Bush forced American citizen Liam Ryan,  a supporter of Irish freedom, back to his  assassination by British murder squads.  George Bush's federal agents have continuously  arrested and harassed Irish activists at the behest  of the British Government, such as  Gerry McGeough  Colum Meehan  Eamon Meehan  Gabriel Megahey  Francis Gildernew  Jim Barr  Sean Mackin  Philomena Mackin  George Bush's Justice Department has  imprisoned supporters of Irish freedom, such as  The Boston Three  The Florida Four  The New York Five  After the Irish beat George Bush in open court, he went behind closed doors and  stripped away from the Irish the time-honored American tradition of protecting political exiles.  George Bush says that when it comes to political the  Irish need not apply .  George Bush refuses to allow Irish their First Amendment rights by denying Gerry Adams  and other Sinn Fein members a visa to speak to the American people.  Now George Bush wants to send Jim Smyth and Kevin Barry Artt  to join Joe Doherty in a Northeast Ireland prison.  We urge all the 44 million Irish Americans to  vote for Bill Clinton who has promised that  there will be no more Joe Doherty's.
