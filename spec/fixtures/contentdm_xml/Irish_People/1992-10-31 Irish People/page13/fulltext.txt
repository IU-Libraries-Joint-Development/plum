OCTOBER 31,1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  PAGE 13  Fury Over Mandela IRA Comments on British Television  A storm of controversy has arisen  after African National Congress  leader Nelson Mandela, in an  interview broadcast on British  television, described the Irish  Republican Army as being engaged  in a fight against colonialism by a  foreign country  So embarrassing were the  comments that the Dublin government's  Foreign Minister David Andrews has been  urged to devote his upcoming visit to South  Africa to challenging Nelson Mandela to  withdraw his comments. Tlie ANC  defended Mandela but, mindful of the  support which it receives from a wide range  of Irish, including government officials and  public celebrities opposed to tlie IRA,  issued a statement that Mr. Mandela's  statements  cannot be construed as support  for the IRA.   The controversy began when Mr.  Mandela was interviewed by rock star  turned TV talk show host Bob Geldof.  Geldof, a vocal critic of die IRA and  heretofore an ardent admirer of the ANC  leader, was visibly angered when his guest  said that  The IRA are conducting a struggle  for self-assertion. They do not want Britain,  a foreign country, to run a country.   Geldof angrily voiced his  objections to Mandela's statement, saying  that  But a majority of our people do.   Mandela, who had served 27 years in the  Nelson Mandela  maximum-security prison at Robben Island  for his leadership role in attempting to  organize a military overthrow of tlie  apartheid regime, responded that  There are  large numbers of people who do not believe  in what wc say. Nevertheless, we're  convinced that what we are saying i s correct.  Catholics now make up more than 40  percent of northeast Ireland population     even though official figures at first seem to  indicate otherwise.  When those who failed to respond to a  census question about religion are taken into  account, Catholics appear certain to make  up more than two fifths of the people living  in northeast Ireland.  Published last week, the 1991  census summary report puts the Catholic  population at 606,639, or 38.4 percent. In  1981, 414,532 stated their religion as  Catholic. The 1991 report shows in  northeast Ireland there are 336,891  Presbyterians, 279,280 people belonging to  the Church of Ireland and 59,517  Methodists. Those figures represent a fall,  by some 8,000-in the number of  Presbyterians since 1981, but slight  increases in the number of followers of the  Church of England and Methodists.  Of the 122,448 people in die 1991 report  who said they belong to other  denominations, 19484 are Baptist, 12,446  Brethren, 12,386 Protestant and 12,363 Free  Presbyterian Church of Ulster. For tlie first  time there was an opportunity for people to  say they belonged to no religion   59,234  did so.  Although totals, as expected, show no  dramatic change since the last census a  decade ago, it would now seem the number  of Catholics has edged above the 40 percent  mark.  Some politicians have traditionally  looked at that figure as a significant  benchmark in terms of predicting a shift in  the religious balance within Northern  Ireland.  Any startling change, however,  would appear highly  unlikely given a  general trend in Ireland towards a decline  in Catholic family size. Due to this factor,  and others, experts have in the past ruled  out pronounced increases and decreases in  the overall population, or in the numbers  belonging to any particular religion.  Applying a formula used to codify people  who did not state their religion in returns,  tlie Catholic population in January 1981 was  out somewhere between 38.5 and 39.2  percent.  Problems in calculating 1981 returns  were compounded by a boycott is support  of republican prisoners in the H-Blocks and  that year's hunger strike. A census taker was  shot dead in Derry.  Demographic experts who studied the  1971 figures, when there was also an anti-  census protest, estimated about 57 percent  of those who did not state their religion were  Catholics.  Applying their formula in 198 would  have put the Catholic population between  517,026and589,026.Thefigurespubiished  showed 114,827 people   7.8 percent of the  population   did not respond to the religion  question.  ExacUy how many of those are Catholic  is difficult to determine.  In 198, some 275,000 people     18.5 percent of the population   refused to  answer the question about religion. In 1971,  9.4 percent did not return the forms.  A key figure not included in the  summary concerns the birth rates of those  belonging to a particular religion. Generally  regarded as a more accurate indicator of the  long term balance it will be dealt with in a  report relating specifically to Northern  Ireland's religious composition due to be  published in 1993.  We don't want any form of  colonialism, and wherever it is, we  support those who fight it. People  I have a right to self-expression.   I When Geldof raised thequestionot  innoeenteivilians getting caught up  in the campaign, Mandela replied  that  In any conflict, some people  will be hit by crossfire. It has  happened throughout history.   The interview unleashed  a wave of criticism from public  figures, including those who in the  very recent past were only ioo  happy to jump on the bandwagon  to praise the 76-year-old leader tor  his lifelong struggle against  apartheid. Establishment  politicians attempted to limit the  influence of Mr. Mandela's  comments without appearing to  being too critical of Mr. Mandela  personally but ended up insulting  or patronizing him. Most tried to  take tlie view that Mandela is in  some way ignorant about the  situation in Ireland.  For example, Dublin mayorGay  Mitchell described Mr. Mandela,  who was granted tlie Freedom of the City  of Dublin, as  misinformed and arrogant.   He urged Dublin Foreign Minister David  Andrews to confront Mandela directly  during an upcoming visit to South Africa.  Proinsias De Rossa said that Mandela was   dangerously     misinformed,  The  condemnations echo similar reactions from  the same sources last year when in Dublin  Mandela urged dialog including the 1R An gt;  bring tlie conflict in tlie North to a peaceful  resolution.  Mandela's comments come  against a background of longstanding  revelations that the South African  intelligence services have been supplying  weapons to various loyalist paramilitary  gangs, especially the Ulster Volunteer Force  (UVF), and had contracted out to a loyalist  hit squad an assassination attempt on a  South African dissident living in England.  Mandela's comments have a  political as well as practical basis. It is well  known  that    the loyalist political and  paramilitary groups identify with tlie  apartheid South African regime as sharing  a similar  white man's burden  in struggling  to hold off the restless  native  population.  On tlie other hand, the Republican  movement has in iLs public statements, its  publications, and even in a number of  prominent wall murals throughout the  North, voiced its support for Mandela and  the antiapartheid cause.  The controversy was further fueled  by the comments of recently released ANC  member Robert McBride. His release from  a South African prison was part of an  amnesty grudgingly granted by the Pretoria  regime in an attempt to revive (lagging  negotiations with the ANC. Mc Bride,  whose great-grandfather, Major John  McBride, was executed by the British in the  aftermath of the 1916 Easter Rising,  commented at length on his involvement in  Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the military  wing of the ANC.  When questioned about the ANC  campaign, McBride said that whatever tlie  moral qualms might be about such a  strategy, 'The original sin is with apartheid.  If there were no apartheid, there would be  no Umkhonto we Sizwe. Let's go to the  source, not the byproduct. Whenever there  is conflict, you have negative spinoffs.   Mayor Mitchell, who demand that the Irish  AntiApariheul Movement should  put Mr.  Mandela right'1 and  reassure the people  here   m Ireland) that the ANC  is not an IRA-  type campaign,  will first have to explain  the difference he sees is McBride's  statement and the similar explanation given  by   IRA   Spokespersons   for   the   armed  struggle in Ireland.  The freedom fighter and great-  grandson of a freedom fighter called on the  British government to negotiate with tlie  IRA and added,  I have become almost  obsessed with Ireland and Irish history and  especially the struggle for freedom. The  determination of the Irish people to be free  from so many years of oppression is  something I look up to. It's something I  admire in the Irish people   the tenacity of  the Irish people to stand up even against the  greatest odds.  McBride has expressed a  strong desire to visit Ireland.
