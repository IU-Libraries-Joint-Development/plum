PAGE 8  THE IRISH PEOPLE  OCTOBER 31, 1992  OCTOBER 31,1992  THE IRISH PEOPLE  By Hilda McThomas   THERE'S BEEN A shooting in the York Hotel near  the University. Two women. I think one of them is  Sheena Campbell . A friend's voice on the phone,  Friday evening, shortly after eight. The words hit me  like a punch in the stomach. Sheena. No, not Sheena.  Driving to the Royal Victoria  Hospital on die Fall* Road, hoping  that she is there, injured may he, hut  close to her friends.

At   the  reception we are told  yes,        she        was  admitted, to go into a  small room.  There a  chaplain is waiting to  break   the   news   to  relatives.   Oh   (iod.

Then I saw this  small figure, a young girl, sitting at  a desk ticking off names, adding  Sheena with John O'Dowd and Brendan Curran handing  in her nomination papers to Craiagavon Civic Centre in  April 1989  figures. Blue eye-shadow, short  brown hair, high cheek bones,  Sheena looked about eighteen.  Someone else m a corner sorting  sheets from registers.

We realised she had chased  out oi the oiiwe all the usual  hangers on, probably given them  work to do.

There she attended  Lismore Comprehensive School.  She left it at 16, with no incentive to  go on, no sense then that she could  make it*. Sheena went to work in a  factory. Her mother too had left  school young, gone to work. Yet her  younger brothers, Sheena's uncles,  had continued on at school, gone to  university, kmade if out of second-  class citizenship.  The l;agans are a musical family.  Sheena loved  music, Irish  music, country  and western,  classical. She  sang a lot,  learned die piano.  A keen netball  player, she  missed selection  to the Six  Counties squad  because of her  small height. But  from the start  Sheena's life was  politics. In her  early teens she  started selling  Republican  News, went with  her mother to  meetings and  marches. At  fourteen she was  acting secretary  of her local Sinn  I(3in cumann.  She would attend  as delegate the  meetings of the  Ulster Executive,  the forerunner of  the Comhairle na  S6 Chondae. She  also did a stint as  a youth leader in the local youth  club, and was active on several  community and tenants'  associations.  She joined the Relatives' Action  Committee as soon as one was  formed in Craigavon. As the fight to  end criminalisation of Irish POWs  was intensifying, Sheena became  more active, and helped form a  youth committee, the first Youth  Against Armagh and H-Blocks,   before it was ever heard of in  Belfast,  she rightly claimed.  During the hunger strike, she was to  lead a pupils' walk-out out of her old  school, 1 ismore Comprehensive.  One oi her teachers there was  Tom French, of the Workers' Party,  with whom she had many an  argument while at school. In 1985,  aged only 23, she would stand  against him in the local elections, in  the ('raigavon Central ward. Sheena  polled tw ice as many first preference  votes as her former teacher, and  political rival. But while she failed  to get elected, Tom French  benefitted from transfers from the  Alliance Party and got a council seat.  Nevertheless, this spelled the end for  1'om Frcnch in that ward. (At the  next local elections, he shifted to the  Lockside ward where he got his seat  with die help of unionist transfers.)  Sheena had to leave work at  eighteen, because of a heart  condition. She got married then. Her  marriage ended amicably a few  years later, and she shared her life  between her son Caolan, and her  politics.  People  in   Sinn  F  in  quickly  afterwards, call me a 'brat'.    The local Sinn F6in organisation  was reorganised along constituency  lines. I got credited for this,   Brendansays,  but die credit wasn't  mine. I knew nothing about the area  The organising and restructuring  was Sheena's work.  Sheena  became chairperson of the  Comhairle Ceanntair in 1986. She  also held positions on the Comhairle  recognised her organising abilities.  While she held the position of  secretary on the Comhairle  Ceanntair, her role was in fact that  of an organiser. She was nominated  as candidate for Sinn F6in in the  Assembly elections of October  1982, but her name had to be  withdrawn   she was underage, not  yet 20   Brendan Curran, her partner,  recalls how he first met her.  There  were problems in the local Sinn F6in  organisation in 1982-'83, and I was  sent to this meeting, I was not long  out of jail, they must have hoped that  the presence of someone recently  released from the H-B locks might  stop people from bickering and  fighting. So I got cleaned up and  shaved, and arrived at this meeting  with not a clue as to what it was  about. I sat at the top table, beside  Sheena, who was secretary. Sheena  Limisteir as secretary and organiser.  She traveled a lot tlirough the Upper  Bann area, South Down, Newry-  Armagh. She was well-known and  loved everywhere. Ather funeral last  Sunday, the large crowds came from  all over the North, and quite a few  from the 26 Counties as well.  Yet in spite of her abilities Sheena  was always reluctant to take on  positions. She only agreed to speak  in public as a stand-in for a comrade  who could not make it. This is how  she came to speak at the Easter  commermoration in Cullyhanna in  1983, her first public engagement.  Jim McAllister recalls how she was  nervous at first, and then did so well  that the local people kept asking for  her to come back.  But her forte was organising.   She had a gift for details,   Brendan says,  she just seemed to  know what was needed, where the  wee cogs were missing along the  Sheena*s father and sister Gabrielle bearing her  Tricolor-draped coffin  pulled out this book and started  writing. Tut that book on the table  and let on you know what you are  doing,' I quipped. She looked at me.  She would slag me for this for years  way.  Sheena talked about  structuring meetings before anyone  else in Sinn Fein, and drew up for  her Limist6ar detailed papers  describing the jobs involved in each  of the positions. She took training  sessions with local secretaries and  chairpersons. Yet she never saw  herself as anyone of outstanding  ability. She never realised how  relevant and important she was to the  republican struggle. Her enemies  obviously did.  Of course to republican activists  throughout the North, whether or not  dicy came into personal contact with  Sheena, she remains the architect of  what came to be known as the  Torrent Strategy', named after the  local by-election in the Torrent ward  of Dungannon in (date). But it  should really have been named the  'Upper Bann strategy', since this is  where this professional, systematic  approach to election work was  developed, or, perhaps more  appropriately, the SheenaCampbell  strategy', since she developed it. In  the constituency tiiat she worked in,  and the wards she was brought into  to direct operations, Sheena ended  years of amateurish, haphazard  election work and helped election  workers schedule their work, record  their findings and complete all the  tasks effectively and efficientiy.  Brendan recalls in amazement  how she turned the situation around  in die Torrent ward, getting Francie  Moiloy elected against the odds.   She went into Tyrone, and you  know how parochial they can be  down there, and she took control and  chastised them all, and in the end got  Francie elected. She even got  Brendan Doris - 'Basil' to his friends      to wear a tie, well, at least to carry  one in his pocket at all times.   Sheena had planned everyone's  timetable in detail, and Francie  remembers how one day, as he had  asked her how she thought things  were going, she said,  Everything  is fine, but you shouldn't disappear  for an hour when there is work to be  done .  I thought she  hadn't noticed that I had  slipped out to get abreak.  She didn't miss  anything .  But the workers got  their own back. She used  to tell canvassers off for  spending too long  chatting on the doorsteps.  On a canvass with  Seamus Nugent, Jim  McAllister and Brendan  Curran, she decided to  show them how it was  done.  Anybody in? ,  she shouted into the  house. But the farmer  was at his work in the  cowshed.  I can't hear  you,  he shouted back.   Sheena, who as always  was immaculately turned  out, had to wade through  several inches of cow  manure in her high heels  to deliver her election message,   Jim McAllister recalls.  That was  die end of her canvassing for that  day .  At the end of last year Sinn F6in's  education department decided to run  workshops for election workers,  based on the Torrent     on Sheena  Campbell's      Strategy. Some of us  were asked to prepare  an   education   pack  based on it. We had  anticipated we would  spend  a  few  hours  talking   to   Sheena,  then write it all down,  structure it and lay it  out in point form. To  our surprise     we  didn't know Sheena  that   well   then        Sheena arrived with a  folder,      containing  pages     of     points,  already itemised, with  tables,diagrams,main  ideas highlighted and  summarised. We were  surprised    on    two  counts:      such      a  systematic,  professional approach  had never been Sinn  Fein's    forte,     and  secondly        Sheena  looked so young, so unassuming, the  'wee girl' from the Ardowen estate  in Craigavon. We quickly realised  we  were  in  the  presence of a  formidable activist.  Sheena went back to study in  1988, in Lurgan Tech' where she  took aGCSE in Sociology. She then  moved to Newry Tech', which now  forms part of the University of  Ulster campuses, to do a two year  foundation course. She was the first  student from Newry to be accepted  into the Law Faculty at Queens,  well-known for the high standards  it demands of entrants. She had been  told by the Careers Guidance people  at Queens that she  hadn'tahope.   The students in her tutorial group  had three and four A's in their 'A'  Levels. Yet they looked up to her to  lead the way in discussions. Sheena  did well in her exams, but spent  nearly as much time helping other  students as with her own work,  forever lending out notes, giving a  hand, encouraging. The teaching  staff recognised this and credited her  with exam successes other than her  own.  A brilliant student, with  tremendous academic ability,  is  how they described Sheena.  She had not decided yet which  aspect of law she would like to  specialise in, but she enjoyed EEC  and constitutional law. Yet she had  no intention of making a money-  spinning career out of it. Alone in  her tutorial group she believed that  law was meant to benefit humanity,  not a lawyer's bank account.  Brendan Curran was shot by  loyalists in October 1989. Sheena  drove to the hospital where she  waited all night outside the  operating theatre, the first to speak  to Brendan when he came to. From  diere she drove on to the Sinn F6in  Advice Centre which she opened,  just like every morning, at 9am.   She would not let them think that  they had broken the back of die  organisation.   Sheena Campbell  Brendan puts his quick recovery  down to her. She got him back on  his feet in weeks, nursed him, drove  him to meetings. When her studies  started to take more of her time,  Brendan becamethehouse-husband,  looking after CaoUn when she went  to lectures, cooking while she  worked on assignments, or relaxed  playing the piano, or read, or played  Scrabble with friends. The games of  Scrabble would last for hours, as she  pondered over triple words. Jim  McAllister and Francie Moiloy  allege she cheated. Of course, they  would   they lost every game.  Go  on Francie, challenge that word.  Sure you have nothing to lose    Sheena's words still ring out  in  Francie's ears as he remembers that  game, which he resoundingly lost.  Many of Sheena's close  comrades became her personal  friends. Visibly shattered last  Sunday, several recalled how  Sheena had helped them through a  bad patch, how you could always  talk to her about anything, political  or personal, how she would read  between tlie tines and in a few words  put a problem in perspective,  managing to tell them if she thought  diey were wrong without causing  offence, a rare friend indeed. The  tears rolling down many people's  cheeks at her graveside last Sunday  told dieir own story.  Sheena packed so much in her 29  years tiiat it is as difficult to  understand why she never saw her  own value and importance, as it is  easy to see why she became a target.  Bom a woman, a nordiem  nationalist, growing into a  republican, she moved out oi the  ghetto oi second-class citizenship, a  croppie who would not lie down. A  mother, a lover, a friend, a comrade,  she will be mourned and missed for  many years to come, yet she will live  on, in die solid foundations that she  built for Sinn Fein activists, in the  memories oi the many that worked  with her, and most of all in the hearts  oi her family and friends.  All we, who are proud to have  been her comrades, can doy is make  sure that the hope she earned, we  carry in our hearts, and that the work  she started is built upon.  Family and Friends  Join Together in Silent Vigil  The parents and sister  of Sheena Campbell,  the Sinn Fein member  murdered by the  loyalist Ulster  Volunteer Force in a  Belfast hotel last  week, joined her  friends in a silent  vigil.  Ms. Campbell was shot  minutes after leaving  Queen's University library to join  friends in the York Hotel on Botanic  Avenue.  Two other people were wounded,  but not seriously injured, when the  loyalist gunman fired at the 29-year-  old mother of one, who was a law  student at the university.  Jean Fegan's eyes filled with  tears as she spoke of her daughter.   She knew her life was in danger but  it did not keep her from her work.  She was aware of the danger but she  was dedicated.   We are very, very proud of our  daughter. It is so sad that the people  who killed her did not have a chance  to talk to her. She would have  listened to their points of view and  argued her own point,  said Mrs.  Fegan.  Craigavon councillor Brendan  Curran, the murdered woman's  boyfriend, was among 25 Sinn Fein  members and councillors from  around the north who attended die  vigil outside the hotel.  Mr. Curran said the aim of the  vigil was to protest at the killing of  partner Brendan Curran looks on as  Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness drape her  coffin with the national nag  Sheena Campbell and other  members of the party.   This vigil is an opportunity for  Sinn Fein to highlight the role of  those who constanUy seek to  marginalize and demonize our party  and by their actions and their words,  create an atmosphere in which  members of Sinn Fein, our families  and supporters, can be targeted for  assassination,  he said.   No other party in Ireland or  Britain has suffered more tiian Sinn  Fein in the last 20 years.   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams  earlier said,  Elements in the media,  die churches, and some political  parties which  demonize  Sinn Fein  cannot escape responsibility for die  murder of Sheena Campbell.*'  The Sinn Fein President, in an  angry statement, spoke about ktiie  consequences of the British efforts  to demonize republicans.   He also said it remained his  conviction that the republican  struggle had the capacity to wear  down and to defeat the British  government.   None of the measures  introduced by tlie British  government, and mis  includes the censorship  laws, have defeated the  republican struggle.  Rather, they have served  only to perpetuate the  conflict with dire  consequences for all  sections of our people and  to add to the burden of  oppression weighted  down upon nationalists  and republicans.   Patrick Mayhew*s attempts to  put on a brave face does nothing to  change this. He himself concedes  that Sinn Fein support remains  significant and solid and all his  predecessors have admitted that the  IRA cannot be defeated. It is only a  matter of time until Mayhew or  Mates is forced to give further  expression to this reality.   They know they cannot win.  Therefore, rather than condemn us  all to further suffering, the London  and Dublin governments should  seek a new agreement to end  partition and to enlist international  assistance to break the deadlock.  This should be die aim also of all  parties claiming to represent  nationalist opinion.   In a tribute to Sheena Campbell  who was murdered at the weekend  by die UVF, Mr. Adams described  her as  a compassionate  Irishwoman, a motiier, a student and  committed Irish republican who  sought a peaceful Ireland which  would reflect the aspirations of all  our people and fulfill their needs.
