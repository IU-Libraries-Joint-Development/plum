ON        r    lt;N  x:  o  W  a,  O  w  a,  CO  2  w  H  oo   lt;U  60  C3  Shooter's  JANUARY 7th 1982 was the sixtieth anniversary of  the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922. This  so-called treaty divided Ireland down the middle, it turned  brother against brother, father against son and wife against  husband. The Free Staters called it 'the seeds of peace';  it was, in fact, England's divide and conquer policy designed  to get Irishmen at each other's throats.  For sixty years we have witnessed eternal war, bitterness, apathy  and the war in Ireland being carried  on, in the words of Lord Birkenhead, 'with an economy of English  lives'. The Treaty sowed the seeds  of civil war, jailings, executions,  hunger-strikes, emigration, 'cat and  mouse' policies, houndings, blacklists and terror of every description,  carried out in the name of law and  order.  In the old days, when the Anglo-  Normans first arrived, the Irish people  fell into three camps. The first camp  held the 'loyal' Irish; those who would  sell their own mother for a shilling, jumped  on the English bandwagon, crept with  cap in hand .ind cringed for land, property  and wealth.  Tho second camp held the 'rebel'  Irish; those who did not care where the  English robbed, raped and burned or  set up their pale, as long as it was not  on their property. They did not run to  the aid of the besieged people of Wexford,  Waterford or Dublin. Worse still, they came  with cap in hand to bow on bended knee  before England's King Henry II in Dublin's  College Green. Irish kings, princes and  church prelates kissed the hem of Henry's  gown and proclaimed him lord and master  of Ireland on condition that he allowed  them to hold on to their own titles and  lands.  The third camp hold what the English  doscribed as the 'wild' Irish. These were  the separatists, the people who refused  to accept Henry, the English or the annexation of Ireland into the foreign kingdom.  REMAINED  Down eight hundred and thirteen years,  the three  camps  romainod.   Even  in  the  days that they call 'the four glorious  years' (1917-21) the three camps remained  as they still remain today.  The 'loyal' Irish are all around us,  not just in the North but in the South as  well. The 'rebel' Irish are those who do  not care a straw as long as it does not cut  across their rich, petty lives. The 'wild'  Irish will never die; men and women  motivated by love, by ideals, by truth  and by justice will always shine far above  the self-seekers.  After the Battle of the Boyne, the big  question in Ireland was: 'Who are you for?  William or James?' Today the big question  in Ireland must be: 'Where do you stand?  For harp or for crown?' Those who wear  the crown above the harp on their caps  have chosen the crown's side     the side of  England. But there are others who do not  wear caps or uniforms and do not show  badges on their clothes but in their hearts  have crowns bigger than those in the  Tower of London.  Charles Dickens, in his book 'A Tale  of Two Cities', gives a good description   of Shooter's Hill. Sometimes I find it  hard to understand Dickens: the 'Tale  of Two Cities' is dedicated to Lord John  Russell who we remember as the famine  boss of England who allowed four million  of our people to starve to death or take  the coffin ships to America. He was the man  who gave the poor of England to the Poor  Law committees and those committees  drove thousands of Irish people out of  England and sent them back to Ireland to  die in the gutters of Dublin and theboreens  of the countryside.  TWO CITIES  My story on Shooter's Hill is also a  'tale of two cities': the city of Dublin and  the city of London.  The first time I put my foot on English  soil   was   in   the   early   fifties.   The   lion  THREE SHOUTS  ON A HILL  by Eamonn MacThomais  'SHOO TER 'S HIL L' is the eighth article  in the occasional series 'Three Shouts on  a Hill' by Eamonn Mac Thomais, in each  of which he recalls personal and historical memories associated with a different  hill and then gives three 'shouts' on any  subjects of his choice.  was roaring wildly. Threadneedle Street  was a hive of pin-stripe suits, bowler hats,  brief-cases and brollies. India House,  Lloyds', Barclay's, Scotland Yard, St.  James' Palace, Hyde Park and the Tower  of London. St. Paul's, Westminster, Regent  Street, Charing Cross and Wormwood  Scrubs. Boot-blacks, organ-grinders and the  horse-chestnut man at every corner. In the  side streets were a million huckster shops.  Turn a corner and out again to fashionable  Georgian houses with big motor cars outside every door.  As I walked around, gazing about, I  found myself outside the Home Office. I  stopped to think of bygone days. The  London  bobby  asked  me  if  I   was lost.   Yes,  I replied,  I'm lost. I'm looking  for two men, Arthur Griffiths and Austin  Stack. They passed by here in 1921.  Griffiths said to Stack: 'How would you  like to take home that building with you  Austin?'    What is it?' asked Austin. 'It's the  Home Office,' said Griffiths. 'Surely,'said  Stack, 'you're not thinking of anything  else except a republic?'  'Oh,'  said   Griffiths,   7  think   the  British terms are very good.'    'But how could we accept the British  king?' said Stack. 'Look at the dead  who have given their lives for the Irish  republic' 'Oh, I see. It's your conscience  that is the matter', said Griffiths.    When did you say your friends passed  by this way?  the London bobby asked  me.   July 1921,  I replied.  They passed  by this place twice, once together and  another time with Desmond FitzGerald.   The bobby looked me over very hard  and then decided l was joking and he said:   It would take a bit of shifting to lift  that building over to Ireland they'd need  more than a few hundred-ton cranes.    No , said I,  they moved it with a  gold fountain pen and royal blue Waterman's ink     the ink that doesn't fade,  or turn brown with age.   The bobby strolled on muttering to  himself about gold  fountain  pens, royal  blue Waterman's ink and ghosts of 1921.  I went into the Home Office and asked to  see the Roger Casement diaries. The men  in the pin-stripe suits were very nice and  civil but they were not sure if the diaries  were there or over in Whitehall. I waited  in vain.   Awfully sorry, sir, leave your name  and address and we will contact you in  due course.   I never did get to see the Casement  dia-ies yet I tried on at least four occasions.  But Michael Collins saw them and he agreed  with the British that the diaries were in  Casement's handwriting. These were the  diaries that the English had forged to send  Sir Roger Casement to the gallows. The  diaries are locked away now, not to be  seen until the year 2016.  The last deal was:  Here's the quicklime dust for Casement's body. Bury him  in Dublin and not in Murlough Bay   (Casement's request),  and shut your  mouths  about   the  diaries.    Mackey   is  dead, Nolan is dead, who now will become  Roger Casement's champion?  I came out of the Home Office and made  my way to Hans Place and Cadogan Gardens      the two places where the English first  made their divisive tactics. One half of the  Irish delegation was put in Hans Place and  the other half was put in Cadogan Gardens.  Both out of touch with each other. Why  not a hotel for the entire delegation?  No. The English plan was well thought out.  The next move was to split up Collins  and Griffith. ' Come with me Mr. Collins,  down to Sir Victor Sasoon's beautiful  home for the weekend.' 'Come with me,  Mr. Griffith down to my house at  Chequers/  Off they went to be wined and dined  and fooled and brow-beaten and brainwashed in evening dress, with solid silver  knives and forks and white linen tablecloths, duck, salmon, roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, Napoleon brandy and  music. A long, long way from the day that  Collins grabbed the coat of the 'Daily  Mail' reporter and told him that his paper  had called Collins a murderer.  The stage was now set for the final  act. All the props were brought into  position. First, the Pope in Rome; then  the insult to the king of England; then  the crown; then the North, then the  Orangemen; then the battleships; then  the terror; then the threats of 'terrible  war', then the letter to Craig; the phone-call  to the admirals at Holyhead. Sign, sign,  sign, sign, sign. The gold fountain pen  and the bowl of royal blue Waterman's  ink.  PROPS  The stage was set in Dublin also. The  props were out. The Dante celebrations;  peace; home from being on the run;  secret training; Croke Park picture-taking;  all united together, all as one; Larkin's  code     each for all and all for each.  It was a solemn moment as the gold  fountain pen was filled with the royal  blue Waterman's ink. The script for eternal  war was ready, the red blotting paper  under the first line. Two lines of men,  two cities     Dublin and London; two  peoples     Irish and English. One treaty      England's divide and conquer policy.  'Sign now, gentlemen'.  When the signing was over, Collins  spoke the first words:  Gentlemen, I have  signed my own death warrant.   Oh, if only Collins had remained in the  same frame of mind that he was in the day  he was going to sock the man from the  'Daily Mail'. Oh, if only the delegation  had not allowed itself to be divided. Why  didn't the entire republican cabinet go  over to London? Why did they accept  what they had previously rejected, in  July? Or was it more than the July offer?  Lloyd George had convinced Collins  that the unionists would have only two  and three-quarter counties.  Just imagine,   said Lloyd George,  Craig will be the prime  minister of the two and three-quarters  counties     the joke of the political world.   Collins signed thinking that the Boundary    Commission    would    give   Tyrone,.  Fermanagh, and parts of Derry and Armagh  to the Free State.  SIX COUNTIES  When the Boundary Commission was set  up the unionists wanted to take the whole  province of Ulster     Cavan, Monaghan  and Donegal were to be added to the other  six counties. The Boundary Commission  broke up in a big row over the border-line.  Then the unionists did their homework.  'If we take the nine counties the nationalists will have the majority. Let's make a  new border-line taking in the six counties  and with a good gerrymander system we      will reign forever.'  It wasn't until 1925 that the new agree-      MICHAEL COLLINS   ARTHUR GRIFFITH  wined, dined and brainwashed  ment was signed in England by Cosgrave,  Higgins and Blythe and the entire six  counties were handed over to Britain and  the unionists lock, stock and barrel. This  agreement, which also included the paying  of Free State money as compensation for  the burnings by the British Black arid  Tans was called, by Cosgrave, 'the seeds  of peace'.  The injustice of the whole affair, from  the signing of the so-called treaty to the  last financial agreement in 1926, and then  the betrayal by de Valera in 1927, was  enough to drive some of our best sons  and daughters across the waters into  exile in America and Canada. Those  who did not leave of their own free will  were driven out by the 'cat and mouse'  policy and by coercion acts.  Whoever goes to America to preach,  whether it's Mr. Paisley or Mrs. Paisley  or whether it's Mr. Donlon, Mr. Hume or  Mr. Taylor, they all must remember  that the Irish-Americans, on the whole,  are made up of the men and women,  the sons and daughters, and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the  coffin ships of famine times; the descen  dants of the Fenians; the descendants of  the Easter Week 1916 people; the descendants of Black and Tan Ireland; and the  descendants of the republican side ofthe  Civil War.  JOY  My first shout on Shooter's Hill is one  of joy that the federal policy has been  dropped by Sinn Fein. Did the unionists  not try the idea of the nine-county parliament for themselves in 1922, but quickly  saw it did not suit them and dropped it  like a hot potato? What they did not  accept in 1922 they are not going to  accept in 1982.  The enemy is the enemy of old      the British government and their crown  forces in Ireland. When they withdraw,  the differences between Protestants,  Catholics, unionists, nationalists and republicans can only be solved in the realities  of a united Ireland.  My second shout on Shooter's Hill is  to Margaret Thatcher. The British press  and the BBC showed us your tears and told  us that you were a mother first when your  son was lost in the desert. Six days of  tears you had, Mrs. Thatcher, and then  your son came home.  During your hours of tears did you  think for one moment of the Irish mothers  whose sons died on hunger-strike in the  H-Blocks? Mothers whose sons would never  come home again.  My third shout on Shooter's Hill is  to republican prisoners everywhere. My  shout is a shout of hope. You are not  alone in your cell, there are thousands  across the world who, each day, in their  minds are with you and beside you, in  spirit, prayers, hopes and wishes. Maybe  they don't all write letters or send cards  but they are still out here taking pride  in your courage and your sacrifice.  In the old days, in the Curragh concentration camp, we got letters and cards  from people who adopted us prisoners.  I remember being adopted by three schoolgirls. Helen in San Francisco, Colleen in  New York, and Harriet in Boston.  They told me that the schoolteacher  had put our names on the blackboard and  each pupil was told to pick a name. And  my three 'motts', as I called them, sent  me the most beautiful cards which I  proudly pinned up over my bed. Whenever I was down in the dumps I used to  look at my cards and the feeling that  someone cared lifted me higher than the  barbed wire.  Why don't you, dear reader, 'adopt'  a prisoner? Send a letter or a postcard.  If you are a schoolteacher, why not get  a class to pick a prisoner? A glossy postcard can turn a bleak cell wall into an  art gallery.  Tl  to  VO  H  X  w   gt;    lt;  2  00  X  *0  W  O  *0  r  w  o  cr  to  -j  VO  OO  to     INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY, which occurred last Monday, March  8th, was again highlighted by a series of activities organised over the weekend by anti-imperialist women in Belfast, Armagh and Dublin, focusing on  the situation of the women political prisoners in Armagh jail.  Traditionally, International Woman's     contributions   to    the       BERNADETTE McALISKEY  Day is a day on which women throughout the world join together to comm-  ommorate and celebrate their participation in tho struggles against oppression. In  the North, until recontly, the organised  women's movement has ignored the  crucial question of women's contribution to the struggle against the British  presence, but last weekend as in the  lost   three   years delegations   from  support groups and feminist organisat  ions in Britain converged along with anti-  Imperialist contingents from Belfast and  Dublin to picket Armagh jail, as a suit  able climax to u weekend spent reflecting the reality of the daily struggles of  nationalist women in occupied Ireland.  Last Saturday, March 6th, a photographic exhibition was held m the  Felons' Club in Andersonstown, in  west Belfast, which concentrated on the  daily lives and struggles of Irish women,  in ordinary life and in the armed  struggle. Comprising photographs, documents, posters, letters, profiles and  poems, the exhibition examined women's  to the community,  playgroups, mother and toddler groups,  tenants' associations, etc.; as well  as women in armed struggle, women  political activists, and women Volunteers who have died on active service.      GRETA REEL  received a bouquet from a Volunteer  The exhibition illustrated the tremendous progress achieved by women in  the North, especially since 1969, in  organising themselves in opposition to  British rule, thus breaking down sexist  barriers and advancing their own emancipation.  At a similar photographic exhibition  the same day, held in Trinity College,  Dublin, over one hundred women  attended the display entitled  Binlids and  Barricades'. Organised by Sinn Fein's  women's affairs department, the display  comprised sixty-four panels of photographs, text and posters illustrating the  role Irish women have played in the last  twelve years.  FUNCTION  On Saturday evening in west Belfast,  at a function held in the St. James'  community centre for the feminist  delegates from Britain, a woman IRA  Volunteer (one of several armed Volunteers present) read out a statement,  which said in part:   We, the Volunteers of Oglaigh na  hEireann. extend solidarity greetings to  women   involved in liberation struggles  throughout the world    We will ensure  that when victory is ours, and it will be,  that the women of Ireland will receive  full and equal recognition in all aspects  of Irish life.   There are no avenues of advancement closed to women within the Irish  Republican Army. We receive full and  equal recognition. Any promotion in the  ranks of this army will be gained by  individual effort and courage. We ask  nothing more and will accept nothing  less. Petty prejudices and sexism are  luxuries that we in the IRA cannot  afford, nor do we want.   Another Volunteer made a presentation of a bouquet of flowers to Greta  Reel, whose eightieth birthday occurred  last week, and who remains a dedicated  and active member of the Beechmount  Sinn Fein cumann.  PICKET  The following day, the picket of  Armagh jail by busloads of supporters  travelling from Belfast and Dublin  became the focus of the weekend's  activities.  As in previous years, scores of RUC  men cordoned off the main entrances to  the jail, but, unperturbed and in high  spirits, the crowd listened as solidarity  messages were read out from support  groups abroad.  Several   poems   written   by   Armagh  protestors were read out, and then a  statement was read by Maria Mc  Clenaghan, from Ardoyne in north  Belfast     recently released from Armagh  after five years as a protest prisoner. She  described the prison authorities'  constant petty harassment of the women  prisoners, and called for continued support until the five demands are  achieved.  Bernadette McAliskey attacked the  mainstream women's movement in Ireland for its continuing reactionary attitude to the Armagh prisoners, which in  turn aided and abetted British policy on  Ireland. Adding that it was these prison  ers who were the true champions of  women's rights     not those who adorned the polite tea parties of the women's  political associations     she said:  We  owe the prisoners an assurance that this  struggle and the women's struggle will be  further on when they walk out of  Armagh. Victory must be theirs, not  a victory which their grandchildren must  fight for.   The enthusiastic crowd dispersed  after chanting out the name of each  protesting prisoner, in deafening shouts  that penetrated the grim, grey wall* of  Armagh jail. International : Women's  Day has been fittingly commemorated  once again.
