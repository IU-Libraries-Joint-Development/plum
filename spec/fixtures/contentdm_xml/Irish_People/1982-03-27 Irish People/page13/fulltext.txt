 JC  Danny Cm  ZJQf  During the Penal Days, the  laws that were in operation debarred Catholics from Parliament,  any government office - high or  low - from entering the legal  profession, and from holding  commissions in the armed forces.  This was done by enforcing oaths  for all these professions which i  no Catholic could take - oaths  such as the following:  I do solemnly and sincerely  in the presence of God,  profess, testify and declare,  that I do believe, that in  the sacrament ofthe Lord's  Supper there is not any  transubstantiation of the  elements of bread and wine  into the body and blood of  Christ, at or after the consecration thereof by any person whatsoever and that  the invocation, 6r adoration     ofthe virgin Mary, or any  other saint, and the sacrifice  of the Mass, as they are  now used in the church of  Rome, are superstitious and  idolatrous...  These oaths practically closed  all paths of advancement to Catholics in public life. To encourage  among the Anglo-Irish ardor on  behalf of the law, the Anglo-  Irish Parliament in 1705 passed  a resolution  that the persecuting  of and informing against a Papist  is an t honourable service.  A  Catholic was forbidden to own  a horse of greater value than five  pounds. Standish O'Grady tells  the story of a Catholic gentleman  ofthe County Meath, who, having driven four bloodhorses into  the assize town, was there held  up by a Protestant and tendered  twenty pounds for his four valuable horses, whereupon he drew  out a pistol and shot the animals  dead. Ever after, he drove into  town behind six oxen - his mute  protest against  law .  Incidents  like this,  says O'Grady, aroused  and fed the indignation which  eventually compelled the annulment of the law.  Lecky writes:  The influence  of the code appeared, indeed,  omnipresent It blasted the prospect of the Catholic in all struggles  of active Hfe. It cast its shadows  over the inmost recesses of his  home. It darkened the very last  hour of his existence. No Catholic, as I have said, could be  guardian to a child; so the dying  person knew that his children  must past under the tutelage of  Protestants.   However, the Protestant Ascendancy could not feel safe while  Catholics owned any sizeable  proportion of landed property.  Even after the confiscations following the Williamite victory,  Catholics still retained about  14  ofthe land A system was  devised, by acts passed in 1704  and 1709, which made it illegal  for Catholics to buy land at all,  or to take leases for longer than  31 years, and which at the same  time brought so many pressures  and prohibitions to bear on Catholic landowners, that by 1778  scarcely 5  of Irish land was in  Catholic possession.   After Limerick,  writes  Edmund Burke in his Tracts -  that is, after the Irish had, by the  faith and honor of the British  Crown, been pledged protection  in their lives, liberties, and property -  there was not a single  right of nature or benefit of  society which had not been either  totally taken away, or considerably impaired   The historian Lecky admits  that it was more through rapacity  than fanaticism that the English  and Anglo-Irish so ferociously  oppressed., repressed, and robbed  the Irish Catholics of both their  moral and material rights. He  goes on to say that fear of the  conquered people ever again  taking rank with their conquerors  likewise inspired the persecutions.  His words are:  It was intended  to make them poor and to keep  them poor, to crush in them  every germ pf enterprise and  degrade them into a servile race  who could never hope to rise to  the level of their oppressor.   r 3  mum mm  THURSDAY 11th March marks the one hundred and twenty-  fifth anniversary of the birth in 1857 of Fenian revolutionary  Thomas J. Clarke, the first signatory of the 1916 Proclamation.  Thomas Clarke, was born in  Hurst Castle on the Isle-of-Wight,  where his father was stationed as a  sergeant in the British army. Both  his parents were Irish. Shortly after  his birth the family emigrated to  South Africa, where they spent eight  years, before returning to settle in  Dungannon, County Tyrone in  1865.  At the age of sixteen, Clarke and  another youth formed a nationalist  club in the town, out of which an  Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB)  circle was formed. In 1880 he  emigrated to the United States and  joined Clan na Gael, the American  wing ofthe IRB.  BOMBING  Three years later Thomas Clarke  recrossed the Atlantic, this time to  England, as part of a Clan na Gael  bombing team. Under the alias of  'Henry Wilson' he operated in  Liverpool, Birmingham and London  in the dynamite campaign against  public buildings and railway stations.  But, after only a short time in  England, Clarke was arrested, stood  trial at the Old Bailey charged with  treason-felony, and in June 1883,  at the age of twenty-six, was sentenced  to  penal servitude for life.  For the next fifteen and a half  years he was imprisoned, mainly in  Chatham prison, under conditions  of deliberate horror, designed, sometimes successfully, to destroy the  sanity of the 'special' Irish prisoners.  His   account   of  this   period   was  afterwards recorded in a series of  articles in the newspaper 'Irish  Freedom' and later expanded into a  booklet entitled 'Glimpses of an  Irish Felon's Prison Life'     one of  the classics of Irish republican prison  history.  In September 1898, Thomas  Clarke was freed and returned to  Ireland, but the following year again  returned to the United States, where  he married Kathleen Daly, and  continued his activities in Clan na  Gael. In 1903, the first issue of a  weekly newspaper, the 'Gaelic  American', appeared with John  Devoy as editor and Thomas Clarke  as assistant editor and manager. It  became an influential and widely-  read journal.  RE-ORGANISATION  In 1907, Thomas Clarke returned  to Ireland and set up a tobacconist  and newsagent's shop at 75a Great  Britain Street (now Parnell Street),  which became a centre of nationalist  activity. Clarke set about the reorganisation of the IRB, and in  1910, with Sean MacDiarmada  as manager, he published 'Irish  Freedom', a militant newspaper  which advocated the use of physical  force to win freedom for Ireland.  In July 1911, Clarke organised  the first national pilgrimage to the  grave of Wolfe Tone in Bodenstown,  County Kildare. Three years later,  on June 21st 1914, he delivered the  oration there himself and, a man of  few words, confined himself to a  warning that the time for speech-  making had passed and that the  urgent need was for drilling and  training in the use of arms.  In September 1914, after the  'Great War' had begun, Clarke and  the other members of the IRB's  Supreme Council took a formal  decision to organise an insurrection  in Ireland before the war ended. A  year later Clarke became a member  of the IRB's Military Council set  up    to    plan    that    undertaking.  RISING  The culmination of the IRB's  plans, and of the role of Thomas  Clarke as the link between the  Fenians and the Irish Republican  Army, came at Easter 1916. Clarke,  because of his recognised historic  role, was given the honour of being  the first signatory to the proclamation declaring the Irish Republic.  During the Easter Rising he  fought in the GPO, and, after the  surrender, he was court-martialled  on May 2nd and sentenced to death.  The following day, May 3rd  1916, . with Padraig Pearse and  Thomas MacDonagh, he was shot in  Kilmainham jail.  On Irisii  Will Hold A  Live Ceili  Every Saturday  9:  .M.

UDR  McConnell, his brother Eric,  and William McClelland were  given life imprisonment for the  Turnly killing and for killing  Rodney McCormick, a Catholic,  who was shot dead in front of  his wife in Larne in August  1980. A number of other UDA  men were given lenient sentences for their parts in various  sectarian attacks. One of these  men, 26-year-old Matthew Martin, was a sergeant in the UDR,  the British army's regiment for  Loyalists, when he bombed a  Catholic school in Ballyclare  and petrol bombed a house. He  received a mere five years' imprisonment after a 'plea for mercy' was made by a former Moderator of the Presbyterian church,  the Very Rev. Victor Lynas.  Despite a long and bloody  record of sectarian bombings,  North and South, and their involvement in the assassinations  of hundreds of Catholics, the  UDA remains an open, legal  organization in the six counties.
