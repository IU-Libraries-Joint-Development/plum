RecifooaL      V  The St Patrick's Day Parades  across America demonstrated  the growing support for the  struggle for Irish freedom. In  numerous cities this was shown  by naming Bobby Sands honorary  grand marshal.  The recent Newark parade  was no exception. Although Irish  Northern Aid and the Irish  National Caucus of New Jersey,  Inc. (as distinct from the  Washington-based Caucus) are  active and have a great deal of  support in the Newark area, the  parade leaders have consistently  taken a non-political stand This  year, however, Republican supporters showed their strength to  New Jersey  the Free State-loving officials.  Bridie Vesey from Rathmullen,  Co. Donegal, and her husband  Brendan from Ballaghadereen,  Co. Mayo, as Deputy Grand  Marshal and Assistant Adjutant  respectively, used their influence  to change the attitude of the  parade committee. As a result  of their efforts, when John  Brady of the Irish National  Caucus of New Jersey, Inc.,  made a motion to formally invite  Sean Sands and his family to  the parade, it was unanimously  approved. A big thanks to the  Vesey family for helping to put  the parade committee in the  right direction.  A little bit of Ireland took  over Hackensack last March  14th, as more than 2,500 ofthe  faithful marched in Bergen  County's first county wide St.  Patrick's Day parade. A bright  sun softened a stiff westerly  breeze that ripped at flags and  banners and chilled the estimated  8,000 spectators. The hour-long  parade followed 1  -mile route  down Main Street from Anderson Avenue to The Green,  opposite the courthouse. A  riderless horse honored Irish  Republican Army member  Bobby Sands and nine other  hunger strikers who died in a  North Ireland prison last year.  Sands was honorary grand marshal of the parade.  Bronx INA  The Bronx Unit of Irish  Northern Aid held a very successful social at the Broadstone Inn  last Friday evening. Sean Sands  held the audience captive and  will undoubtedly do so again at  the Riverdale Steakhouse, 259th  Street and Riverdale Avenue,  Bronx, Thursday evening,  March 25 th.  Irish music lovers will have a  double treat as Sean and Joe   Banjo  Burke contribute their  talent for the evening. There  will be a buffet, compliments of  proprietor Terry Connaughton.  Delaware Valley Chapters of INA  Presents  Philadelphia   The QE II  The Philadelphia City Administration apparently feels that Irish and Irish-       Americans haven't suffered enough...  Now our tax dollars are being spent to slap us in the face, by the  arrival of England's  pleasure  ship, the Queen Elizabeth II...  Demonstrate YOUR outrage   Sunday, April 25 th, 1982 at 1:00 P.M.  Packer   Delaware Avenues, Philadelphia, Pa.  For Information Call: 288-8298, 352-8148, 755-1069, (609)267-8098  The Delaware Valley Chapters of INA will demonstrate on  Sunday, April 25 th in protest  against the Philadelphia arrival  of the  Queen Elizabeth 2 ,  England's greatest shipbuilding  blunder since the  Titanic .  The protest starting at 1 p.m.,  at Packer and Delaware Ave. in  Philadelphia, will let the city  administration know that the  spending of tax dollars to welcome this carrier of England's  imperial flag is an outrage to  American citizens.  As Irish children continue to  be targets for British Army plastic-bullet gunmen, English foreign  office and economic bigwigs are  planning to impress the city that  is the cradle of hard-won American liberty. English accents and  a patronizing attitude toward   colonials  are all that the ill-  starred vessel has to offer, however. This is a ship that was outdated before its keel was laid.  Its turbines gave an embarrassing  black eye to British craftsmanship when they failed repeatedly  in trials. In service, at least two  serious breakdowns of machinery  and piping have left the hulk  wallowing dead in the sea, while  passengers took to boats or impatiently waited return of water  to bathrooms.  Aptly named, in view of the  dowdiness and lack of style of  its furnishings and accommodations,  Queen Elizabeth 2  is  seeking unwary cruise passengers  who will tolerate mutton in various disguises. Meanwhile, the  far superior food, accommodation,  service and attitude ofthe crews  of Dutch, Italian, Trench and  Scandinavian ships continue to  drain business from this  ship  of shame , as her own crew  took to calling her in disgust  some years ago.  Delaware Valley INA chapters ask support for the protest  Remember the Hunger Strike  Martyrs, and be present Sunday  afternoon. April 25th.  Rockland  Rockland County Irish Northern  Aid's monthly meeting will be  on Sunday March 28, 1982.  2:30 p.m., at the Celtic Inn, 51  Route 303, Tappan, NY.
