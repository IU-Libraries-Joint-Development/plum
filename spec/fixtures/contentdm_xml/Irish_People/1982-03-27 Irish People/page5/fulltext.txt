Americans drove the English from  their shores. They had their  Yorktown. The Irish still await  theirs.  In many ways, America owes  a debt of gratitude to the sons of  Erin, for 50  of George Washington's rebel army was composed of Irishmen. The British  government has officially said  so. American army muster rolls  say so. And precious few of  these Irishmen were so-called   Scotch Irish .  If we are to believe the official  records ofthe British government  including parliamentary debates,  America was lost through the  Irish. A review of American  muster rolls records the fact  that Southern Irish names dominated. English General James  Robertson testified before a British parliamentary committee  that  half of the rebel army was  from Ireland . General Clinton  wrote his government in London,   the emigrants from Ireland were,  in general, to be looked upon as  our most serious antagonists .  After the war was over, Lord  Mountjoy exclaimed in the House  of Commons,  America was  lost by Irish emigrants     Ireland  had America detached from her  by force ofthe Irish emigrants.

If he knew anything about  Ireland's problem, he would know  that it is a matter of denial of  civil and human rights that led  Bobby Sands to sacrifice his life  on a hunger strike to focus world  attention on the plight of his  people.  Why would a man proclaiming  to be Irish refer to those of his  own ethnic background as  this  minority ?? Is it because he's  so totally assimilated that he  has no ethnicity, or because he  was brought up on a diet of  In British Prison  ters to concern themselves and  use their influence to seek an  improvement in the inhuman  conditions and harassment under  which our brother, Patrick Hackett, has been subjected to for the  past six years in Brixton, Wormwood Scrubs and Wakefield jails  (confirmed by Amnesty International).

We, the family of Patrick  America's Debt  were in part made up ofthe Irish  brigade under Walsh and Dilloa  US Army archives report the  facts. They list 221 Irishmen  named Burke, 327 O'Connors,  695 Kellys, 331 McCarthys,  494 Murphys, 322 Ryans,-266  Sullivans, 178 0'Neils,231 O'  Briens, 243 Connellys and 285  Reillys, just to mention a very  few Gaelic names. These are  hardly the names of  Scotch  Irish  soldiers. Irishmen fought  British tyranny at Bunker Hill,  including men with such Gaelic  names as Colonel Dan Moore,  Captain Thomas McLaughlin,  Privates Dan McGrath, John  Barrett, Thomas Collins, George  Shannon, John Dillon, Thomas  Doyle and Dan Callahan.  Gaelic was commonly spoken  by rebel troops. George Washington became a member ofthe  Friendly Sons of St. Patrick  since so many of his troops were  Irish. Irish soldiers in the British  regiments immediately deserted  to the rebels on reaching America. The first rebel Congress  included Irishmen named Sullivan, Fitzsimmons, Duane, Carrol, McHenry, Hartnett Kearney and Heney, just to name a  few. Irish rebel generals included  James Hogan, John Kelley, John  Dooley, John Shea, Hercules  Mooney, Steven Moylan, all  Irish-born.  The Irish began arriving in  America as early as 1621, according to American archives. The  great Shenandoah Valley was  called the  Irish  tract long  before the Revolutionary War.  fortified stupidity?  The Irish are as downtrodden  today as they were and that is  attested to by the pro-British  slanted reporting by the media  and the closing down of an  exhibit on Irish history by an  individual in the Customs Dept  who, at the behest of a minor  official of the British Information  Services, informed us that unless  Ireland changes its history, he  will not allow the public to see  it.  Maureen O'Driscoll  Hackett, as contributors to the  up-keep of such ministers in  their influential positions, hope  that relevent ministers of the  present government will now  press their British counterparts  to reciprocate a like humanitar-  anism as has been evinced in  the Littlejohns' and Parkinson  cases - a gesture that will achieve  a tangible improvement in our  brother's confinement.

The famine emigration of the  1840s was actually the second  great flood of Irish immigrants.  The rebel army in Pennsylvania was called the  Irish Line   since it contained so many Irish  troops. Wexford-born John Barry  was called the Father of the  Rebel Navy.. Yes, there was a  small minority of Irishmen with  non-Gaelic names as well, but  they considered and called themselves Irishmen, not Scotch Irish.  They stood with solid patriots  like Wolfe Tone and McCracken,  Irishmen all.  Washington never referred to  the   Scotch Irish  as there were  none in those days. That term is  a recent invention. Ulstermen  contributed their proportionate  share in freeing America including the O'Dohertys, O'Neils,  O'Kellys, Maguires, etc., but  Southern Ireland supplied the  vast bulk of Washington's rebel  army. So much for the British-  created myth of the so-called   Scotch Irish .  Various Stormont governments  and the British government failed  to cite the fact that the families  of Presidents Grant, Wilson,  McKinley and others fled British  tyranny in the colonies. Their  English oppressors have, in recent years, enshrined the ancestral homes of the very people  they drove out of Ulster.  James C. Heaney  Buffalo, NY  To the Editor  On Thursday, March 11,1982  at about 9:15 p.m. (NY time),  the BBC broadcast a commentary  by one David Beresford called   Ulster Newsletter , apparently  a regular weekly feature. Mr.  Beresford was proclaiming from  Belfast the good news that the  people of  Northern Ireland   seemed to be coming to their  senses and at long last realizing  that  religion and politics don't  mix . The cause of this jubilation was the fact that the Rev.  Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party candidate in a Parliamentary by-election, Rev. William  McCrea, had run a poor third  -behind the second place candidate of the non-sectarian Alliance Party (David Cook) and  the winning candidate (with a  comfortable 5000 vote majority)  of the establishment Official  Unionist Party. This news was  celebrated as a step away from  the madness of sectarian politics back toward a more stable  and secular political life. But  what is the identity of this champion of non-sectarian, establishment common sense Unionism?  None other than the Rev. Martin  Smyth, the exalted Grandmaster  of the Orange Order   In his pamphlet The Battle  for Northern Ireland, the Rev.  Smyth, through some painfully  contorted reasoning,  proves   that it is the Catholics who have  terrorized the Protestants for  fifty years  Leon Uris (inIreland-  A Terrible Beauty, p. 183) calls  Martin Smyth  the real article,  a genuine uncomplex bigoL..mus-  cle-bound by his own medio  crity... . Maintaining the unmaintainable and rationalizing  the unrational, Rev. Smyth remains dedicated to the founding  principle of Orangeism: allegiance  to the Crown, upholding the  Protestant Ascendancy, and hatred of Catholics.  Mr. Beresford's delight it would  seem, is that the rough and redneck style of Paisleyite bigotry  has been forced to take a back  seat to the hoped-for and more  apparently respectable institutionalized discrimination ofthe   Gentlemen's Lodges .  The point is not whether or  not you accept the Irish Republican premise that it is the lesson  of history that the Irish nation  has made progress towards the  restoration of liberty and of national sovereignty in Ireland only  through physical force or the  threat of physical force. Nor is  the point the desirability ofthe  ultimate peaceful reunification  of Ireland. The point is that  whatever its good points, when  it comes to reporting on Ireland,  the BBC is mendaciously misstating the facts and is being  used plainly and simply as a  tool of English government propaganda in the very worst sense  of the term.  But then again, do we consult  Radio Moscow for the truth  about Poland? Where Ireland is  concerned it is the English who  are (as J. Edgar Hoover rightly  said of the Communists) the   Masters of Deceit .  Kenneth Tierney  Freedom for All Ireland Com.  AOH Westchester County     d  as  oo  o   lt; / gt;  H  X  m         lt;  GO  X  W  O  r  w      as   r  to    o  vo  oo  Senator Mathias  To the Editor:  Thank you for getting in touch  with me to express your concern  about S. 1639, the Extradition  . Act of 1981, which is currently  being considered by the Senate  Judiciary Committee. The bill  has been amended slightly and  reintroduced as S. 1940.  S. 1940 would replace our  outdated extradition law with a  codification of current case law  and practice in this area. The  bill would make one major change      it would authorize the Secretary of State, rather than the  courts, to decide whether the  offense for which extradition is  being sought is of a political  nature. If Congress adopts this  change, it will shift the determination of a  political offense   from a neutral, apolitical body  like the courts, to a proponent of  political policies in the Executive branch. This shift could  threaten long-established- norms  of due process and our long tradition of providing a refuge for  victims of political prosecution.  This proposed change has an  other potential disadvantage. To  place that decision with the Executive branch might force the  President to make judgments  that would cause embarrassment in his conduct of foreign  relations. Similar concerns  prompted us in 1976 to shift  from the Department of State to  the courts the decision on whether  or not to grant a foreign sovereign's request for immunity.  I will take a careful look at S.  1940 with these considerations  in mind, and will try to make  sure that it contains procedural  safeguards for the accused. In  fact I understand that the Administration itself is considering  amendments to S. 1940 that  would provide additional protection in this important area.  I appreciate your expression  of interest in the extradition bill.  You may be sure that I will have  your views in mind as the bill is  debated by the Committee and  the full Senate.  Charles McC.
