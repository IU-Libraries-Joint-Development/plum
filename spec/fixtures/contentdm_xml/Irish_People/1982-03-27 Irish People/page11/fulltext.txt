*.,  EritOi  You are now ready to make a classic entry into, the  Irish language, by way of an important verb: Ta(taw*).   Ta  serves to tell where something is or what its  condition is, and therefore it has some ofthe functions  of English  is .  For the (i) sound, put the front part of your tongue up  along the top of your mouth, with the tip against the  upper front teeth and almost- but not quite- protruding  between the teeth. Pronounce the (t) sound a few times.  If you extend the tongue too far between the teeth, you  will say the (th), a sound which Irish does not have.  For the (aw*) sound, say the word   tof' but start the  word with the Irish (t) you have just learned Repeat  several times, then drop the final  t*' and lengthen the  (aw*) sound. As a check, try making the (aw*) sound in  another way: say English   awful  several times slowly,  and notice that your lips are pushed far out Try the  word with your lips, held in closer and more rounded.  You may recognize the sound as the way some Irish  pronounce  awful .  Now learn these words, referring back to Lesson 1  pronunciation guide as necessary.  ta se (TAW* shay*) he is, it is  Practice on these: deil (del), dean (day*n), dliis  t   me (TAW* may*) I am  fuar (FOO-uhr) cold  m6r (mohr) big  te (te) hot  6g (ohg) young  sean (shan) old  Ian (law*n) full  Next learn these sentences, then translate them.

John is not fat  For questioning with  t-a , the basic group is  an  bhfuiT (un VWDL). In the West this may be pronounced  (un WIL). Read these:  An bhfuil fear ansin? (un vwil FAR un-SHIN) Is a man  there? AN bhfuil Nora og? (un vwil NOH ruh ohg) Is  Nora young? An bhfuil bosca anseo (un vwil BOHSK-  uh un SHUH) Is there a box here?  PRONUNCIATION  Irish t and d;- every Irish consonant has two different  sounds. The one selected depends on what kind of  vowel is next to the consonant The vowels  a ,  o ,  and  u  are called broad and give the broad sound to  the consonants next to them. The slender vowels are   e ,  i ,  ea , and often  ai .  You learned how to pronounce broad  t  above, in  the word  ta . Pronounce broad  d  with the front part  ofthe tongue in the same position, along the roof of the  mouth, with the tongue tip almost protruding between  the teeth. Try. dli(daw*), do(doh), dun(doon), drom   (drohm), dl(T(dloo), dath (dah).  For slender d and t, place the tongue tip, and only the  tip, on the hard ridge just behind the upper front teeth.  Then pronounce the  t  or d . (In the West there is a  tendency to pronounce these by sliding the. tongue off  the ridge, giving sounds closer to ch and j).  practice on these: deil (del), dean (day*n), dilis.  (DEE-lish), din (din), deacair(DAK-uhr),dlf(dlee),  te (te), teann (TAY*uhn) timire (TEEM-i-re), teas  (tas).  CONVERSATION  Read this carefully until you can go from one  language to the other quickly, phrase by phrase and  sentence by sentence. Do not try to understand the  grammar of the words or phrases yet Pay special  attention to  duit . This is generally pronounced with a  (g) sound at the start, and we will do that in this lesson.  The lettei u  in the word merely tells you that the  d   or  g  gets the broad sound The  t  must get a slender  sound  Sfamus (SHAY  -muhs): Dia duit a Ntira. (DEE-uh  git, uh NOH-ruh) Hello, Nora.  Nora: Dia's Muire duit, a Sheamais (DE uhs MWIR-  uh HAY*mish).  Hello, James.  Se'amas: Conas ta tu? (KUN-uhs TAW* too)  How are you?  Nora: T*fmego maith, agus conas ta tiffeln? (TAW*  may* goh MAH, AH-guhs KUN-uhs TAW* too  fay*n)  / am well and how are you?  Seamas: Ta me'go maith, leis. (TAW* May* goh  MAH, lesh)  / am well,' too.  H  X  Pi  2  X  hd  Pi  O  r  o   r  bo  oo  to  Irish Sugar Company Has Record Losses  The Irish Sugar Company,  one of the Free State's largest  state-owned companies, has announced losses of   12 million  for the year ending last September. This could mean substantial job losses in addition to the  threatened closure of the sugar  processing plant at Tuam, Co.  Galway.  The company wants the government to lend it   75 million, but  with Aer Lingus, B I, Nitrigin  Iiireann, Irish Steel and CIE already in the queue of financially  troubled state concerns, the Sugar  Company is unlikely to get the  sort of money it says it needs.  The Tuam factory, which employs 500, was saved from closure last year only by a government subsidy of   2.5 million.  The government gave in to considerable pressure from TDs  from the West.  But now it looks as if the  writing is on the wall for Tuam  as the set of accounts just issued  by the company shows a plant  write-off of   1 million at the  factory.  Also at risk are the factories  in Mallow, Middleton, Thurles  and Limerick, operated by the  company's subsidiary, Erin Foods.  At one stage last year, the  Sugar Company had debts of    90 million and most of the  losses are being incurred in meeting interest charges on these  borrowings.  There is also every indication  that losses this year will be even  worse.  Program  A modernization program has,  during the past five years, cost    40 million. The company says  another   50 million are required  to bring its operations   into the  eighties .  But the company's chairman,  James Fitzpatrick, has stated  forcefully in his report that there  can't continue to be an underwriting of activities for social  reasons     meaning maintaining  jobs because politicians don't  want lay-offs in their constituencies.  JUDGEMENT RESERVED IN DUBLIN SUPREME COURT'S SECTION 31 HEARING  Censorship in the balance  B Y DAMIEN O'ROURKE  THE Dublin Supreme Court has reserved judgement in the appeal by the  Free State government against the decision of the High Court declaring  Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act unconstitutional and quashing a bah  imposed by the Coalition Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on party  political broadcasts on RTE by Sinn Fein.  The   Supreme   Court   appeal   ended      cast    would be  likely  to promote, or  on Thursday 4th March after a three-  day hearing and it could be some weeks  before a ruling is made.  Two days before voting in the twenty-  six county general election, Mr. Justice  O'Hanlon in the High Court, agreed to  an application by Sean Lynch, Sinn  Fein candidate in Longford/Westmeath  to quash the order. He ci i so on the  grounds that Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1961, as amended  by Section 16 of the Broadcasting  Authority (Amendment) Act 1976, under  which the order was issued, is unconstitutional.  Among arguments by the Free  State Attorney-General, Peter Sutherland,  in the Supreme Court was the contention  that Sinn Fein had not challenged in th   -  lower court the minister's expressed  opinion   that  the party  political broad-  incite to, crime, or would tend to undermine the authority of the state.   In particular the Coalition Minister  for Posts and Telegraphs, Patrick Cooney,  had expressed the view to the court  that Sinn Fein was committed to overthrowing the institutions of the state  by force, and this, he said, had not been  contested in any way.  He pointed out that Sinn Fein was  not a registered political party in the  twenty-six counties nor would it take  any seats in Leinster House as it did  not recognise that institution of the  state.  He argued that the constitution only  contained a general guarantee of freedom  of speech and did not guarantee anyone the right of access to radio or  television.'  During   the   Attorney-General's   sub  missions one of the Supreme Court  judges, Mr. Justice Henchy, raised a  technical point as to whether the matter  of constitutionality should have been  considered by the High Court in the  circumstances.  On behalf of Sinn Fein's Sean Lynch,  Sean MacBride, SC, stated that at no  time had the state alleged that Sean  Lynch was doing anything illegal nor  proposing anything illegal in his election  literature or proposed broadcast.  He said that the Broadcasting Acts  did not come within the category of  laws expressed to be for the purpose of  securing public safety and the preservation of the state in time of war. Therefore they could not be construed as  authorising a minister to deprive a citizen  of his constitutional rights to freedom  of speech. He added that the Minister  for Posts and Telegraphs had not even  attempted lt; to find out the contents  of the Sinn Fein proposed broadcast  before he banned it.  He also submitted that Section 31  was unconstitutional on several grounds,  including    that    there   was   no   appeal  provided against a ban nor any procedural safeguards of ensuring that the  powers under the section were exercised  in accordance with the requirements  of constitutional justice.  Sean McBride said that the order  banning the party political broadcast  not only involved the constitutional  right to freedom of speech but also the  right to stand for election, which meant  access to the electorate and a right of  that electorate to be informed of what  the issues were in the election.  Two of the Supreme Court judges,  Mr. Justice Griffen and Mr. Justice  Hederman, referred to the speech of  Sinn Fein's Director of Publicity, Danny  Morrison, at the party's ard fheis last  October in which he referred to a ballot  paper in one hand and an Armalite  in the other, and they asked what that  might mean.  Patrick MacEntee, SC, who also  appeared for Sinn Fein, told the court  that the minister could not have formed  the opinion that Sinn Fein was an  integral part of the IRA; otherwise  steps would have been taken to suppress  the organisation.        SEAN MacBRIDE  'Section 31 is unconstitutional'
