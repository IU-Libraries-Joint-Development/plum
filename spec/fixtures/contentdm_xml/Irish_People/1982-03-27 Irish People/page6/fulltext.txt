James Wixted, a native of  Co. Limerick, was ordained for  the diocese of Portsmouth, England, where he labored as a  priest for forty years. Thirty  years of his priestly ministry  were spent in St. John Vianney  parish, Wantage, Oxfordshire,  a parish he founded in 1951. He  designed and helped build the  rectory and church towards which  the diocese had been able to  contribute only 500 pounds from  central funds. Like many other  Irish priests working in similar  areas, Fr. Wixted had relied on  family and friends in Ireland to  help financially. His own family  had contributed 10,000 pounds  and, during his thirty years in  the parish, he himself had not  drawn a formal salary. So far,  the Fr. James Wixted story is  typical of that of many Irish-  born priests and religious attached to dioceses in England,  Scotland and Wales.  In Memoriam  Fr. Wixted attracted national  attention by offering Masses for  the Price sisters when they were  being force fed while on hunger  strike, for the local MP Airey  Neave following his assassination and for Bobby Sands.  The Mass for Bobby Sands was  the subject of Mrs. Thatcher s  comment in the House of Commons:  This is a matter on  which a number of us feel very  deeply indeed, and why the feel  ings and thoughts of most of us  are with the victims of the Provisional IRA.  Tory MP Tom  Beynon complained to Fr. Wix-  ted's bishop, the Rt Rev. Anthony Emery, who is quoted  under the headline  Priest rapped  in row over Mass  in the Daily  Express of 5/11/81:  This can  be misinterpreted as condoning  what he has done. Any political  activity in connection with the  celebration of Mass is forbiddea   The summer after saying the  controversial Mass, Fr. Wixted  retired but returned to Wantage  after Bishop Emery issued a  statement saying that he had   honorably retired . This, Fr.  Wixted protested, was untrue.  He had, in fact, been forced into  early retirement because he had  offered a Mass for Bobby Sands.  The Irish Post (10/31/81) reports the events in the church in  Wantage following the statement  by Fr. Wixted:  Two male members of the congregation then  mounted the altar and attempted  to remove Fr. Wixted forcibly.  Two others intervened to protect  the priest and one ofthe assailants was heard to say: 'If you  don't get him out, I'll kill himV  The Irish Post reported also  that the diocese of Portsmouth  had conducted an internal inquiry  into Fr. Wixted's appeal against  early retirement Fr. Wixted  claimed the inquiry was incom-  Heirs: Mrs. Paisley, Ian Paisley and Peter Robinson  plete and was planning to meet  the Apostolic Delegate in London.  Hitler's Heirs  Actually, in one respect, Fr.  Wixted may have been lucky,  because he could have been  detained under the PT Act A  London-based nun     her name  is not given here for obvious  reasons     wrote recently in a  letter requesting the name and  address of some Senate members  in Albany:  Meanwhile, the Irish  in England are being treated  like German Jews under Hitler.  Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, Irish people are  hounded and humiliated, rushed  to gaol on the slightest pretext,  and can be kept for seven days...  Women especially are exposed  to obscenity and insult, having  no washing facility except a  public one where they are watched  by male warders. Could you  Irish-Americans pass on this  fact to the Vatican. You carry a  great deal of clout still.   The letter writer went on to  describe how the British Broadcasting Corporation portrayed  supporters of Irish Northern Aid  being interviewed in America  by BBC reporters:  In the program shows here, shots of Arma-  lite rifles and other weapons  were shown here and there in  conjunction with the text, thus  causing complete distortion of  the ideas presented.   (To be continued)  IT*  itumuL  A Question For  The Irish Tourist  Board?  St. Patrick's Day 1982 is  now history and in New York  the banners and flags are almost  dry. It was a line soft day in the  Big Apple. The green meanics  of past years were reduced to a  wet few, as New York's finest  kept a tight rein on the merrymakers, while I.A.D. (Internal  Affairs Division of the Police  Department) kept a sharp eye  on them. The weather also had  a dampening effect on the viewers  But as I headed north on Madison  from 42nd Street, I remembered  a snatch of song:  // ain't no use to grumble  and complain  It's just as cheap and easy to  rejoice  When God sorts out the weather and sends rain,  Why, rain's my choice.  So with this refrain sliding around  my memory I turned up my  collar and tightened my hat as I  turned west on 45 th Street  Purloined Potables  The warnings that had been  issued by the Police Department about public intoxication  were a reality as I watched a  couple oftri-color bedecked kids  having their potables purloined  by the P.D. I proceeded west as  the two youths headed east,  summonses in hand. The weather  aside, it would be a dry day for  these guys. As I neared Fifth  Avenue I began to realize that  the contingent I was passing  was all Noraid. The expectations  of a good turnout were a fact  and another page in the history  o( the hunger strike was being  written.  Bobby Sands,  Honorary' Grand  Marshal  The election of Bobby Sands  as honorary Grand Marshal would  not be soon forgotten, by Republican supporters and Free Staters  alike. This was evidenced by  the politician from Sligo who  sat on the reviewing stand as  Noraid went by. After a few furtive glances he went into his  imitation of an ostrich and if his  need for fresh air hadn't been a  priority, he would have missed  the remainder of the parade.  Our upwardly mobile mayor  did his best sidewalk act decked  out in an Aran sweater and I  Love New York muffler. He  flashed the thumbs-up signal of  the ASUs to the cheering throng.  If he doesn't succeed to Hughie's  Albany job he would be a natural for the male lead in a revival  of  Abie's Irish Rose .  TV Coverage  The TV coverage of the parade by WPIX included the Norr  aid marchers without any comment from the usually gregarious  Jack McCartny. I gliess job  security in these troubled times  must be an employee's paramount concern. I hate to say it  but old Jack wears the halter  well. And while we're on the  subject ofthe parade's coverage,  how about a hand for the spon  sors, Bord Failure and Aer-  Libelous, It wouldn't have been  the same without them. Another  thought comes to mind while on  the subject of those tre-foil tailed  Tories, what with the disclosure  recently by The Irish People of  documents pertaining to the Free  State's attempts at denying the  American public access to spokespersons ofthe Irish Republican  movement and the continuing  harassment of Noraid by the  American government as they  insist that the rapidly growing  Irish-American organization comply with the Foreign Registration Act Can anyone who attended a picket anywhere in this  country during the last year or  gave a donation of any amount  to help with the humanitarian  work ofthe Committee, or even  purchased a T-shirt, poster, pin  or bumper stick'    . travel safely  to Ireland ever again? Consider  this, if Noraid is forced by the  Federal government to comply  with Foreign Registration, you  by your support ofthe demands  of the hunger strikers, through  your appearance at a picket  rally or demonstration which  was sponsored by the Committee, will find yourself in a tenuous  position on your next visit to the  Sham-State. It's no secret that  the representatives of the Free  State tried to persuade participating parade contingents not to  march on the 17th in any American city that honored the memory of Bobby Sands and his heroic  comrades. Of course, this is nothing new for the Ath Cliath quislings, as they have tried over the  last decade to dissuade Irish-  Americans from supporting the  Noraid Committee or any other  group of opponents of their support of British oppression and  the maintaining of the status  quo in occupied Ireland. You  can be sure that the rejection of  their overtures will not be forgotten, no matter what Charlie  fork-tongued during his D.C.  visit. They don't like people  who don't agree with their collaborationist policies, and you  must realize what happens to  people who don't agree with  them ai home. So before you  book your trip, give them a call.  They're in the.book, and find  out if they will give assurances  against any attempts by the Special Branch to harass you or  yours when you visit  that special place, Ireland .
