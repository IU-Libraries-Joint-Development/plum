Aunust 9 - August 15. 2003  The Irish People  August 9 - August 15. 2003 Page 9  MEP harassed as case draws to a close  On Tuesday morning, following  the completion of the closing arguments of the prosecutor and the  solicitor general, Colombian  Genera  Enrique Mora, head of the  armed forces, issued a public statement vehemently calling for the  three defendants' convictions. In a  letter to the President of the EU  Parliament, Pat Cox, urging his  direct intervention with the  Colombian authorities, Fianna Fail  MEP Niall Andrews, who is attending the trial as an observer, wrote  that:  The timing of this highly prejudicial statement sends a clear and  sinister message to the court presiding over this trial that a judgment of  conviction should be rendered irrespective of the evidence.   On Sunday, Andrews w;is approached and  questioned in an intimidating manner as he left his  hotel by a man claiming to be from the police and  asked whal he was doing in the country. The man  made intimidating gestures. A short time later  another man took photographs of Niall Andrews  as he was getting into a taxi.     felt that there was some kind of psychological pressure being exerted,  said Andrews in a  statement.  I decided not to take the taxi to the  cathedral but rather to return to the hotel. As a  result I felt it was unsafe to leave the hotel alone.  I recalled similar incidents in Central America  years ago. I also feel that the whole process of  intimidation is counterproductive to the interests  of the Colombian State.   Caitriona Ruane, spokesperson for the Bring  Them Home Campaign, said:  This is unacceptable behavior from the Colombian Police and is  part of a pattern of harassment of the international  observers. I have sent a statement of this incident  to the Irish government and called on them to  make a formal complaint to the Colombian  Authorities.   In his letter to Pat Cox, Niall Andrews highlighted the high level interference in the trial.   From the moment of the men's arrest almost two  years ago, high-ranking officials in the Colombian  armed forces have repeatedly made well-publicized statements prejudging the defendants as  guilty. One such officer, General Fernandez  Tapias, made such inflammatory statements in testimony given to the United States Congress; in  support of his sentiments, General Fernandez  Tapias testified to facts and circumstances concerning the arrest and judicial process in this case  which in the course of the trial have been demonstrated to be false.  The Fianna Fail MEP pointed out  prejudicial  statements have been made by the current  President of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, and his  predecessor, Andres Pastrana, and by the current  Vice President Santos.   Vice President Santos's statement was made  a few weeks after he acknowledged to an earlier  observer delegation that it was improper for political representatives to make public statements prejudging the defendants as guilty.   There is no question that these statements by  political and military officers have been issued for  no other purpose than to  pressure the court   and to prejudice   the defendants'  right to a fair   trial. Like.  General   Fernandez  Ta p i a s ' s  statement,  these other  state  ments  are manifestly  inconsistent with the evidence  adduced at trial.   A team of international observers comprising  politicians, lawyers and human rights activists  have traveled from three continents to observe the  trial.  Also on the international delegation observing the trial are Sinn Fein TD Sean Crowe, Fianna  Fail Senator Mary White, Australian MP Paul  Lynch, Australian human rights  lawyer Shann  Kerrigan, Australian trade unionist  Brett   Gay,   US   Brehon   Law  Society     president      Steve   /  McCabc, US human rights  activist Pat  Fowler,   USJ   human   rights   lawyer   Natalie  Kabasakalian,  Irish lawyers Pat Daly  and Ronan Munro and  Irish trade unionist Des   Former political prisoners have  always played a central role in Irish  Republican politics. Today many of the  political leaders within Sinn Fein are former political prisoners, the role of prisoners and former prisoners was recognized as crucial to the development of  the peace process within the community  St local level.  An organisation called (loiste na n-  larchiml was established. Its primary  aim was to help former prisoners reintegrate into society and to enable them to  use their abilities to shape the new society that will emerge from the Irish Peace  Process.  In 1999/2000 I was granted a position within Coiste, It was a full-time paid  position. I was the director of a new sub-  unit in Dublin called Tar Isteach. My job,  indeed the project, was funded by the   fish government as pail of the peace  process. Similar projects were and are  funded by the British government in the  north of Ireland.  Many of the discussions thai we had  liming llie course of our work in Coiste  identified the need for social justice and  how thai could be achieved. We recognized the need lo study other situations  and see how conflict resolution processes were developing. To do that wc knew  that it was necessary to meet face to face  with others in different countries who  were engaged in broadly similar processes.  Declaration of Jim Monaghan  Witnesses have already explained  in detail the problems facing former prisoners including travel restrictions. With  these problems come dangers. Because  of these and previous experiences in  travel shared by each of us we felt it  wiser and safer to travel by legitimate  means but using a different identity.  I came to know Martin McCauley  through the ex-prisoner community, our  friendship developed when Martin and  his family were forced to move near  Dublin following threats to their lives. I  have known Niall Connolly for a number  of years. He is a native of Dublin and  returns there on his regular trips home  from Latin America. 1 knew Niall  worked on humanitarian projects in that  region. The three of us share the same  broad political interests. Niall and I traveled to Nicaragua together a few years  ago.  In the summer of 2001 the three of  us traveled to Colombia principally to  see the peace process but also to enjoy a  holiday. For reasons already stated the  three of us traveled with different names.  We traveled openly and the way all other  travelers would. Wc visited the peace  /one.  We spent several weeks in the zone.  We talked to a great many people. We  shared  experiences   about  the  peace  processes in Ireland and Colombia.  We discussed the involvement of  outsiders in such processes. From an  Irish perspective the advice and experiences of people involved in South  Africa, Palestine, East Timor and other  regions in Latin America were very  important.  We discussed the process of becoming involved in a political system seen as  hostile and the gains and the problems  that resulted from such a course of  action. We talked at length about the role  of former prisoners in political developments in Ireland and the Irish peace  process.  We met with members of the  FARC. We learnt from them about the  great number of visitors and political  representatives who had visited the zone.  This included members of the  Colombian government and many people from outside Colombia.  Since wc were arrested at El  Dorado airport there has been a constant  flow of misinformation and false allegations against us. The Embassies of the  United States and Britain have both  intervened to distort the truth. We were  then driven to a military barracks where  North American officials were present.  After this we were brought to the  Prosecutor's office. Everything was hap  pening very fast, there were a lot of soldiers about. We denied meeting the  FARC initially because we thought it  would make matters worse for us.  The US forensics has been exposed  as bogus. The stories of satellite pictures, videotapes and so on have been  proven to be false. The British Embassy  alleged that I am a member of the IRA. It  is illegal in Ireland, North and South, and  in England to belong to the IRA. I have  lived openly, and traveled to all parts of  Ireland over the past 17 years. I have not  been arrested or charged in relation to  any of these allegations, I reject them. I  am not a member of the IRA.  False evidence has been presented  to this court. This is clear in the case of  the US Embassy. The British Embassy  also presented as factual evidence what  amounts to no more than wild claims.  Witnesses produced by the Colombian  military have been proven to have given  false testimony.  The charge of training the FARC is  a false charge, based on false evidence.  The training never happened, and my  friends and I are therefore not guilty.  I would like to conclude by thanking my family and friends who have supported me in every way since my arrest.  The work carried out on our behalf by  everyone involved in the  Bring Them  Home  Campaign has given us strength  Thank you all.  Following the signing of the Good  Friday Agreement and the International  Commission headed by Chris Patten, a  former British government minister and  former British Governor of Hong Kong,  was established to make recommendations for the creation of a new police  service that would be acceptable to all  sections of the community. I gave evidence to this Commission based on my  own experiences at the hands of the  RUC. As a result of my court case and  the publicity it received I was subjected  to a campaign of vicious harassment by  the RUC and the British military. A bomb  was placed at my home. At that time I  was legally represented by Rosemary  Nelson, a human rights lawyer.  Rosemary was threatened by the RUC. In  1999 the same death squads that had  killed Pat Finucane, killed Rosemary  Nelson.  I was in genuine fear for the safety  of my family and myself. I moved from  the North of Ireland, which is under  British occupation and went to live in the  south.  Prior to moving south, I had been  involved with former political prisoners  in Lurgan, Co. Armagh. When I had settled into my new home I became rein-  volved with work for former prisoners. I  re-established contact with Jim  Monaghan who I had met previously.  Through this work I became involved in  discussions and debates on conflict and  Declaration of  Martin McCauley  conflict resolution.  I met Niall Connolly through Jim,  following a discussion on Latin America.  When the idea of the trip to Colombia  arose I agreed to travel with Jim and  Niall. I had never been to Latin America,  and I was interested in visiting this continent and seeing their peace process.  I have lived openly, north and south  for 20 years. I have been in regular  employment. Part of my employment  involved me adapting motor vehicles for  use by people with disabilities. I have  traveled openly all over Ireland. I have  not been charged with any of the offences  alleged by the RUC or the British  Embassy. I am not a member of the IRA.  I am not guilty of the charges laid out  against me in this court.  Like my two friends I was using  another name. Each of us had experience  of threats, harassment and violence in  shared and different situations. There is  nothing more than a desire to travel  unhindered in the fact that I was traveling  on another name. I have explained how  my life and those of my family have been  threatened. 1 have explained how two  human rights lawyers who have worked  on my behalf  Pat Finucane and  Rosemary Nelson    were murdered by  pro-British death squads.  I am a supporter of Irish republicanism. I have worked within my community to help give a political voice to their  views. I am not a member of Sinn Fein. I  have worked for Sinn Fein candidates in  elections. I believe in the right of the Irish  people to control their destiny free from  foreign occupation and interference.  The peace process in Ireland continues to survive but it has been undermined  and attacked by elements within the  British political and military establishment and from pro-British forces in  Ireland. Our arrest in Colombia has been  used by these and other elements to further undermine the peace process.  Elements in the Colombian military and  the political establishment have fed lies  and misinformation to the media to serve  their own interests. The Embassy of the  United States cannot escape criticism for  its role in this affair. Their so-called  forensic evidence against us is fraudulent  and misleading.  I wish to directly refute the evidence  given by Captain Pulido. At no stage did  I speak with this man. At the airport I was  not asked for my passport nor was I asked  my name at the time of my arrest.  Captain Pulido's testimony is wrong.  In conclusion, I wish to thank my  family and friends, the legal and political  observers who have traveled great distances to help us, and everyone involved  in the Bring Them Home campaign.  Bonass.  On Tuesday morning, the international delegation of observers visited the three men in La  Modela jail in Bogota: :. The delegation had a  meeting with the Director and Deputy director of  the jail and raised concerns with them about the  men's security.  Caitriona Ruane said it was a very useful  meeting.  We infonned thcin that we feel that  there is no safe jail in Colombia for these three  men given the high profile nature of this case,  she  said.     We   also  expressed concern     about  their seen-  rity on route to the court.   The observers were  infonned at  the meeting that a few hours prior to their visit,  three pistols, three grenades, 162 rounds of ammunition and ten mobile phones were found.   Niall Connolly rang me at 6.30pm and  infonned me that an inmate had been stabbed this  afternoon on one of the wings,  said Ruane.  It was during their visit that the TV news  reported General Mora made his prejudicial comments, calling for the conviction of the three  accused.  This is absolutely disgraceful. Where is  the presumption of innocence of these three men?   asked Ruane.  It is impossible for them to get a  fair trial. The reason he is making these comments  is to pressurize the judge.   She said the delegation was requesting an  urgent meeting with Colombian President Uribe.  Andrews pledged as a member of the  European Parliament to bring the events of the  trial to the attention of the European Parliament.  In addition, he said he would be bringing up the  matter by way of resolution to the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the European Parliament at the earliest opportunity. He said he would be raising the  issue with the Italian presidency.  In view of the  fact that Ireland will hold the presidency beginning 1 January 2004, we will collectively as a  group be seeking a meeting with the Irish  Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Cowen,  he  said.  Closing defense arguments will mark the end  of the trial this week, but it is expected to be some  weeks before a verdict is delivered.

I  was  motivated by  my  Declaration  ofNiall  Connolly  English to good use. I worked as a  translator.  On occasion,  as the  court has heard in evidence, I was  employed as a guide for visiting  politicians and media.  I became active in political  mobilization against the British  political and military occupation  of part of Ireland in the 1980s. In  particular, I was influenced by the  hunger strike in  1981 when ten  Irish prisoners died in a British  prison.   I  participated  in  campaigns and protests during this  period.   I support Sinn Fein and  wherever  I   was,   at   home   or  abroad, I made myself available  to promote the aims of Sinn F6in.  I am a supporter of the Irish peace  process and the efforts of leaders  like  Gerry Adams and Martin  McGuinness who arc striving to  bring about a lasting peace with  social justice.  I  visited  Ireland  regularly.  During one of my visits home I  got to know Jim Monaghan. Jim  was aware of my work in Latin  America and was eager to hear  my experiences.
