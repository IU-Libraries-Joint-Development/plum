Exactly what was the bureaucratic or  political decision process in operation at  INS and within the Bush administration  that lead to John McNicholl's arrest: a  dedicated, loving family man with a wife  and three children who are American citizens; a twenty year resident of  Philadelphia and a taxpaying, union pipe  fitter; a solid, law-abiding citizen and  active in the Irish American community -  John was a past president of  Philadelphia's Derry Society.  Was the decision fair? Was it implemented in a judicious manner? Was the  physical arrest and speed with which the  deportation took place cruel and unusual?  Are Irish people from the north who participated in the conflict on the republican  side being targeted for deportation despite  the GFA? Exactly who or what office  made this decision?  The final question is a broader one. Is  America a safer place today as a result of  having John McNicholl ripped from his  home and deported; and his wife and his  three children forced to leave this county?  We can speculate about the answers to  the first group of questions. My belief is  that, from the surface of the facts that we  have, the nature of the decision to deport  Mr. McNicholl was unfair and prejudiced;  and the nature of the physical event of his  deportation was cruel and unusual.  But I know for sure, and so do all  those that know the McNicholl family or  families like the McNicholls, that America  is a weaker, sadder country without them.  I also fear for all of our freedoms and for  the course of justice if this is indicative of  a new America.  These are the facts:  1  John McNicholl was  arrested  by  the Immigration and Naturalization  Service at 5:30 a.m., July 17, as he left his  Philadelphia home for work. Sean, his 18-  year-old son who witnessed the event, said  his father was  kidnapped by strange men  ...and bundled into an unmarked car.  The  young man ran after the car in vain. The  younger children suffer nightmares of  being kidnapped and taken away. Mr.  McNicholl was deported in shackles the  next day after being allowed 30 minutes  with his wife Frankie.  2  John McNicholl was charged with  killing an RUC man, but escaped from  Long Kesh while awaiting trial by a jury-  less, special military-style court. He and  Frankie came to the US in 1984 and  immediately went to work making a life  and raising a family.  3  Mr. McNicholl was charged by  immigration officials of entering this  country illegally and lying concerning his  arrest on his visa application.  A Bureau of Immigration and  Customs enforcement officer said that Mr.  McNicholl  went through the whole  process and was denied his last appeal.   The Board of Appeals issued a deportation  order on 10 July and it was enforced on 17  July, the day the stunned family lawyer,  James Orlow, had filled an appeal on the  first decision.  4  The US Department of Homeland  Security Bureau of Immigration and  Customs Enforcement stated on 21 July  that Mr. McNicholl was  a suspected  member of the INLA, a terrorist organization in Ireland.   If this is the cause for the deportation,  it is a curious one. The INLA has not been  on the US State Department's Terrorist  Organization list since they went on  ceasefire  in   1998  after the  GFA was                                111  signed. Who or what made the decision to  take action against groups not on the State  Department list? Why?  6  The Irish platform that President  Bush ran under states,  In the spirit of that  healing document  the GFA  we call for a  review of issues of deportation and extradition arising prior to the accord.   The offenses that Mr. McNicholl was  accused, but never convicted of, took  place almost thirty years ago in the 1970s.  What is going on here?  Have your senators and members of  congress find out exactly what the administration, the INS, the Department of  Homeland Security is up to. They and we  need to have answers and then we need  justice, not only for the McNicholls, but  also for those that will surely follow.  Concern for new US/UK Extradition  Treaty  We are also distressed by the implications of the proposed, new US/UK  Supplemental Extradition Treaty. This  treaty must not be pushed or bullied  through without thorough debate. Ask  your Senators to put a hold on this treaty  until it can be fully assessed.  All senators can be accessed through  the congressional switchboard 202-225-  3121.  The three Irishmen on trial in  Colombia made a surprise appearance in  court for the first time in their trial on  Wednesday as the lengthy proceedings  draw to a close.  They vehemently protested their innocence of training FARC guerillas, reasserting their position that they had been in  Colombia, like many other international  visitors, to observe the peace process. The  men singled out the British and US  embassies in Bogota for special criticism,  accusing them of spreading misinformation  about them from the outset.  The previous day, the head of  Colombia's armed forces, in what the men's  supporters believe is part of an ongoing  campaign by Colombia's political and mili-  We're innocent  Colombia accused testify in court  tary establishment to put  pressure on the  trial judge,  publicly called  for their conviction.  N i a 1 1  Connolly,  Martin  McCauley and Jim Monaghan have been  charged with the use of false public documentation and training the FARC. They  have been in custody for nearly two years.  5**  The trial began  on 4 October  last and since  it began it has  stopped and  started seven  times.  Following  the summing  up by the prosecution on Monday, each of the men made  statements to the court on Wednesday. The  defense will begin its summation on  Thursday.  Caitriona Ruane of the Bring Them  Home Campaign said:  Niall Connolly,  Martin McCauley and Jim Monaghan have  taken the opportunity to give their version  of events and come to the court. We are  calling on the Colombian government to  rein in their military now and to stop their  attempts to intimidate the judge. There is no  evidence in this case, the military know it,  the prosecutor knows it, the Colombian  government knows it and the world knows  it.   The Colombian authorities should  send these men home to their families. The  Irish government should be calling for the  release of the men. This is a farcical show  trial.
