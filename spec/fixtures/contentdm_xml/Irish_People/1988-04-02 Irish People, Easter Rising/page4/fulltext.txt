EXECUTION  British Style  kiiiiuiiiinuin .urn C nun. a ni  1916  SPONSORED BY  Mary Wilson, Irish People  Mairead Farrell  1988  SPONSORED BY  COUNTY LEITRIM SOCIETY  Sean Mac Diarmada  Sean MacDermott  Sean Mac Diarmada (1886-1916) was born in  Kiltyclogher, County Leitrim. He emigrated to Glasgow at  the age of fifteen years. Returning to Belfast after a few  years, he was sworn into the IRB in 1908, and  transferred to Dublin, wh,ere he became a very close  personal friend of Tomas O Cleirigh. He was appointed  fulltime organizer for the IRB and Sinn Fein. In this  capacity he traveled extensively throughout the country. In 1912 he contracted polio and thereafter walked  only with the aid of a stick. He was a founder member of  the Irish Volunteers in 1913, and later became a member of the Military council and provisional government.  He fought in the General Post Office and was executed  in Kilmainham Jail on May 12th.  Like Sean Mac Diarmada, Leitrim native Brian (Barney) McKeon, has been subjected to British injustice in  the form of imprisonment. Convicted on a charge of  conspiracy, Barney originally faced nine charges ranging from conspiracy to gun running. It took three trials  (with Barney forced to function as his own attorney in  the final one) to put Barney behind bars on one flimsy  charge. Barney is back home again with the loyal family  who were unflinching in their support Barney McKeon, all  of Leitrim salutes you and your fine family
