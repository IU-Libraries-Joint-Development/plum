Sean Meehan Re-Arrested  Outside Portlaiose Jail  Justice McGrath at Portarlington  court granted an application for the  extradition of Sean Meehan (22), of  Crumlin Road, Belfast.  The Justice informed Meehan that  the warrant would not be issued for  15 days. In the meantime, Meehan  was granted bail in his own surety of    1,000 and one surety from William  Fuller, Howth Road, Dublin, of    5,000.  Meehan is wanted in Belfast in  connection with the murder of  Constable Raymond Carroll on  January 28, 1972. It is understood  that three other men are already  serving sentences in connection with  the same charge.  Det.-Sgt. Philip O'Keeffe,  Portlaoise, told  the  court  that  he  arrested Meehan on foot of a warrant  outside Portlaoise Jail on Saturday  morning last. When charged later at a  special court, Meehan replied:   Nothing to say.   Witness told Mr. Myles Shevlin,  solicitor, defending, that he could not  actually identify Meehan as the man  wanted in Belfast.  Det.-Constable Bert Elliott, R.U.C,  Belfast, said he identified Meehan as  the man wanted in connection with  the murder.  Mr. Myles Shevlin submitted that  the warrant as issued was not good. It  did not name any discernable person.  It mentioned a police constable only.  There could be any number of  constables.  London Catholic Institute's  Evidence Slams Internment  The London-based Catholic  Institute for International Relations,  whose President is Cardinal Heenan,  has come out strongly against  internment.  The Institute's criticisms are  contained in a 2,000 word  memorandum it has submitted to the  Gardiner Committee which is  currently looking into the workings  of the Northern Ireland Emergency  Provisions Act. Members of the  Institute also gave evidence to the  Committee in Belfast last week.  The CHR evidence calls for a date  to be set when all internees must  either be released or formally charged  with a specific offence before the  Northern Ireland courts. This, the  evidence says,  is the only feasible  policy... and there is no room for  half measures.   Opposition to internment, the  memorandum says, derives among  both the Catholic and Protestant  communities in the North from the  basic injustice of the system.  The document attacks specifically  the workings of the Emergency  Provisions Act, its  derogation from  accepted British standards of justice   and the demoralising effect of  internment on individuals, families  and the community in Northern  Ireland.   There is no doubt,  the evidence  says,  that the introduction in August  1971 of internment without trial  greatly accelerated the trend towards  violence and alienated almost the  entire Catholic community.   The CUR urges the need  to  restore respect for the rule of law  in  the North, but adds that there can be  no hope of introducing any civil  police force into many areas while  internment lasts.  The authors of the CUR evidence  acknowledge the help of among  others the Rev. Enda McDonagh,  Professor of Moral Theology at  Maynooth, Fr. Desmond Wilson of  Belfast and Professor Hywell Griffiths  of the New University of Ulster, in  preparing their memorandum.  BBC Sit-In By Loyalist Women  Programmes by BBC Northern  Ireland were not disrupted last week  despite a sit-in by up to 100 relatives  and friends of loyalist prisoners at  Long Kesh who were demanding  better conditions for their men. They  refused to allow staff in or out and  threatened to call in UDA men unless  they were allowed to continue their  protest peacefully.  The women sat in the lobby of the  Ormeau Avenue studios and some  wandered around talking to staff but  the general tone of the occupation  was good-humoured.  Northern Ireland head of  programmes, Mr. Richard Francis,  said that while he could not condone  an invasion of private property in this  manner, the protest had not  , interfered with the preparation or  transmission of programmes.  The occupation began shortly after  10 a.m. when about 30 women, led  by Mrs. Mary Douglas, burst through  the doors past the security men. They  were later joined by other women  who were coming back from visits to  Long Kesh. Cigarettes and food were  banded in through windows and  loyalist flags were flown to highlight  their protest.  We decided to occupy  the BBC to get the maximum  publicity for our protest against the  inhuman conditions being suffered by  our men in Long Kesh, even though  they had nothing to do with the  burning of the camp by the  republicans,  said one of the women.  During the day they allowed  members of the BBC Northern  Ireland Orchestra to leave after a  rehearsal, but movement in and out  of Broadcasting House was severely  restricted and at the whim of the  protesters. The women were later  joined by loyalist councillor, Mr.  Hugh Smith.  Persecution And Principle  It is with reluctance we refer to the part played by the  Irish Hierarchy in the tragic happenings of 1922-23, but  history is history and the truth, however bitter, must be  told. We wish with all our heart that the story could have  been otherwise, that we could tell with pride of spiritual  guides who were at one with the most loyal and devoted of  their flock in their desire and their efforts for freedom, as  Cardinal Mercier and the Bishops and priests of Belgium  were with their people when the horrors of invasion and  war swept down on them in 1914. Instead of hailing the  invader as the legitimate ruler of Belgium and his native  tools as patriots, Cardinal Mercier encouraged his people to  the utmost resistance they could give and lashed with  words of fire those slavish Belgians who yielded to the  invader, co-operated with him in any way or recognised  him as having the slightest authority or right in Belgium  then or in the future. The noble words with which he  inspired his own countrymen gave inspiration to the men  of 1916, of 1920 and of 1922 in Ireland, when they stood  up against the arrogant attacks of England and of  England's Irish tools and gave their clean lives for the  God-given freedom and honour of Ireland.   I was asked lately by a staff officer/' said Cardinal  Mercier,  whether a soldier falling in a righteous  cause-and our cause is such a demonstration-is not  veritably a martyr. Well, he is not a martyr in the rigorous  theological meaning of the word, inasmuch as he dies in  arms, whereas the martyr delivers himself, undefended and  unarmed, into the hands of the executioner. But if I am  asked what I think of the eternal salvation of a brave man  who has consciously given his life in defence of his  country's honour, and in vindication of violated justice, I  shall not hesitate to reply, without any doubt whatever,  Christ crowns his military valour, and that death, accepted  in this Christian spirit, assures the safety of that man's  soul.  Greater love than this no man hath,' said Our  Saviour, 'that a man lay down his life for his friends.' And  the soldier who dies to save his brothers and to defend the  hearths and altars of his country, reaches this highest of all  degrees of Charity.   When the soldiers of the Republic of Ireland were  fighting 'to defend the hearths and altars of their country'  against England's Black-and-Tans they were excom  municated by at least one Irish Bishop and denounced by  several others. When 93 per cent of the people declared by  their votes that Dail Eireann and the I.R.A. were the  lawful Government and Army of Ireland   the most unanimous vote that has ever been given in the face of armed  intimidation in any country on earth-the Irish Hierarchy  were respectfully asked to crown their people's choice by  giving their allegiance to Dail Eireann and so stregthen the  hands of those who were trying to make real and lasting  peace with England. They refused, and by their refusal  forfeited their right to take part in the political affairs of  their country in the future. But when the Treaty of  Surrender was signed and its terms prematurely published  by the English and their Irish allies, and before the elected  representatives of the people had time to meet and discuss  what had been done without authority, some of the  Bishops rushed into print to urge its acceptance and  commenced privately to urge deputies of Dail Eireann to  vote for it. They went further. They entered into the  strangest Alliance that has ever been known in Ireland. The  Fenians, or Irish Republican Brotherhood, a great end  splendid military organisation, founded in 1858, became  such a menance to British Imperialism that a clever and  subtle campaign of English lying and misrepresentation  succeeded in having it condemned by Rome as a secret  society on the lines of the Freemasons or the  Oddfellows-which it was not. From the Sixties down to  our own day the I.R.B. was condemned year by year in  Lenten Pastorals and the young men warned against it. The  I.R.B., re-organised and made a very compact, effective  organisation by Clarke, MacDiarmada, Pearse and MacBride was the spark that lit the Easter Fire of 1916.  Afterwards, when the I.R.A. gave allegiance to Dail  Eireann, an effort was made by Cathal Brugha and others  to have the I.R.B. disbanded, as there was no further  necessity for and a great deal of danger in a secret  organisation; but Michael Collins and his friends kept it in  being and, after the truce, tried to get into it every  member of the I.R.A., the reason given being  to safeguard  the Republic as there was danger of the politicians letting  it down.  It was the I.R.B. prostituted to political ends,  that undermined the loyalty of high Army officers and  soldier deputies of Dail Eireann in December, 1921, and it  was an alliance or comgination of the Irish Hierarchy and  the I.R.B. that carried the Treaty of Surrender. There is no  doubt whatever about that.  When the Provisional Government was set up by men  who had publicly stated that they would be loyal to their  solemn oath and would keep intact the Republic of  Ireland, the Bishops smiled on it and frowned on its  opponents. In October, 1922, after war had been started  by the usurpers, under orders from England, after the Pact  of Peace had been broken by them, and after they had  already murdered Republicans, The Bishops issued what  they called a  Joint Pastoral  in which they gave their  whole-hearted support to those who had betrayed their  trust and murdered their kin, and they forbade their  priests to give Absolution to the defenders of the Republic  or to any of their supporters, all of whom were denounced  in most intemperate language. There was condemnation in  the  Joint Pastoral  of what were called  unauthorised  murders,  but when the implication of those ill-chosen  words was seen, they were repudiated by their authors.  But it was too late. Such thoroughly British organs as The  Freeman's Journal, and The Tablet (London) had already  published the version containing the extraordinary words,  and their copies of the Pastoral had been handed to them  by the Secretary to the Hierarchy, himself a Bishop. After  that, no penitent known to be a Republican who had not  turned traitor to Ireland, was given Absolution unless he  answered in the affirmative the question;  Do you accept  the Joint Pastoral?  Prisoners were in a terrible position.  There were over 10,000 men and women, boys and girls, in  the British jails and internment camps of the 26 Counties.  They had been arrested and held without charge of any  kind-simply because they were Republicans-and the bare  fact that they were prisoners put upon them the ban of the  Bishops. The chaplains could not give them the Sacraments  unless they accepted the Pastoral, they could not accept  the Pastoral without accepting as truth the falsehood that  the Provisional Government of usurpers and rebels was a  Government elected by the votes of the people, without  accepting treachery and murder as virtues and fidelity and  sacrifice as crimes, and so men and women the mcst  devoted and loyal to their Faith in Ireland were left  without the strength and consolation of Confession and  Holy Communion.  Superiors of Religious Orders were reprimanded by  individual Bishops for sending confessors to Columns of  Republican soldiers in the hills.' Republican priests or nuns  could not express their opinions, even in the privacy of  communities, while those who supported the  Free  Stater,  even in battle, was murder. The I.R.B. was  honoured; those who had tried to have that secret society  disbanded and to have only open organisations were  treated as men accursed. Michael Collins was the leading  man in the I.R.B. When he was killed in battle, he was  given honours scarcely less than would have been given to  a Cardinal. There was no protest when a prominent I.R.B.  man stood up in the midst of Bishops and priests and  likened Michael Collins to Our Lord walking on the waters  of the Lake of Galilee. And only a little while before the  dead body of Cathal Brugha-one of the most exemplary  Catholics in Ireland-was refused admission to a Dublin  Church. It was said at the time that the slaughter of the  Four Martyrs on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception  in 1922 was delayed for over an hour in the hope that they  would accept the  Joint Pastoral  as just, and the  Government of traitors as the lawful authority. For that  official murder of innocent men no word of condemnation  came from the Bishops. Over two hundred  authorised   and  unauthorised murders  were committed by the  renegades in power, but they were hailed by the Bishops as  the saviours of their country, while their clean-hearted  victims who died the death of martyrs were denounced as  robbers, looters and hooligans who were not worthy of  Christian burial. Priests who came out into the open as  Republicans were victimised. Some were driven into exile,  like Father Albert, Father Dominic, Father Joseph and  Father Ciaran, while others who could not stand by and  see the injustice of it all and the danger to the Faith which  it threatened, had to express themselves anonymously and  do good by stealth. Their candid opinions of the  Joint  Pastoral., and the attitude it represented could be quoted  here, but they would be of little use because no names  could be appended to them.  Three RTE Chiefs May Face  Charges Of Publicising IRA  Three leading RTE programme  makers could soon face charges of  breaking a Government directive  banning all TV publicity for the IRA.  In a new move, the RTE Authority  is to decide shortly whether or not  the controversial  7-Days   programme on internment-screened  nearly three weeks ago-breached the  Section 31 guidelines laid down more  than two years ago.  The RTE Board has now taken a  direct interest in the programme  which drew a personal protest from  the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs,  and its nine members have demanded  a full file on the show which led to  management action inside the station.  Transferred producer Eoghan  Harris and his editor, Gerry Murray,  hit by the results of an inquiry into  the programme, appealed the  management moves during a  four-hour hearing on Saturday but  now both men and their direct  superior, Current Affairs Chief, Des  Fisher, may have to face the  Authority directly to explain the  show.  The results of the appeal heard by  Authority member, Mr. Sean  MacReamoinn; Personnel Head,  Oliver Maloney, and Assistant  Programme Controller, Mr. Jack  White, are expected to be made  known today but the appeal decision  Hunger Strike At  Crumlin Rd. Jail  Republican remand prisoners in  Crumlin Road Jail-some of whom  have been waiting for trial for up to a  year-a hunger strike began November  7 in protest against being locked up in  their cells for 22 out of every 24  hours.  The strike was undertaken initially  by 30 prisoners, and more will join in  the next few days until all 165 men in  a wing are involved.  During the strike the men are  understood to intend refusing food  parcels.  Sentenced prisoners are expected  to refuse to leave their cells in  support of their demands for a return  to normality at the prison.  The latest trouble at the prison has  its origins in the burning of Long  Kesh three weeks ago.  Prisoners at Crumlin Road  demonstrated in support and the  remand prisoners feel that they have  been excessively penalised since then.  The remand prisoners-who are  innocent until proven guilty in the  court-are normally allowed  . considerable access to recreation  facilities and free association with  each other.  But up to now, recreation breaks  were being confined to two hours per  day for three batches of 55 men each,  and they claim that the Governor of  the prison told them that this  situation would continue indefinitely.   The men find this situation  intolerable and are determined to  highlight their grievances, particularly  since there has been absolutely no  trouble for the past three weeks.  may be held in abeyance until the  Authority has finished its look at the  show.  If the Board decides that the  programme breached the Section 31  directive, Mr. Harris, Mr. Murray and  Mr. Fisher could face more serious  charges.  The Authority is understood to be  intent on discharging its obligations  under the directive and its members  are not prepared to risk the  possibility of being sacked, the fate  which met the station Authority  when it failed to reach a decision over  a radio interview with Sean  MacStiophain two years ago.  RTE Administrators are also  becoming worried about new  consumer programmes, according to a  document submitted by the station to  the Common Market Commission and  published in the current edition of  the EEC  Industry and Society.   The latest dispute within RTE over  the showing of a  7-Days   programme on internment is certain  to be raised in the Dail later this  week, Chris Glennon writes.  Two questions to the Minister, Dr.  Cruise O'Brien, will provide a vehicle  for examining his role in relation to  RTE programmes, particularly the  October 17 film on internment.  Mr. Tom Meaney, F.F. deputy,  mid-Cork, will ask the Minister the  number of occasions on which he has  requested time on radio or TV to  explain his viewpoint and how many  times the Minister has  verbally or in  writing contacted the RTE authorities  to communicate his displeasure with  certain programmes.   Those questions are not expected  to be reached until later. The  Taoiseach will be asked by Mr. Sean  Moore (F.F.) if there are any  proposals before the Government to  amend the Constitution or to prepare  a new Constitution.     Torture On Trial  Four Northern Ireland men who  were tortured at the hands of the  British Army and the R.U.C. Special  Branch left Dublin Airport this week  accompanied by their lawyers to  attend the  Torture  case against the  British Government at the European  Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  The case will continue until next  Thursday and a team of four doctors  as well as Mr. John Hume of the  S.D.L.P. and delegates from the  Republic are attending. However,  three of the seven men are in Long  Kesh and last minute efforts by their  lawyers, and an appeal by them to the  European Commission, failed to  secure their release for the Court  hearings.  The British Government has  insisted that they will not be released  and has refused the Commissioners  access to Long Kesh to take  statements from the three. Two of  the men have been interned for  almost a year and the other is a  sentenced prisoner, but friends have  requested that their names be  withheld for the present because of  fears for the safety of other members  of their families.
