'I Was Not  Ward's  Boyfriend  The mystery surrounding the  private life of convicted mass  murderer, Judith Ward, has led to  many speculative stories about her  friends and contacts during her stay  in Ireland.  Her claim that she married Michael  McVerry, the formerProvisional IRA  0/C in South Armagh, has already  been denied by McVerry's parents  and the records at the Irish Register  Office.  And last night, a story that her real  boy friends in the Provisional  movement was Long Kesh internee  Eugene Moore was vehemently denied  by him.  Mr. Moore, now living with his wife  and child in Dundalk, insisted that he  had never met Judith Ward and was at  no time a member of the Provos.  A butcher in a Dundalk  supermarket, Mr. Moore (34) was  interned during the 1956-62 IRA  campaign and was again  lifted   during the big roundup on August 9,  1971, and Interned in Long Kesh. He  was released in April, 1972.  During Judith Ward's trial at  Wakefield Court it was stated that she  had visited him in Long Kesh. But last  night he said he had never met  anybody fitting her description.   This has left me in a terrible  predicament. I am in no way in  sympathy with what she has done,   added Mr. Moore, who said he had  not been actively involved with the  IRA since 1969.  The dealership of  both wings will confirm that,  he  added.  Since the trial began his house has  been besieged by English reporters.  'They said their sources in the British  Special Branch told them I was  connected with Judith Ward. I don't  know where they got their  information.   I have asked numerous friends in  Dundalk and Newry about Miss Ward  but nobody knows anything about  her,  said Mr. Moore.  The Moore family used to make  regular visits to his mother and father  in Newry but now these have  stopped.   With these stories flying around  there is every possibility that I will be  lifted again by the British and thrown  into Long Kesh. Twice is enough,  he  added.  Mr. Justice Waller, the judge in the  Judith Ward case, was surrounded by  a tight security screen yesterday after  he had sentenced her at Wakefield  Crown Court.  Ward is expected to start her  30-year jail sentence in a secure part  of a men's prison. But when the  conversion of E Wing at Durham jail  as a women's prison is completed she  is likely to join Myra Hindley, the  Moors murderer, and other women  required to be kept in top security  conditions.  And former Chief of Staff of the  Provisional IRA, Mr. Sean Mac  Stiofain yesterday denied ever having  met Judith Ward, as claimed by her  brother, David, yesterday.  Her brother David had claimed that  while he and Miss Ward were living in  Sandymount, Dublin,  one of her  many visitors was Sean Mac Stiofain.  Last night Mr. Mac Stiofain said:  I  deny categorically having ever met  Miss Judith Ward, much less visited  her in a flat in Sandymount. If my  information is correct, she and her  brother lived in this flat around the  time I was incarcerated in the Curragh  Camp.   Broken Pipe Led To  Huge Dock Inferno  A fractured pipeline to a  roadtanker caused the gas leak which  lead to the huge blaze at the  Calor-Kosangas gas-bottling depot at  Dublin's North Wall early yesterday.  But forensic examination have still  failed to discover where the spark  came from to ignite the fire, the city's  worst in many years.  One theory being investigated was  that the blaze was caused by a hot  point on the exhaust pipe of the  tanker being filled. The ignition had  been switched off before loading  began.  Night workmen had turned off all  electrical equipment, shut off gas  valves and set the sprinkler system in  operation before leaving the premises.  The gas depot is quite close to  major oil stores, and firemen  prevented the blaze from spreading  and igniting three containers in the  yard, of each containing 400 tons of  gas.  Sinn Fein  Demands  End To  British Rule  Mr. Ruairi O'Bradaigh, President of  Sinn Fein (Kevin Street) issued the  following statement on November  6th condemning the death of Hugh  Cooney of Coalisland, Co. Tyrone.  The murder of Hugh Gerard  Coney, (age 24), Coalisland, Co.  Tyrone, by British troops at Long  Kesh Internment Camp, and the  further brutalizing of unarmed  prisoners by these same troops for the  second time in three weeks, adds a  further chapter to the infamy of  internment without trial in Ireland.  Mr. Rees and his government have  shown in words and deeds that their  concern for their guard dogs is greater  than that for the human beings who  fill their concentration camps,  irrespective of whether they are  Republicans or  Loyalists ,  sentenced prisoners or internees.  It is time to call not just for an end  to the abomination which is Long  Kesh but also for the final closing  down of that British rule which  requires internment in every decade  to maintain itself.  No British Military Inquiry or  other investigation short of a full  International Inquiry into Long Kesh  will have the slightest credence with  the Irish people.  Sincere sympathy is offered to the  relatives, comrades and friends of the  dead internee on behalf of the entire  Republican Movement.  Recital November 24  NEW YORK, N.Y.-Ray DeVoll,  tenor soloist with the NEW YORK  PRO MUSICA, Baltimore Symphony,  Rochester Symphony, and countless  other orchestras and opera  companies, will present an evening of  Renaissance, Elizabethan, Baroque,  and Romantic songs at Alice Tully  Hall on Sunday, November 24 at 8:00  P.M. Mr. DeVoll will be assisted by  pianist Allen Rogers and lutenist  Lucy Cross.  The program is drawn from the  wide background of Ray DeVoll's  unusual repertoire and ranges from  the works of Italian Renaissance  composers Peri and Mazzaferrata to,  the lovely Elizabethan lute songs of  Dowland, Ford, andBartlettjo songs  Continued on Page 13  But there was a series of explosions  from small cylinders as they were  hurled hundreds of feet into the night  sky, lit by a ball of blue and yellow  flames. Two people were injured.  One of them, Mr. Martin Olwell, a  fireman attacked to Tara Street  station, was discharged after  treatment. The other man, Michael  Walsh (26), an RTE technician, was  detained in the Richmond Hospital  with head injuries. He lives at Elgin  Road and is a native of Foxford, Co.  Mayo.  Company executives and Garda  forensic experts sifted through the  charred gas cylinders in the road  loading yard where the fire was  contained by up to 50 firemen. Five  road tankers were burnt out in the  blaze, a large number of small  cylinders were blown apart and a  workshop was also badly burnt.  The inferno forced more than 200  residents of Alexandra Road area to  leave their homes.

Company engineers examined the  scene to assess the cost, but no figure  has yet been put on the damage  caused. There was speculation that  the figure could run into hundreds of  thousands of pounds.  A spokesman for the company, Mr.  B. Evans, stressed that the fire was  contained to the yard area and   exaggerated fears  were due to the  confusion at the start of the fire,  many people believing bombs had  gone off in the city.   The security and fire regulations  of the port area are such that an area  where the trouble starts can be easily  isolated, as happened in this case,  he  said.  The damage was very small in  relation to the whole area.   inhuman conditions of these evil  places.  Hundreds of Irish men and women  are being held and many others are  being held under savage sentences in  the hands of these gaolers.  The fight for freedom and  sovereignty is being waged by the  wonderful men and women of this  generation. We pledge our support  and ask all concerned to join us in  this noble cause.  The struggle has been long and  arduous and the cost in human  suffering great but our goal is a free  and united Ireland.  We call on all elected officers and  all Civil Rights organizations to  express their involvement and deep  concern to the United Nations.  Failure to condemn would leave the  British free to continue the same  barbarous treatment of Irish  Republican prisoners in a savage  effort to break the spirits of the  prisoners and their loved ones.

Antrim, settled  in an American frontier  log-cabin and began  farming. Within two years  he died, and three days  after his death Andrew  was born. Mrs. Jackson  with her three children  moved in with a  neighbouring family, and  by the time he was nine  Andrew had progressed  enough at his schooling to  be selected to read the  newly-adopted Declaration  of Independence to his  assembled neighbours.  When only 14 the  future President, already a  member of the local  militia, was captured by a  British raiding party. A  British officer ordered him  to clean his boots and  when the young  Irish-American refused, he  was brutally cut across the  face with a slash of the  officer's sword. The hand  which Jackson threw up to  save himself was cut to the  bone and for the rest of  his life he carried the scars.  For the rest of his life,  too, he carried an aversion  to Britain.  The proud independence which was part of his  character as a boy  remained with Jackson as  a man. Slow to forget  either a good turn or an  injury, he did not forgive  what he considered an  intrigue against him by  Henry Clay during the  early part of his political  career. When he won the  Presidency, then, for the  second time on November  7, 1832, the fact that Clay  was his defeated opponent  made his victory all the  sweeter.  dumping, were putting off thousands  of visitors to Ireland and stopping  others from coming again.  He said that Ireland was lucky it  did not have dramatic outbreaks of  disease like other countries and said  the only solution to the problem,  which was a community one, was a  major national drive to create  awareness of the problem and combat  it.  The seminar, organised by the  Western Health Board and which was  attended by hoteliers, guesthouse  owners and caterers, was told that  little if any progress had been made in  the critical areas of hygiene.  Said    Mr.    Gorman:    'There   is  evidence to indicate that low hygiene  standards are a major barrier to the  fullest development of our tourism.  In terms of lost 'word of mouth'    business our dirt may be losing us    tens of thousands of tourists each     year.    Bord Failte is involved in hotel  hygiene in a very basic way. We claim  that all approved hotels are clean and  comfortable. By so doing we commit  ourselves to hygiene standards, not  only in those parts of the hotel seen  by the tourist, but also in the staff J  areas.   We cannot allow the visitor to be   Certainly, where Italy is  concerned, mussels often bring to  mind last year's cholera outbreak.  The price paid both in the long and  short term in tourism in cases like  these far exceeds the cost of adequate  preventative measures.   That we in Ireland have not had  such dramatic instances in no way  reflects our attitudes to hygiene. It  can be put down to a combination of  luck and a climate which does not  always provide the best conditions for  the spread of bacteria.   In those months when resorts  carry many times their normal winter  population and water runs low in the  reservoirs, we may often be on the  edge of an outbreak of major  proportions,  Mr. Gorman said.
