The  chemical, which can be used from  spray cans, is intended to cause acute  irritation to the skin, eyes, nose and  throat.  It replaces the widely-used CS gas  and has a much greater  discomfort  factor.  Officially it has never been  used on the public anywhere in the  world, but tests on rabbits in the US  show that high concentrations can  seriously damage the eyes. Some of  the results of the tests are still  classified, and the Army's move is  bound to raise demands for this  information to be published.  The Ministry of Defence said  yesterday that CR would be used in  Ulster only in certain  special  circumstances -serious riot  situations. The ministry's view has  always been that CR is no more toxic  than CS. The reason for the change is  that CS   dispelled as a gas-is  indiscriminate and the security forces  have been accused of gassing people,  sometimes in their homes, by  exploding too many canisters. CR can  be dissolved in a liquid for spraying or  in a kind of jelly to make foam riot  barriers.  The Army can dispel the new  chemical from water cannon or from  what is known as a Self-Protection  Aid Device, a small canister carried by  a soldier which works like a  water-pistol. The concentration of the  agent in these two devices is small;  one part in 2,000 (for the spray can)  and one part in 40,000 for the water  cannon. It can also be dispensed as a  gas.  Some scientists and doctors are  concerned about the possible  long-term effects of CR. The  Himsworth Committee, which  reported on the medical effects of CS  gas in 1969 and 1971, recommended  that the results of research on any  future agent should be freely available  to scientists outside government  departments. Many scientists feel that  this recommendation has not been  complied with.  The Ministry of Defence, however,  claims that it has. It says that tests  done in the US and at the Ministry's  chemical and biological warfare  centre at Porton Down, Wiltshire,  have provided the necessary answers.  Unlike CS, the new agent has high  chemical stability and might form  highly reactive and poisonous  substances in the course of passage  through the body. Experts say these  should be long-term tests after severe  exposure to CR.  CR was approved by the Defence  Ministry in November last year, but  until two weeks ago it was authorised  only for use at the Maze Internment  camp which was burnt down on  October 15. During the riot at the  camp prisoners, used to the effects of  CS, claimed that a new agent was  used on them. They say it was more  irritating to the eyes and had a  paralysing effect. The Army denies  that it has used CR yet.

On the one hand a war  situation exists between the I.R.A.  and the British Army. Arising from  this, the latter, in the manner of ail  occupying armies the world over, are  engaged in a brutal campaign of  harassment against the Nationalist  population. This has the classic  objective of all such campaigns, which  is to detach support from the guerilla  army by means of terror. History  should have told Britain by now  (provided of course, that the thick  Saxon mentality is capable of  absorbing the lesson of history) that  such terror tactics invariably achieve  the contrary result. There is an  additional factor in this war of  liberation which is unique, and also  sinister. It is the Loyalist part of the  equation. By that is meant, the  Loyalist para-military groups and  their accomplices in the British  S.A.S., who are engaged in sectarian  assassinations of innocent Catholic  members of the population. If the  Nationalist areas were not subjected  to the saturation tactics and  harassment of the British Army, the  I.R.A. would be quite capable of  dealing with these Loyalist thugs who  shoot old men and children from  speeding cars, and disappear into the  safety of the Shankill, Sandy Row  and Rathcoole areas.  BRITAIN TRIES TO JUSTIFY  ROLE OF PEACEMAKER  Britain's Harold Wilson and Merlyn  Rees, ably abetted by the Southern  Irish Government assert that the  British military presence in Ireland is  necessary to prevent a Civil War. The  tactics * of the British Army of  constant harassment of the  Nationalist areas and leaving the way  clear for the sectarian murder gangs  to do their work, is a sure recipe for  the Civil War which they claim they  are trying to prevent. So far, the  I.R.A. has refrained from retaliation.  Britain would like it to retaliate, and  thus justify her role as alleged  peacemaker to world opinion.  However, as the only protector of the  Nationalist  population against both  the British Army and the Loyalist  murder gangs, the I.R.A. has a  specific role to play and is deeply  conscious of the feelings of the  people it defends. If the sectarian  murder gangs push their luck too far,  they may well find that they have  invited a retribution they will not  relish.  In the meantime the fight in  Occupied Ireland is costing England  so much in menand money, that she  will have to give up this last desperate  attempt of hers to get the nationalist  people to accept peace at any price.  Her stark naked terror of civilians  such as in Kenya, Aden and as advised  by Kitson will not pay off in Ireland.

The executive of the North's  Republican Clubs demanded  yesterday that doctors who had  treated men injured in prison  disturbances release details of their  wounds.  Mr. Jim Sullivan, who represents  some 120 men detained in Long  Kesh, wants the prisoners to be  allowed to state which representative  will visit them, rather than be forced  to accept visits from Assemblymen  chosen by Mr. Rees, but  who in  many cases advocate policies being  rejected by the inmates.   He is also demanding the Governor  of Long Kesh, Mr. Robert Truesdale,  whom he accuses of being a  sadist,   be removed from office.  On Thursday night British soldiers  in the Falls were  lifting everyone  over the age of 14 and holding them  for hours,  the conference was told.   Attempts are being made to  impose unofficial curfews in the Falls,  Ardoyne and New Lodge,  said Mr.  Seamus Lynch, a member of the  executive, which also charges the  army with failing to meet the legal  requirements about notifying relatives  if someone is injured or moved from  one police or army base to another.  Mr. Sullivan disputed claims from  some loyalist groups that Protestant  prisoners in Long Kesh did not  support republicans in the burning of  buildings.   The 'Red Hand Commandos'  engaged in burning huts in concert  with republican prisoners,  he said.  The Republican Clubs named Hugh  Walsh as being in danger of losing the  sight in one eye, and to have had  three teeth lodged in the roof of his  mouth after having a gas canister fired  at point-blank range in his face. It  was, they said, three hours before he  received hospital treatment.  They said three prisoners were  treated for injuries caused when   barbed-wire strands were lodged  round the necks of prisoners trying to  escape the inslaught of the British  troops.    Total known cases treated at the  Royal Victoria Hospital was 70 with  more arriving as late as midnight on  Wednesday.  They also understood  109 men were treated in Musgrave  Park Hospital, and that three cases  were flown for specialised treatment  to Altnaqelvin Hospital, Derry.  rFLOOR SCRAPING  AND  REFINISHING  EXPERT  I   WORKMANSHIP  CALL ANYTIME  'X   P  John Cooper 212-881-5168'  J j Jim O'Gara 212-367-7128J  New Books On Ireland  FREEDOM STRUGGLE  1  By The Provisional IRA  EIRE NUA  By Ruairi 0 Bradaigh   150   100  ULSTER  100  POSTAGE 50t EXTRA FOR 2 BOOKS  WRITE:  THE IRISH NORTHERN AID COMMITTEE  273 E. 194th ST., BRONX, NEW YORK  10458        J
