CD  LU  -J  O.  O  LU  Ou  X  CO  British Minister's Car Is Blasted  A BRITISH Labour Minister's car  exploded with his wife and son inside.  The car- belonging to Sports Minister  Mr. Denis Howell-was blasted in the  driveway of his Moseley  (Birmingham) home.  Mr. Howell's wife and son, David  (10), were  badly shaken  but  otherwise unhurt.  Mr. Howell said  Apparently David  and my wife were taking the car out  of the drive to collect my daughter,  who was with schoolfirends, when it  exploded.   Fears of a wave of bomb  assassination attempts mounted and  security was being stepped up as this  was the third bomb in Birmingham in  a week, the previous two having been  found and dismantled.  Mr. Howell, speaking on ITN's  News at Ten, said his wife had used  the car all day.  She drove me to the  station this morning and then did  some shopping in it.  I don't know  what happened to the car but I gather  the windows of the house and the  neighbour's houses have been blown  out.   Asked if he had any idea why he  had been chosen as a target, Mr.  Howell said:   I have no idea. One just uses one's  imagination. I am like a lot of other  innocent victims.'  Next-door neighbour, Mrs. William  Eard, said they ran out after the  explosion.   It was Mr. Howell's car. It was  parked at the side of his house where  there is a space and where he  normally leaves it.   By the time we got outside there  was a small crowd of people and very  shortly police arrived. Mrs. Howell  was perfectly all right.   Immigration  Program On  Cable TV  John Collins, Chairman of the  American Irish National Immigration  Committee will appear on the Irish  Freedom Show on Sunday, November  17th. Mr. Collins will explain the  many problems facing Irishmen and  women wishing to emmigrate to the  United States since the passage of a  restrictive immigration law in 1965.  Other officers of the Immigration  Committee appearing on the panel are  Tom Feeney, Nassau County, Sean  Kelly, Westchester County, and  Eugene Byrne from New Jersey. The  panel members will inform the  viewers of the programs being  initiated to correct the injustices of  the present immigration law. The  immigration problem is a problem  that threatens all Irish-American  organizations and in fact threatens  the future existence of the  Irish-American community and  culture in the United States.  The program also includes opinion  from some local Irish-American  neighborhoods. Pat Lyons, of the  Hi-Spots Showband is interviewed at  the Four Green Fields Pub in  Woodside. Sean Dunphy, currently on  a tour of the U.S., explains his views  at Durty Nelly's Pub in the  Kingsbridge section of the Bronx. The  Inwood area is represented by Terry  Connaughton, President of the Caelic  Athletic Association, and Jim  O'Sullivan of the Tara Irish Gift  Shop. Entertainment on the program  features performances by the  Hi-Spots Showband and the Sean  Dunphy All-Stars.  The program can be seen in  Manhattan on Cable TV, Channel D,  from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on  Sunday, November 17th. It will be  repeated Uptown on Teleprompter  Cable TV, Channel D, from 9 p.m. to  10:00 p.m. on Tuesday, November  19th. The programs are sponsored by  the Washington Heights-lnwood  Chapter of the Free Ireland Clubs.  HOUSES DAMAGED  Police said the blast had damaged  houses nearby with many windows  blown in.  They refused to confirm whether  or not it was a car bomb.  There was no warning given as far  as we know,  said a police  spokesman.  Earlier in the day, Army bomb  disposal experts dismantled a bomb  attached under a car belonging to a  Birmingham   city   magistrate,   Col.  IN CHICAGO IT'S  O'NEILL'S LOUNGE  6100 North West Avenue  Chicago, Illinois 60039  ENTERTAINMENT FRI.   SAT.  (312) ME 7-9888  Geoffrey Grey, in the garage of his  home in Bristol Street, Edgbaston.  It was a similar device to that  found attached to the underside of a  car belonging to magistrate, Mrs.  Eunice Sard, of Wheeleys Road,  Edgbaston, last Thursday when five  sticks of gelignite were used.  Mr. Howell was among Ministers at  the traditional eve-of-Parliament  party at 10 Downing Street when the  car exploded.  Provos Threaten  Black Watch  THREATS of retaliation against  the 1st Battalion, the Black Watch,  which completed a tour of duty in  Andersontown, Belfast, last month,  have been made by the Provisional  I.R.A.  The unit has moved to Colchester  to rejoin families there. Strict security  precautions have been put into effect  at Colchester to guard against possible  reprisal action.  In a statement, the Provisional  I.R.A.'s 1st Battalion in  Andersonstown declared:  We will  not be forced into a stand-up  confrontation with British troops. We  will pick our own time and place.   The Provisionals claimed that  retaliatory action would be taken  because the Black Watch had  acted  like animals  and  terrorised  the  people of Andersonstown.  Whether the threat of reprisals is  merely part of a continuing  propaganda war or not, security  officials at the British army's  Northern Ireland headquarters at  Lisburn said that it obviously could  not be ignored.  The attacks on the Paras at  Aldershot in retaliation for Bloody  Sunday, and last week's bomb at  Ballykinlar, Co. Down, claimed by  the South Down Provisional I.R.A. as  a retaliation against the 1st Battalion,  Duke of Edinburgh's Royal  Regiment, are sufficient precedent to  arouse concern.  All units leaving Northern Ireland  are warned to watch for possible  action by the I.R.A. in England.This  warning will be repeated to members  of the Black Watch.  Officially, the army were saying  little.'They confined their comments  to a brief statement which said:  'Threats such as these are nothing  new from the Provisional I.R.A.   Security sources disclosed the  contents of a hand-written letter  caught in transit between Dave  Morely, said to be Officer  Commanding the Provisional I.R.A.'s  4th Battalion in the Prison, and  Brendan  Darkie  Hughes, former  Belfast Brigade leader, now in  Crumlin Road Jail.  lt;   UNITED EFFORT   The letter was intercepted on  Saturday when a prisoner being  moved to Crumlin Road was spotted  trying to slip it under the daor of  Hughes's cell. In it, Morley  congratulated the prisoners in  Crumlin Road Jail on their riots the  day after Republican prisoners burnt  more than half the camp down.  It said:  This united effort in the  prisons in the North has illustrated  the determination of I.R.A.  volunteers never to bow the knee to  the enemy, even when captured and  greatly outnumbered.  Morley goes on to say that things  are improving in Long Kesh and that  morale is high. Most of those who  received cuts and bruises had  recovered, and those in hospital were  expected back in the next week or so.  A statement smuggled out from  sentenced Republican prisoners in  Long Kesh said they were not  interested in meeting a three-man  delegation from the S.D.L.P. due to  visit the jail tomorrow.  9  *  ********* **      NEWS FROM CHIGAGO*  By John A.
