CM  LU  LU  North's Jail Riots  Cost   2 Million  Mmm   iM Mm  Damage estimated at nearly   2  million was caused in the Northern  Ireland Concentration Camp and Jail  riots two weeks ago, the Secretary of  State Merlyn Rees told the British  House of Commons on October 30th.  He said  the damage done at Long  Kesh would cost one and a half  million pounds, while that at  Magilligan Camp amounted to over  two hundred thousand pounds.  He  did not give any estimate for the  repairs of Crumlin Road or Armagh  Prison.  Mr. Rees appeared to hint at new  measures for the separation of  detainees and convicted prisoners,  saying that he hoped to make a  statement shortly. He was  unforthcoming on the question of  building a new permanent prison in  Northern Ireland, a project which  would take several years. It is known  that after Direct Rule was first  imposed in 1972, it was proposed to  build a new prison at Magilligan but  this was rejected on a number of  grounds, including the proximity to  the Republic.  Mr. Rees said that more than a  thousand internees and detainees  took part in the Long Kesh riot and  that  in the circumstances it was  remarkable that there were so few  casualties .  ARROGANT CLAIM BY  REES REFUTED  Many men who were injured in the  riots are still incarcerated in  Long  Kesh and have not been hospitalised  them it proved ineffective because of  the wind direction. They claim  that  the helicopters were then ordered to  fly low and spread the gas among the  internees by the action of the  helicopter rotor blades. This  particular type of gas had not so far  been used anywhere else in the world  and in the U.S. tests carried out with  the gas on rabbits showed that high  concentration can cause permanent  damage to the eyes. It replaces the  old CS gas and caused much greater  discomfort and irritation of the skin,  eyes, nose and throat.  INTERNEES BOYCOTTSECRET  COMMISSION HEARINGS  As part of a continuing strategy to  make the system of detention  without trial unworkable, the 450  Republican detainees at Long Kesh  Concentration Camp have decided to  boycott the secret commission  hearings held inside the Camp to  review detainees' cases.  The boycott becomes effective  immediately, according to Mrs. Maire  Drumm, Vice-President of Provisional  Sinn Fein, in Belfast on October  30th. The secret courts would not be  used again because they had been  proved  to be a farce'   The decision of the Republican  detainees to boycott the commission  hearings, which recommenced this  week after a two-week break  following the camp burning, means  that commissioners will have to  decide whether or not to review cases  in the absence of detainees.

BRhlSH ARMY USED  CRGASIN LONG KESH  There is no doubt that the British  Army, used the new and more lethal  CR gas for the first time in Northern  Ireland in Long Kesh on October  15th. This new item in the Army riot  control stock was approved by the  Defence Ministry almost a year ago,  but until two weeks ago, it was  authorised for use only at Long Kesh.  Prisoners, who are used to the effects  of CS gas, claim that a new, more  irritating and paralysing agent was  used on them.  Internees also claim that when the  first batch of CR gas was used on  Knights Of  Equity  Convention In  Buffalo  Dennis O'Reilly of Rochester, New  York, was elected Supreme Sir Knight  of the Knights of Equity at the 79th  annual convention held at Buffalo,  New York.

An internee was shot dead by  British troops during rioting at Long  Kesh camp following a break-out by  Republican detainees early Tuesday.  A Catholic chaplain who was in the  camp said CS. gas was being used on  the prisoners. He said he had seen at  least 12 men spreadeagled against a  compound wire and being beaten by  troops. All of them were covered in  blood, he said.  Government sources said that 20  Republican detainees had escaped  from the camp shortly after midnight.  Eighteen of them were re-captured  and a full-scale search was going on  for the other two. A spokesman said a  tunnel had been discovered in the  camp during a search after the escape.  Meanwhile conditions at the camp  were described as shocking by an  all-party delegation of Assemblymen  who visited it.  Members of the delegation, who  inspected the camp on the invitation  of the North's Secretary of State, Mr.  Merlyn Rees, expressed fears that the  camp might be burned down again if  it were rebuilt.  Rev. Ian Paisley, D.U.P. leader,  who led the loyalist group, said the  conditions were really  sub-human   and the S.D.L.P. delegation,  consisting of Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon,  Chief Whip, and Messrs. Desmond  Gillespie, and Michael Canavan, said  that the conditions were 100 times  worse than they had imagined.  Mr. Gillespie said last night there  OGLAIGH NkhEIRE/VNN  seems to be no other solution but to  end internment and get rid of this  place.  These men have reached such  a state of desperation that we were  told that even if the camp is rebuilt, it  would very likely be burned down  again , he said.  Mr. Gillespie said:  We saw a meal  being delivered to the loyalist  compound in tin containers. It  consisted of beef-burgers or sausage  rools swimming in gravy and nothing  else. The men refused to eat it and  were existing on their food parcels.    I got a list of complaints from  Gusty Spence, the loyalist leader,  which said Governor Truesdale should  be sacked and protested that the men  had neither light, heat nor hot water.  The S.D.L.P. delegation said that  because of orders most of the  republican prisoners refused to meet  them but they had chatted to some of  them and learned of conditions which  were really  indescribable.   Rev. Ian Paisley said that in the  loyalist compound the conditions  were  sub-human  he said. There was  neither light nor heat and at night  men were using candles. One toilet  was so flooded that waders would be  needed to use it. In one hut with 80  men, some were sleeping on soaking  mattresses while others were lying on  springs stretched across the hut.  The Loyalist prisoners, he said,  were refusing the food as a protest  and were living on bread and tea and  a quarter pound of margarine per day.  r  i   UNITED   BROOKLYN   IRISH  BAYRIDGE-FLATBUSH  IRISH   NORTHERN  AID   UNITS  CHRISTMAS BENEFIT DANCE  (or the  Oppressed People of N.E.

Bishops  Again  Betray Their  People   WE NEEDTHEM   Last week saw two bishops again  calling for support for the British  forces in Ireland. Both bishops spoke  on the same day (October 22) and  both condemned what they called  terrorism.  The Catholic Bishop of Down and  Connor (which includes Belfast), Dr.  William Philbin, is a noted  Conservative and upholder of the  church-state alliance. On October  22nd, he gave yet another speech in  favour of British power, when he  urged Catholics to help the British  Army and the Royal Ulster  Constabulary. He said that everybody  must show their revulsion towards the  dominance of the organised terrorist.   Certain groups in Northern  Ireland  Dr. Philbin said,  Have by  now, ensured that our generation will  be marked in history by the stigma of  organised savagery. We shall be  known for developments that have  been destructive and evil-the  introduction into society of new  kinds of atrocities and of inhuman  ruthlessness in their execution. As  one phase of barbarity abates,  another unfailingly takes its place   the Bishop went on.  The bishop was not referring here  to the savagery of the R.U.C. Special  Branch and S.A.S. murder squads. He  continued, in fact, to plead for  support for these:  Only the agencies  of security are in a position to  establish the peace and order we all  need and desire, and to avert the  growing degeneracy of our society. If  we need them, as we do, daily and  nightly, we have also a duty to help  them .  Dr. Philbin made no attempt to  conceal his hatred for revolutionaries,  and his love for tyrants. Who in God's  name needs torturers and murderers   daily and nightly    The bishop continued with his  references to Satan, whom he believes  to be behind the principles of  freedom and the rights of man.   Enough of evil has emanated from  among our numbers-just now, our  most urgent need is to counter the  widespread corruption of our children  by agents of Satan . Perhaps the most  suitable answer to this pervertion of  principle and religion was given by a  Republican paper published in the  impoverished and crucified ghettoes  of Belfast:  The peoples' conscience  are clear-who clothed the naked,  sheltered the homeless and gave  succour to the oppressed?   ANGRY REACTION  IN BELFAST  In a front page article Belfast's   Andersonstown News  accused the  bishop of urging people  to turn  informer . It also accused Dr. Philbin  of  remaining silent on the fate of the  Long Kesh internees .  The paper says there has been   angry reaction   n the  Andersonstown area over the bishop's  statement, and claims that local  community leaders are concerned  that the church is giving approval to   the operation of plain clothes squads  of S.A.S. and R.U.C. men . The  paper also said that after the  intervention of Catholic clergy,  barricades were taken down in the  Lower Falls in 1969 and four people  were later killed in a battle with  security forces after police and troops  raided houses.  BUCHANAN LASHES OUT  On the same day as Dr. Philbin  spoke the Protestant Archbishop of  Dublin, Dr. Alan Buchanan, himself a  former British soldier, made a similar  speech. Dr. Buchanan said that it  must be recognised  that most  bloodshed in the country was caused  by irishmen . He also called on  people in the South to  do more in  supporting the security forces on  both sides of the border . He also  stated he believed that  we, as a  people, could do far more to support  Con tinued on Page 18
