en,      LU  -J  Q.  o  LU  CL  X  Cbtioria  9;  CO  E   gt;  o  H  FAUL  IS  FOUL  When we think of the many men who, in the full vigor  and glory of their manhood, laid down their lives without  a murmur of complaint or regret, we must ask ourselves  this' question   for what did they die? And if we are honest  we must answer in their own words, spoken with their  dying breath   they died for the full and complete and  untrammelled freedom of all Ireland. They did not die for  a prosperous Dominion or an ersatz Republic. They died  endeavouring in the words of Tone 'to break the  connection with England, the never failing source of all  our ills. They died endeavoring to make the Sovereign  Republic of all Ireland, in the inspired words of Padraic  Pearse,  not free but Gaelic as well, not Gaelic merely, but  free as well.  We are not honoring them, not following in  their footsteps, we are not striving to complete their work  unless we are working with all our strength to make  Ireland Irish and free.  Father Denis Faul who was speaking last week on  The  media and the troubles in the North  said that he did not  think the I.R.A. should be allowed on the national radio  and television to persuade people to their point of view. It  is obvious that Father Faul would have a free Ireland for a  chosen few but not for those who are willing to suffer and  die for their freedom.  Father Faul like other men would like to be involved  but don't ask him to take a risk. He has to be on the   right  side and who is Father Faul to decide Government  policy? Like his forefathers when they issued their Joint  Pastoral in the 20's that the 'Free State' and its Provisional  Government were the true legitimate and only civil  authorities in Ireland. The Bishops at the time called the  Republicans plunderers, raiders, looters, wasters, rebels  and pursuers of other unladylike avocations.  What startles some of us is not that he calls our men  'murderous gangs' but that he has the gaul to accept   5,000 from the A.O.H. to aid the families of these same  internees he claims have no right to freedom of speech. In  the future we would hope that organizations in this  country who indeed want to help the Republican  Movement would find some other way of distributing their  funds to the families of the internees and exclude a man  who from all appearances is using the sufferings of the  broken hearted internees and their families to swell his  personal library.  By truth and honor, by principle and sacrifice alone will  Ireland be free. If anyone has a right to free speech it is the  men and women of the Republican movement who have  fought for freedom. Who would challenge the fact that  Hugh Coney had a right to speak on R.T.E. and to expose  the horrible conditions he endured at Long Kesh     yet  because he was a member of The Irish Republican Army  according to Father Faul this disqualified him from  freedom of speech.

You will honour Gerard Coney's  memory best by ensuring the release  of his comrades and the achievement  of the ideals for which he suffered  imprisonment, rjpression,  inhumanity, and for which *ie was  finally murdered by the British  soldiers,  he went on.   I ask you to band together as  never before so that this will be the  last coffin to come out of Long  Kesh.  Mr. Corrigan said that some  people had advocated massive prison  escapes.  Only the men behind the  wire have the right to make such a  dangerous decision.   We, however, have an obligation  to back their decision to the hilt,   Mr. Corrigan said.  I think no man  should ask someone else to do what  he is not prepared to do himself. The  obligation is not on the internees but  on the people outside. We have an  obligation to destroy Long Kesh. We  owe that to Gerard Coney and his  many comrades who have made the  supreme sacrifice for Ireland.   Twenty-four-year-old Mr. Coney  was one of the 32 Long Kesh  internees who escaped from the  prison by crawling through a 195ft.  tunnel. He was shot soon after getting  out of the prison.  The three Republican detainees  who escaped from Long Kesh were  recaptured that night -- after just 20  hours of freedom. And, in what they  called a direct reprisal for the fatal  shooting of Hugh Coney during the  breakout, the Provisional IRA shot  dead two British soldiers in the centre  of Crossmaglen, Co. Armagh.  Elsewhere in the North there were  angry protests and demonstrations  over the shooting. Widespread rioting  took place in Dungannon, and major  protest marches in Derry and Belfast  brought traffic to a standstill.  The three escapees were picked up  by an RUC patrol on the edge of the  Andersonstown shortly after 10 p.m.  An RUC spokesman said a police  mobile patrol spotted the three at the  Milltown Road, in the Upper Falls.  One of the men tried to run off, but  was apprehended after a short chase.  The three are Edward Maguire  (26), Gerard Rice (22), and James  Walsh (19), all from the Belfast area.  The RUC spokesman said the three  were wearing the same clothes in  which they made their escape.  It is unlikely that the three will be  returned immediately to Long Kesh.  It seems more likely they will be held  for questioning and may possibly be  charged with escaping from lawful  custody.  The two soldiers who dies in  Crossmaglen were from the Duke of  Edinburgh's regiment. They were on  foot patrol in the centre of the village  when they were hit by the two bursts  of machine gun fire.  Three of the soldiers fell and the  others dived for cover. Two died a  short time later, but the third soldier  is not believed to have veen seriously  injured.  The shooting came just after  lunchtime and eye-witnesses said they  saw about six men in combat jackets  take up positions near the town  centre just before the ambush. They  were carrying 'ight sub-machine guns  and were waiti ig for the foot patrol.  After the initial bursts of fire,  those soldiers who had gained cover,  returned fire and a 15-minute  gunbattle ensued. A Saracen  armoured car was brought in to  remove the soldiers who had been hit  and they were airlifted to hospital.  The Provisional IRA later claimed  responsibility for the attack and in  their statement warned that further  attacks would be mounted in the area  in retaliation for  the cold-blooded  murder of the Long Kesh internee.   In Belfast the city was the scene of  several protest marches and  hijackings, particularly in the Falls  and Springfield Road areas. Buildings  in Ann Street were damaged by a  150-lb bomb in a lorry which had  been hijacked in Macouley Street in  the Market area of the city about 2  o'clock. The Lorry was enroute to the  RUC station at Musgrave Street but  was stopped at a check point by  police.  In the Springfield Road area earlier  in the day three buses were hi-jacked  but were later recovered. A meeting  of building workers took place at the  City Hall and almost 100 of the staff  at Belfast's main post office walked  out in protest over the shooting of  Mr. Cooney.  Hundreds of Queen's University  students blocked traffic at Belfast  City Hall yesterday when they sat  down and held a protest meeting in  Bedford Street. A protest march from  Belvoir Park to Andersonstown was  organised by the Irish Republican  Publicity Centre in Belfast.  Almost 300 dockers staged a  30-minute protest strike in Derry and  traffic in the city centre came to a  standstill when the Quayish were  blocked by a bus.  Earlier 150 workers from factories  on the Springtown industrial estate  walked a mile to the Fort George  army camp and stoood in silence for  two minutes outside the main gates.  Earlier 12 shots were fired at the  Rosemount RUC. station and shots  were also fired at checkpoints on  Letterkenny    Road    and    the  Continued on Page 17  SHAmnOCK  imponrs  3150 No. Laramie  Chicago, III. 60641  Open 6 days a week,  closed Monday  If you want something Irish  90 to Shamrock Imports   or call (312) 725-9622  Mid-Manhattan Unit I.N.A.
