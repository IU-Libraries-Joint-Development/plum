This occurred, explained the  Parliamentary Secretary to the.  Minister for Health, Mr. Barry,  because of the inadequate provision  of special residential accommodation  for patients, who, having reached  adulthood in special centres for  children, required continuing care in  residential accommodation.  Mr. Barry explained that it has  been the practice to transfer some  mentally handicapped patients to  mental hospitals, but now there is a  growing volume of opinion against  this arrangement.  Both he and the Minister, he  admitted, felt strongly that  psychiatric hospitals were not the  best setting for mentally  handicapped, and their aim was to  ensure that as soon as sufficient  alternative accommodation was  available no handicapped patient  would be transferred to a psychiatric  hospital, unless he was suffering from  some illness which would warrant  psychiatric treatment.  Moreover, Mr. Barry explained that  the lack of alternative suitable  accommodation' for adults had  resulted in yet another problem the  inordinately high proportion of the  present population in centres who are  16 years and upwards. The latest  available figures shows there are no  less than 2,117 or 44 per-cent of the  patient population in those centres  are adults.  Mr. Barry stressed that one of the  main difficulties in planning for the  future is that there no reliable  statistics available on the numbers of  mentally handicapped children and  adults in the country.  If we are to  plan with confidence we must have  firm facts on which to base our  plans,  he said.  With this in mind, he added, steps  had been taken to secure exact  information about the incidence and  pattern of mental handicap in this  country.  PROTECTION  In a talk on  Community  Involvement  by the Mentally  Handicapped, Mr. Seamus Kelly, of  Dunore House Association, said that  over protection can do as much harm  as neglect, but in the case of adult  handicapped, there must always be  some  degree of protection or care  depending on the degree of handicap  and the type of centre in which the  person lived.  Parents and relatives can help, he  added, by maintaining regular contact  with handicapped people in  residential centres and such contacts  should be encouraged by the  provision of facilities for visiting.  To integrate handicapped adults  into the community, Mr. Kelly said  there must be an acceptance by the  other members of the community.  One cannot impose another group  on to a reluctant community. This  can only defeat the purpose of  placing residential centres in  residential areas.  All members of a  community, handicapped or  otherwise have equal rights. It is  necessary to educate the  non-handicapped as to the nature of  the new members in their midst.   PARENTS'ROLE  Dr. Barbara Stokes, Medical  Director of St. Michael's House, told  the conference that the new  ministerial move towards the closer  involvement of parents in the  management of primary schools,  special or otherwise, was of great  interest and they now awaited the  views of the I.N.T.O.  The appointment of parents to sit  on management committee will entail  all parents of a school group getting  together to select the representatives,  which will mean more information to  parents, concerning the costs,  difficulties and anxieties of running a  school.  They might be able to help more  and to understand teachers' and  management problems. This type of  involvement, in the past, might have  advanced both sides, parents and  professional, towards the provision of  full and adequate services for the  adolescent and adult, sooner.  Referring to the social services for  the handicapped, Dr. Stokes said  there was still need for parents to  achieve this through their local  associations via the National  Association. She advocated that they  should press for the provision of  holiday homes for parents and  children together, for social clubs, for  hostel accommodation, for a geriatric  home and for more residential  accommodation.  She told delegates that if they  wished for more, better, or future  services that it was their responsibility  to take an active, interested part in  the activities of the individual  member societies to which they  belonged.  Three members of the RUC Special  Patrol Group were cleared at Armagh  Court of beating up a 19-year-old  Catholic factory worker after they  had detained him for questioning by  detectives as he left work earlier this  year.  Constables Arthur Miskelly (20),  Oliver Weir (23) and Jackie Boyd  (21), had denied assaulting Anthony  James Quigley, Cailan St., Armagh,  on May 1.  As Quigley and a young woman  companion left the courthouse after  the hearing, both were taken into  custody by uniformed police and  driven in a Land-Rover to RUC  Headquarters, Armagh, for interview  in connection with other matters.  In the witness-box, Quigley alleged  that he was ill-treated in a police car  and questioned as to what he knew  about the Provisional IRA. He told of  being driven to a quiet country lane  and claimed that he was ordered out  of the car and told to get down on his  knees and pray.  Quigley alleged that when he  refused to kneel, two of the  policemen started to punch and kick  him. When he tried to get away, he  was pushed into the hedge. Then he  was put back into the car and driven  to the barracks. He claimed that on  the way there, he was slapped across  the face and on getting out of the car,  Constable Weir hit him in the face.  DOCTOR'S EVIDENCE  Dr. Stephen Garvin gave evidence  of examining Quigley and finding a  bruise on the scalp above the left ear.  There was slight bleeding from a  scratch on the lobe of his ear and  from the lower lip. A slight swelling  was visible over the left cheek bone  and Quigley had scratches and bruises  on the left thigh and right knee.  All three police officers denied in  the witness box that they had  assaulted Quigley. Constable Miskelly  said the youth was bundled into the  car, but this was because of a previous  escape from police, the fact that he  was struggling and that an aggressive  crowd was gathering.  .Witness said he decided to return  to the police station via Mullinure  Lane because workers were getting  out of two factories and it was  not a  healthy area for the police.  At rush  hour there were traffic jams in  Railway Street which was another  particularly bad area for the police.  The constable admitted that there  were no marks on Quigley when he  got into the police car. He could not  say where the youth had got the  injuries.   I know Quigley has no love for  the police  said the constable. He  suggested, under cross-examination,  that the youth would be prepared to  take a hammering to  get back at the  R.U.C.

The  dry Sunday  decision was  taken at a meeting in the city of  1,500 barmen. They want a five-day,  40-hour, Monday-to-Saturday week  with overtime on Sundays.  The decision comes after months  of negotiations between barmen and  bosses. General Secretary of the  barmen's union, the Irish National  Union of Vintners, Grocers and Allied  Trades Assistants, Mr. Michael Cleary,  warned:  If the Sunday ban does not  work we will take full strike action.   LABOUR COURT  The barmen's claim for a  Monday-to-Saturday week went to  the Labour Court some time ago. But  the Court suggested that the barmen  go back to the discussion table with  the bosses, the Licensed Vintners'  Association.  Mr. Cleary said yesterday that the  discussions had fallen through. The  barmen were offered pay rises in the  supervisory and apprentice classes if  they would agree to a system of  part-time labour, he said. But nothing  was agreed to on the question of a  Monday-to-Saturday week. The offer  was refused.  The  dry Sunday  begins on  November 17, and Mr. Cleary warned  that pubs would not be allowed to  open with non-union labour or with  bosses pulling the pints.   If it is necessary we will place  pickets on pubs that attempt to use  non-union labour. Our work stoppage  on Sundays will mean a complete  shut-down,  he said.  AREAS HIT  He added that barmen would not  refuse to work in any individual pubs  which chose to give them what they  wanted.  Pubs throughout Dublin, and in the  Bray, Wicklow and Dun Laoghaire  areas, will be hit by the strike.  Hospitals' Report  Challenged  Comhairle Na nOspideal report on  the future development of general  hospital services in the Cork city area  was challenged when representatives  of the management and staff of the  Mercy Hospital, Cork, said that the  reasoning behind the idea of a single  hospital  did not bear up under  examination.   A preliminary report by an  independent architect on the future  of the Mercy Hospital, which was  presented at a press conference,  contradicted the comhairle report  that  it was agreed on economic  grounds and in terms of the quality  and range of services which could be  provided   that   a   single   (700-bed)  17,000 In Jail  Because Of Drink  Prisoners whose real problem is  alcoholism should be sent to special  rehabilitation centres, Britain's  Helping Hand Organisation said in a  report published recently.  Over half of Britain's 35,000  prisoners are in jail either directly or  indirectly because of a drinking  problem, the organisation claims.  Keeping them in prison at   40 a  week is costing the country a  staggering   38 million a year.   When they leave, the 17,000 men  involved still have the problem, and  return to prison time and time again.   The report,  Alcoholism and  Crime  says this is a  wasteful  way  of dealing with them.   The current method of dealing  with them is ineffective,  the report  says  Some method other than prison  must be devised.   Rehabilitation centres of the type  run by Helping Hand are cheaper than  prison U28-  30 a week instead of    40 a week for prison),  but they  give the possibility of getting the man  over his problems and keeping him  out of trouble in *he future .  Such ctntr.r :N)uid be encouraged,  the report says. And it is critical of  the failure to set up detoxification  centres.  The report quotes research dating  from 1966 which showed that 56 per  cent of ex-prisoners had a drink  problem, and 89 per cent of these  said that drink played a part in their  last crime.  A welter of statistics are quoted to  show that in the past 20 years beer  consumption has risen 42 per cent,  wine 100 per cent, and spirits 116 per  cent. Spirit and wine drinking have  increased 23 per cent, and 28 per  cent, especially in just the past two  years.  gt;  The number of patients attending  hospitals for alcoholism or alcoholic  psychosis has risen by more than half  in five years, and drinks convictions  rose by a quarter between 1966 and  1972.   There would now seem to be '  enough cumulative evidence of this  link to question whether our  treatment of alcoholics as criminals is  the most humane or even the most  productive.   The   cost   of   helping   a   man  towards treatment and rehabilitation  is far less than the cost of his frequent ,  stays in H.M. Prisons.

The  architect's report said that in the light  of present experience of large  building projects, there appeared to  be very strong grounds for doubting  that large-scale projects do, in fact  lead to an improvement in quality.  'There is increasing conviction  among architects that there is no way  that a satisfactory environment can  be produced in these mammoth  schemes. The individual cannot avoid  feeling lost and helpless when  confronted with a huge building  complex.   It must be accepted that much  ultra-sophisticated equipment and  facilities can be justified only in very  large hospitals. These facilities are  required for only a very small  percentage of patients.   It is considered that the Mercy  Hospital can provide a useful.part of  Cork's hospital services in both the  interim and long term.   Again referring to the comhairle  report, the architect commented:   We feel they should have been asked  what role the hospital, in its present  form, or suitably modified and/or  extended, could play in the overall  hospital services in Cork.  The architect's conclusions are that  the Mercy in its present form, or  preferably extended or modified,  could cater for at least 300 patients,  reducing the size of the hospital  needed on the' north side of the city  to a  more humane  size. Drawings  presented showed how the Mercy  could be extended by over 80,000  square feet.  RECITAL  Continued from Page 9  by   Mozart,  Strauss,   Debussy, and  Ravel.
