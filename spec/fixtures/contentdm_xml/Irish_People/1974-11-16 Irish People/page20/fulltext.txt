CM  (2  UJ  -J  a.  O  LU  O.  I  CO  IRISH SPORTS  By John Twomey  CO  LU  X  National Football League      National Hurling League  Kerry Hold Dublin To Draw   Clare Surprise The Holders  Kerry 0-8 Dublin 0-8  All-Ireland champions Dublin and  league title-holders Kerry made brave  efforts to serve up fast and  entertaining football under almost  impossible conditions at Fitzgerald  Stadium in Killarney.  To their credit, they defied the  elements and provided plenty of  second-half entertainment and  excitement for more than 10,000  spectators.  One league point each from so hard  fought an encounter does nothing to  advance the fortune of either county.  A drizzle-drenched sod and a wind off  the Reeks that, to quote a local,  would skin a gooseberry, made  accuracy and ball control more than  difficult, so a drawn game was  probably, in the end, an equitable  result.  But it was a result that even the  more optimistic of Heffo's hordes,  who made the long trip south in  considerable numbers, could hardly  have hoped for at the interval.  The Dubliners, with that blustering  breeze urging them on from the  scoreboard end, took a two point lead  in an early flourish. Then Kerry,  looking the sharper and more eager  outfit, began to force the pace, even  into the wind.  Mick Sheehy, from Tralee, a  dressingroom replacement for John  Egan, was the hero of the home fans  hereabouts. He kicked two great  points from frees and then punched  the Kingdom into the lead from Ger  O'Driscoll's cross.  The unerring Jimmy Keavaney  brought Dublin level, Pat Spillane  regained the lead for Kerry, but again  it was Keaveney who, with two  classical points, one from a free and  one from play, edged Dublin ahead at  the interval, 0-5 to 04.  In view of the strong wind, that  slim margin did not look nearly  sufficient and when, within 10  minutes of the restart, the men from  the Kingdom had gone a point in  front, a Dublin defeat looked almost  inevitable.  At this stage, however, Paudhie  Lynch, who had dominated at  midfield, but had taken a heavy  knock nearing half-time, switched to  full-forward. Spillane went top of the  right while Dick Spring, seemingly  fully fresh in spite of his rugby  exertions for Munster against the New  Zealanders on Saturday, came on at  midfield.  But, from the moment Lynch  moved, Kerry began to lose their grip  on this game. Brian Mullins, who had  been joined at midfield in the first  half by Anton OToole, now came  thundering into the picture.  He forced the 50 which brought  the balancing point from Keaveney  and then, when a Dublin forward was  fouled close in, took the resultant  penalty. But his hard shot, though it  beat diving goalman Paudhie  O'Mahony, came back off an upright  and was blasted high over the bar by  Bobbie Doyle.  Kerry, heartened by this let-off,  drew level at the match went into the  last quarter, Tony Hanahoe, put clean  through for what seemed a certain  Dublin goal; swept the ball wide.  Again Kerry profited by the mistake  to take the lead with a neat point  from a free by Brendan Lynch seven  minutes from time.  But Dublin were now doing better  than at any other stage in this hour  and must have gained the winning  goal had not O'Mahony managed to,  fly-kick the ball almost from under  his own crossbar. Yet, justice was  done in the end, when the ever  reliable Keaveney kicked the  equalising point from a free in the  58th minute.  On their lethargic first-half display,  this was a game Dublin did not  deserve to win, yet it was a game they  must have won had they taken their  second-half    goaling    chances.  Certainly, except for a couple of  first-half scares, Paddy Cullen had a  quiet afternoon in goal, thanks to the  excellence of a defence in which Alan  Larkin, Sean Doherty and Robbie  Kelleher were outstanding.  Not till OToole switched out did  Dublin come into the game at  midfield, where Mullins had an  outstanding last quarter. The  forwards, however, from the chances  presented, must shoulder the blame  for letting victory slip away. The  exception was veteran Keaveney, who  had all but one of their scores and  was truly the man who saved the day.  Kerry, for much of the hour,  looked every bit as promising as they  did against Offaly but, again, they  faded in the last quarter.  O'Mahony, John O'Keeffe, Jim  Deenihan, Ger Power and Kennelly  were the bulwards of a sound  defence.  Paudhie Lynch was, until injured,  magnificent at midfield, but their  forwards, like those of Dublin,  promised more than they achieved,  with Sheehy, Brendan Lynch and  Mickie O'Sullivan, when he moved off  Kelleher, carrying the greatest threat.  Scorers-Dublin: J. Keaveney (0-7);  B. Doyle (0-1). Kerry-M. Sheehy  (0-5); B. Lynch (0-2); P. Spillane  (0-1).  N.F.L. DIVISION 1  A   P W D L F A Pts.

Clare 3-6   Cork  1-10  Miserable weather provided a  remarkable contrast to the bright and  thrilling performance of Clare hurlers  as they overcame Cork in a top class  National Hurling League game at  Charleville.  A soggy ground, driving wind and  rain and, indeed, the reputation of  national league holders Cork-all were  brushed aside contemptuously by the  fiery Clare team.  The two sides provided excellent  entertainment for the relatively small  crowd. They went all out for the 60  minutes and every ball and challenge  was fiercely contested by the two  teams.  This made for a rousing, but  sporting game, full of controlled  aggression, with plenty of skill from  both sides.  But Clare were superb. On their  showing yesterday-they were full of  confidence and composure-they  must be in the running for honours  this year.  Every man on the team played a  full part in the victory, but  individuals in each sector of play  made vital contributions.  Goalkeeper Seamus Durack made  some really fine saves at times when  lesser men would have given way  under the pressure exerted by the  eager Cork forwards.  Centre-half-back Noel Casey was  steadfast in the middle, and his  clearances provided a springboard for  plenty of Clare attacks. Midfielders  Tony Kelly and John Callahan  dominated their Cork counterparts  and kept a constant flow of passes to  their forwards.  Up front, the veteran Gus Lohan  gave the Cork backs a roasting they  will not forget in a hurry, and also  scored two goals. Corner-forward  Enda O'Connor deservedly got Clare's  third goal.  Cork played hard and well but  their failure to pick up scores from  play was crucial. Most of their 10  points came from frees by Gerald and  Charlie McCarthy, Clare were that bit  faster than Cork on breaks and the  title-holders frequently found their  defenders a few yards behind the  speedy Clare forward.  The strong cross-field breeze  favoured Clare in the first half.  Lohane struck with his first goal after  only seven minutes when the scores  stood at a point each. Put through by  Jim McNamara, Lohan resisted the  challenge of Cork keeper Martin  Coleman and palmed to the net.  That wasn't too bad a setback for  Cork. They kept hammering away  but, as the half wore on, Clare got  stronger. Nine minutes from  half-time, O'Connor ran at the Cork  goal, looked to have lost control after  a tackle but recovered and scored  with a low ground shot which Cork's  John Horgan vainly tried to block on  the line.  Three minutes later, Cork were  really in trouble when Lohan's  goal-scoring prowess gave Clare a  further advantage.  He shot from close in but the  sliothair rebounded off a defender,  but Lohan scored at the second  attempt. The score at the interval was  3-3 to 0-5 in Clare's favour.  Cork, with the wind behind them,  fought desperately in the second half.  Slowly they picked up the points,  mainly from the free-taking expertise  of the McCarthys. But Clare were still  dangerous on counter-attacks and  they picked up a couple of points to  maintain their lead.  Four minutes from full-time, Cork  looked to have got full reward for  their efforts when a 21-yard penalty  goal by Charlie McCarthy left them  only a point behind. An exciting final ,  three minutes followed, but Noel  Ryan pointed in the last minute to  give Clare the two league points they  deserved.  Scorers: Clare-G. Lohan (2-0), E.  O'Connor(1-0), J. McNamara, N.  Ryan (0-2 each), J. Callanan, C.  Woods (0-1 each). Cork-C. McCarthy  (1-4), G. McCarthy (0-5), E.  O'Donoghue (0-1).  N.H.L DIVISION 1  A   P W D L   F   A Pts.
