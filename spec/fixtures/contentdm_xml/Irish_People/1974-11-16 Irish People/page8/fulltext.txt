00  LU  -J  0.  O  LU  O.   C  CO  Inquiry Into Death  Of Internee Sought  n     . L Jema ds  4 Remembrance   British Secretary  LU  X  o  E   gt;  O  The shooting of Hugh Coney has  brought varying reaction in the North  ranging from a call by the Civil Rights  Association for the arrest of Mr. Rees,  the Northern. Secretary, to a demand  for a full independent inquiry by the  Bishop of Derry, Most Rev. Edward  Daly.  The Bishop of Derry, Dr. Daly,  demanded a full and independent  inquiry into the killing of Hugh  Coney, who was shot dead while  attempting to escape from Long  Kesh.  Extending his sympathy to the  man's family, Dr. Daly said:  I have  asked that prayers be offered for the  repose of his soul at all Masses in the  city this evening. I am also asking that  prayers be offered at these Masses for  the ending of internment without  trial.  TRIBUNAL   I demand a full, independent  inquiry into this latest killing. As long  as internment continues and Long  Kesh continues to exist in its present  form the agony of the North will only  get worse. Once again I appeal for an  immediate ending of internment  without trial.   Mr. Oliver Napier, Alliance Party  leader, said in a statement that  each  incident of this nature reinforces the  argument for the establishment of an  'independent tribunal,' to investigate  incidents of public controversy on  this kind.   He said he would be asking Mr.  Rees to instruct the present,  government inquiry set up to  investigate the Maze disturbances of  last month, to include in its terms of  reference the events of Tuesday night.  The Civil Rights Association in  their statement said that Mr. Rees  ought to be arrested on a charge of  murder because  as the British  Government Minister responsible for  Northern Ireland, he bears the  responsibility for the behaviour of his  troops.       The Association described the  death of Mr. Coney as  cold-blooded  murder.   The statement also said that Mr.  Coney had spent two years and four  months of the last three years of his  life in prison  for doing nothing.   They say he. was arrested at the  beginning of 1972 and held in  Crumlin Road Jail for one year. He  was then released but was re-arrested  in June, 1973, and detained.  E (  StosS  Gulf Tankers Expected  To Return To Irish Ports  DUBLIN-Two giant oil tankers  ordered out of Irish territorial waters  Tuesday night because the  government here feared a possible  collision in Bantry Bay, Cork, are  now expected to return today to  unload their crude at the Gulf Oil  Corp.'s Whiddy Island transshipment  and oil storage terminal.  Flor Crowley, an opposition  member of Parliament for the Cork  region, charged that Peter Barry, the  minister for transport and power, had  overreacted in his decision to instruct  the VLCC tankers to leave the area.  Mr. Crowley, in a statement, said  that all experts recognized that  Bantry Bay was  absolutely safe  for  the anchorage of five large tankers at  the same time. When one considered  that 50 per cent of the business at  Bantry Bay was by charter,  it is not  good enough to order ships to steam  around indefinitely.   Mr. Barry's instruction to the two  supertankers to quit the bay area  came after he had made a helicopter  tour of the coastal region around the  Gulf oil terminal following last  weekend's major oil spillage when  another tanker was taking on crude  REILLf  BAR AND GRILL  1776 East Tremont Ave  Bronx, N.York, N.Y.  TA-2-9335  Compliments of John Reilly  for Spain.  It appears that the government,  ,and specifically Mr. Barry's own  ministry, were not aware that five  giant tankers were in Bantry Bay, the  location of the Gulf terminal, at the  same time.  This, the minister has since said,  was in contravention of an  understanding reached with the  company.  The minister reported to the  cabinet that he feared a possible  collision between two or more of the  tankers, although there are  unconfirmed reports from Bantry  that Mr. Barry himself had refused to  implement a recommendation last  weekend by one of his own senior  officials asking that all ships be  ordered out of the area and that  operations at the terminal should  cease pending a detailed investigation  into the oil spill. Work was continuing  on Thursday in clearing up the  spillage, and Gulf Oil has already  indicated that it will meet in full all  legitimate claims for compensation.  The company will also give its own  definitive estimate of the full extent  of the spill.       AWAITING REPORT  The government is awaiting its  report on the incident, and officials  claim that provisional findings suggest  that it occurred through a faulty valve  on the tanker Universe Leader loading  at the terminal. The spillage,  according to current official  estimates, may have exceeded some  600,000 gallons.  The government meanwhile, has  now decided, following this latest oil  spill, to establish a port authority or  other supervisory board for Bantry,  one of Europe's largest deepwater  ports.

In a statement issued today  (November 6, 1974) the Northern  Ireland Civil Rights Association has  called for the immediate arrest of  Merlyn Rees on a charge of murder.  As the Minister responsible for  Northern Ireland, he bears the  responsibility for the behavior of his  troops. In cold-bloodedly murdering  Hugh Gerard Coney, 24, an internee  in Long Kesh, Mr. Rees has declared  open season on all internees. While  the British people eulogized their  soldiers for escaping from Nazi  concentrations camps in the last war,  thirty years later British soldiers  gunned down an innocent man who  tried to do exactly the same thing.  In our opinion, it is the express  duty of any internee who has been  unjustly imprisoned without charge  or trial to attempt to escape. Hugh  Coney has spent two years and four  months of the last three years of his  Jife imprisoned for doing nothing. In  January, 1972 he was arrested and  kept in the Crumlin Road Jail for one  year. He was released with no charges  preferred. In June, 1973 he was  interned, but not before being badly  beaten by the Royal Ulster  Constabulary in the Omagh RUC  station. According to our sources the  figures for the people injured have  been grossly underestimated by the  Northern Ireland government. There  may be as many as 100 men injured  in the aftermath-mainly from  Belfast.  The Northern Ireland Civil Rights  Association has contacted  international organizations asking  them to protest this murder. NICRA  says that it is obvious that the British  government has added Interment  without charge or trial to its policy of  Internment without charge or trial.  The National Association for Irish  Freedom joins in this call for the  arrest of Merlyn Rees. In addition, we  ask that all people write their local  Congressman and Senators to demand  that they call for an immediate end to  the policy of Internment without  charge or trial being practiced by the  government of Great Britain.

Jimmie Steele  Seamus, James, Jimmie. His name in all it's forms is a close description of  the man. Dedicated to the ideal of Gaelic culture and language. Stern and  unyielding in his patriotism. Fun-loving and friendly he was quietly religious,  compassionate and charitable.  Jimmie's life story would fill several volumes, so this is but a brief sketch.  He was a member of Fianna na hEireann in the New Lodge Road area of  Belfast towards the end of the Black and Tan War and during the several years  of the terror-program against the abandoned nationalist minority in the six  Northern counties.  As a member of the IRA in the mid-twenties he worked unceasingly to  rebuild the IRA in Nationalist Belfast. In his youth and early manhood he was  already something of a legend in his home area. During the constant raids and  arrests his public defiance and courage were outstanding. Seized in a round up  in ,1934, his prison fight, twenty years in all, began.  He spent a year or so in prison at that time, and later in 1936, he with Billy  Mulholland from Old Park Road, and myself, were detained for three months  in Crumlin Road Prison.  In 1937 a meeting of the BattJion Staff of which he was Adjutant was  raided by the Special Branch and police. Battlion Staff with one exception  were arrested. The exception was later tried, found guilty and shot as an  informer.  Receiving long terms of penal servitude, they spent months in solitary  confinement, naked, on bread and water, plus periods of hunger strfke to  back their demands for political treatment.  During a  peaceful  period in the prison, he and Hugh Mc Ateer of Derry  and two others  went over the wall  one morning. The wartime black-out  covering their escape, they made their way on foot to my parents' home, and  were supplied with food and clothing while contact was made with the IRA.  My parents are both dead, and safe from British vengeance.  For the next three months, at the height of the 'Rourties campaign, Jimmie  was now a National leader in the IRA. The intense man-hunt to recapture him  was recognition by the enemy of the importance of his leadership, and finally  he was arrested by a huge raiding party in the New Lodge area and taken back  to Crumin Road prison, being the last political prisoner to go free in 1947.  Immediately upon release, he brought together the remnants of the Belfast  Battalion and the rebuilding began anew. Lack of public support shortened  the IRA efforts in the mid-fifties and towards the end Jimmie was again in  prison.  Released again in 1958 when support for the IRA was all but dead in  Ireland, he succeeded in holding together the greatly reduced numbers of the  IRA in Belfast. Concentrating on the National Graves Association, organizing  Easter Week Commemorations and IRA reunions, writing and publishing IRA  booklets, songs and poems he was the main force that kept the Republican  M6vement alive in the North.    During the next nine or ten years he came into conflict with the IRA  leadership, publically denouncing what he considered their betrayel of the  principles of the IRA and subverting it into extreme left political activities  with Communist Party connection. He was abruptly dismissed from the IRA.  Shortly afterwards the division occurred that led to the formation of the  Provisional IRA, with Jimmie among the top leadership. He died of a heart  attack in August 9th, 1970.  Jimmie and Anna Crawford, boy and girlhood sweethearts married in their  early Fourties. A son was born to them who they named Colm, a wonderful  crowing reward for the trials of the past. Colm was nine years when he was  killed by a hit and run driver a few yards from his home.      From Jimmie's letter:    28 Condara Street, Belfast, 25/12/61   You will understand how Anna and I feel about this awful tragedy that has  befallen us. It is too tragic to express in words and our hearts are so sore with  pain and grief of our loss. Even yet we cannot realize that Colm has gone  from us. He was such a comfort and joy to us, so lively and full of fun, singing  from morning till night or reciting poems. It is a heavy cross we are asked to  bear this time-yet we know that God must have some good reason for taking  him back from us so soon-   For the remainder of his life, summer or winter, Jimmie daily visited his  son's graveside. They rest together now. Anna remains at home, strong and  reliant, with her memories. Memories that are sweet, yet perhaps sometimes  bitter. Our hearts are with her particularly at Christmas time. Her address is  still 28 Clondara Street, Belfast.
