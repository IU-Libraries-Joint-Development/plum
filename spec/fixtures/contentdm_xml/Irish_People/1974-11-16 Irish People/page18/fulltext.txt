The few Dublin supporters who  opted against the journey to Killarney  would prefer to see it in the light of a  fine spirited rally by their favourites,  and this viewpoint would be justified,  for when the Dubliners found their  rhythm after numerous changes in the  second half they were most  convincing.  Tipperary had enjoyed a five  points' lead with wind advantage to  come at the interval, but it was they  who were fighting for the equaliser as  time ran out.  The Dublin changes, both  positional and in personnel, played a  vital part in the side's comeback  against all the odds. No sooner was  Convention  Continued from Page 2  Rochester, New York, was selected  as the site of the 1975 convention  which will be held October 23, 24,  25.  The following resolutions were  passed:  The 79th Annual Convention of  the Knights of Equity, a national Irish  Catholic organization, met at the  Buffalo Statler Hilton Hotel and  adopted resolutions demanding that  British troops be removed from  Northern Ireland and that they be  replaced with United Nations forces  to restore peace and order.  The body wants all of Ireland  united as one nation and its future  government determined by a vote of  all the people, both north and south.  The Knights condemned the  suspension of civil rights, and  imprisonment without trial, existing  today under English rule.  The decision of the United States  Supreme Court allowing abortion on  demand was also condemned as  murder of the unborn. It was resolved  to join  Right to Life  groups which  are seeking a Constitutional  Amendment to reverse the Supreme  Court decision.  Efforts to secure government aid to  non-public schools are to be  continued as the failure to secure aid  will result in the closing of many  private schools and deny to parents  their basic right to determine the  education of their children. Closing of  non-public schools is seen as resulting  in a monopoly of education by State  and Federal government and contrary  to the history of education in  America allowing parents freedom of  choice in education.  ipperary   gt;ing Draw  Tom Grealish switched from midfield  to left corner forward than he was  chasing a ball sent through by Pat  Quigley to hammer home their vital  goal 12 minutes into the second half.  It was perhaps the one occasion on  which the strong Tipperary defence  was completely outwitted.  Eugene Davey's inclusion for the  second half to replace Mick Q'Hanlon  was also highly effective and he was  quick to justify the move when  scoring with his first shot a couple of  minutes into the second half. Then  there was the change which brought  Vinnie Holden to the left flank of  attack mid-way through the second  half, with Mossy Walsh coming in at  right half back and Mick Bermingham  going off.  The Dublin tails were up in earnest  once Grealish ran through for that  goal and Vinnie Holden had a point  almost immediately to leave only 3  points between them. Cunningham,  the tried and tested Dublin  goalkeeper, then served notice that he  was not going to be beaten for a  second goal, when saving brilliantly  from Paul Byrne and when play  swung to the other end it was  Grealish popping up again to hit  another Dublin point   1-10 to 1-8.  Pat Quigley began to raise his game  and the Tipperary midfield pairing of  Seamus Hogan and Jim Kehoe had  already lost much of its first-half  glitter. Noel O'Dwyer, however, met  his now overburdened task well at  centre half-back, but Dublin were  shaping as likely winners and a  palmed point by Vinnie Holden  followed up by a great left-handed  point from Davey had the home side  in front for the first time with fewer  than four minutes remaining.  It was Tipperary mid-fielder  Hogan, who salvaged a point a minute  later.  Too many of the Tipperary attack  were off-colour, John Flanagan  especially, who for once did not get  among the scorers, Francis  Loughnane, though, was effective as  ever, although three of his six points  came off frees. The Tipperary defence  was for so long the strongest sector of  the side with Jim Keogh, Jack Bergin,  Noel O'Dwyer and Tadgh O'Connor  up to his retiral doing best.  It was, perhaps, an indication of  what was to follow when Dublin  clipped over the best three points of  the first half, one a great effort by  centre-back Peadar Carton from 90  yards.  Cunningham inspired confidence in  the Dublin defence, which also had  heroes in Kevin Drumgoole, Peadar  Carton, Tom Quinn and versatile  Vinnie Holden, Harry Dalton and Pat  Quigley constituted Dublin's most  successful mid-field pairing, while  Grealish gained most credit marks  along with Davey as attackers.  It all left Tipperary with a strange  League record-three draws so far  from four matches.  Cv T  OH  TOCK  8Y OTTOT.

Yep, that seemingly endless past  performance line is heading for the  home lane. Preceding articles have  dealt with most of that informative  and sometimes frustrating  story of a  race in a line  but the rest of it  should be a cinch. The last article was  devoted to the  calls    the position  of the horse at various pre-determined  stages of the race: where he was in  relation to the leader, so you could  see for yourself whether he was  showing early speed, running what is  termed an  even  race (in the middle  of the pack, probably, getting  nowhere in particular) or coming  from behind.  Needless to say, he didn't get  anywhere by himself. There was a  jockey on his back. And the name of  the jockeys is the next thing you will  see in the past performance line. It  could be  Cordero A Jr  or  Valenzuela J  or any one of the  dozens of riders who ply their trade  at major tracks like Aqueduct.  Belmont Park or Saratoga. You'll  rarely see a boy (or girl) from the   sticks  on a mount in New York  because the competition is too keen.  Incidentally, the rider's last name  always precedes his initial in the p.p's.  Some jockeys, obviously, are better  than others. And the better ones win  most of the races, and most of the  cash and glory that is their reward.  The rider who gets a horse in the  money gets 10 per cent of the pot.  Frequently that amounts to quite a  bit of cabbage. For example, when  Big Spruce captured the long end of  the purse in the  250,000 Marlboro  Cup at Belmont his owner's share of  the prize was  150,000. Mike Hole,  who rode Big Spruce, received   15,000 for his less than two minutes  work. Not bad, but remember that  Mike, like most jockeys, had to come  up the hard way. Had to learn his  trade, gain the confidence of owners  and trainers, before he was given the  opportunity to shoot at the big  money.  What is the  hard way?  A rider  may begin as a groom, a  hot walker   (cooling off horses after a workout or  a race), or as an exercise boy. It is  easy to determine the ridirig beginners  in the p.p. line because they may have  a small numeral-5, 7, or  10   following their names (Long  JS7). These figures represent weight  allowances and the boys (or girls)  with allowances are called  apprentices. Before the figures were  used the novices were called  bug  boys  not because they didn't bathe  or take showers, but because the  allowances were indicated by asterisks  (*) instead of numerals. A  bug boy   had a five-pound allowance; a   double bug  boy had a seven-pound  allowance; a  triple bug boy  had a  10-pound allowance.  The allowances give newcomers an  opportunity to compete with more  experienced riders; get them mounts  they would never receive if they had  to compete on even-terms with  jockeys who have been through the  mill. The rider gets a 10-pound  allowance until he has ridden 5  winners and 7 pounds until he has  ridden an additional 30 winners from  the date of riding his fifth winner. If  he has ridden 35 winners prior to the  end of one year from the date of  riding his fifth winner, he continues  to receive that 5-pound allowance  until the end of that year.  There are also 3-pound allowances  and they are granted riders who, after  completing their apprenticeships, are  astride horses owned or trained by  their original contract employers if  their contracts have not been  permanently transferred or sold since  they rode their first winner. That's a  reward for the owner or trainer who  develops a rider and keeps him under  contract. The contract-holder retains  this advantage for one year. Loyalty  pays sometimes.  In studying the past performances  you will note that horses run better  for some riders than they do for  others. Let's say a horse hasn't won  any of his last six races. However,  seven races back when he won, he was  ridden by Jockey Zilch. Today he has  Zilch in the saddle again. It could  mean something. Give the shift your  undivided attention  A clue that may  mean money.  We'll continue the series next  week.  Wexford  Slash Limerick  Wexford 2-12   Limerick 0-4  Wexford were impressive winners  of the National Hurling League tie  against Limerick at Wexford Park  which was dictated by the gale-force  wind. The home side were totally  dominant for three-quarters of the  game and their margin of victory was  a decisive 14 points.  A strong defence, in which Mick  Jacob, Teddy O'Connor and Willie  Murphy were outstanding, tied down  the Limerick attack, who when  assisted by the strong wind in the  opening period shot the amazing total  of 16 wides.  Limerick had nine of those wides-  in the opening eleven minutes and for  that period of pressure they had only  three points to show. Wexford then  got gradually on top and only trailed  0-4 to 0-2 at the interval. There was  no change in the trend on the  resumption and once Tony Doran put  Wexford in front with a goal inside  thirty seconds the game was over.  They benefitted from a winning  service at mid-field from Colm Doran  and Martin Casey and when they  eventually relaxed ten minutes from  the end their second goal from John  Murphy gave them a lead of 2-9 to  0-4.

This was a greatly improved  Waterford team that brought out the  best in Kilkenny at Nowlan Park,  Kilkenny, and provided a most  interesting and entertaining game  with hurling of a high standard   Indeed, at the interval after Kilkenny  had played with the strong wind,  their lead of 0-11 to 0-6 looked  precarious enough, but they came out  a new team.  Gone was the seeming lethargy and  they soon realised that they had a  struggle on their hands. The whole  team rose to the occasion, and  employing superb team-work after  sharing a point each with the visitors  in the first five minutes, had some  magnificently worked points to  remove any danger of a surprise,  while the defence, with Noel Skehan  bringing off some tremendous saves,  completely nullified the best efforts  of the Waterford forwards.  Waterford had a point from a  penalty in the first half, but two  penalties in the second half were  blocked and cleared in the Kilkenny  goal, while a number of 70s also  proved unavailing, so tight knit and  sound did the defence become.  Kilkenny opened with three points  before Waterford had their first point.  After 15 minutes, only a point  divided thern at five points to four in  favour for the home team, but in the  second quarter, Kilkenny added six  points to Waterford's two.  Early in the second half, Kilkenny  took command, but their scores were  the result of really brilliant  combination rather than any  weakness appearing in the Waterford  defence.  For the winners, Phil Larkin, Nicky  Orr, Jim Treacy and Pat Henderson  were outstanding in defence. Frank  Cummins and Liam O'Brien stepped  up their game in the second-half at  centrefield and when the forwards  clicked, they gave a delightful  exhibition with Under-21 hurler Ger  Fennelly, who took over for Billy  Fitzpatrick, fitting in nicely with the  experienced Eddie Keher, Ciaran  Purcell, Pat Delaney and  Mick  Brennan.  Waterford was well served in  defence by Patsy Flynn in goal,  Paddy Coady, John Greene and Pat  McGrath. John Galvin gave a useful  service at midfield, and in attack  Mossie Whelan, John Kirwan and  Martin G eary were the most  prominent.  SCORERS-Kilkenny; E. Kehir  (0-8), M. Brennan (0-4), P.
