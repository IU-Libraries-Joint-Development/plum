        <pagetext>ERA  ERA supporters across the nation  breathed a well-earned sigh of relief  when Congress finally passed the ERA  extension.     In a 60 to 36 vote the  Senate pasied the amendment on October  6th.   The new deadline for Ratification of  the Equal Rights Amendment is June 30,1982.  Prior to final passage, ERA proponents were  successful in killing an amendment which  would have allowed the States, for the 1st time  in history, to rescind their earlier ratifications.  WOMANKIND  Many groups and individuals worked hard donating  money, time, and themselves toward getting the ERA  passed.   Now that Congress has passed the Extension, it  is not time to sit back or quit.   The most difficult task  lies ahead.   We must show the misinformed that the  ERA does Indeed offer mem what we have often heard  them say they want (i.e. equal pay and homemaker  benefits).  At first, many ERA backers stood separately   each  an individual in her/his own little world.   When  Congress continued to ignore the issue of women's  rights, ERA supporters began rallying together, showing  their numbers and their political power.  The Extension has passed; united Pro-ERA forces  fought and won that battle.   Yet, there is much more  to be done.   Those of us in ratified states must continue to give our support in every way we can.   We  must work to see that the unratified states become the  ratified.  It is time to turn to our co-workers and those we  have overlooked.   We need to show them the facts and  reveal the truth about the Equal Rights Amendment.   Too  many lies have been allowed to circulate and grow.  As Birch Bayh, Senate Leader in the fight for ERA said   I am hopeful that the 15 unratified states will recognize  that the Congress has stated clearly, through its recent  action, that this simple statement of human rights and  equal justice belongs in our Constitution.   With patience and with the same determination  women have shown throughout the ages, ERA will  become the 27th Amendment.  *    I      1  Write For WOMANKIND   WOMANKIND wants to publish YOUR essays, articles, poems, stories, cartoons, graphics, one-  liners, book reviews, etc.  Our only requirement for our contributors is that  they be female.

WOMANKIND EDITORS:  The enclosed profile article is the result of a two-hour  interview I did on a fascinating woman I met on campus  at the University of Maryland. A woman in mid life with  a retarded child and two other children, who without any  political experience or background personally affected  legislation in her state of Maryland.  As a result of her determination she went on to become  recognized as a leading advocate of the handicapped in  Maryland.  I realize that you do not pay for contributions;  however, I feel that women need to see that they are not  alone in many of the fears and obstacles they may be  facing.  A 31-year-old journalism student at the University of  Maryland, I am minoring in Women's Studies and have  a particular interest in returning women students. I am  currently beginning a study of returning women students  with pre-school age children.  Thank you for your consideration,  Sincerely,  Cynthia Goodenough -Lang  Breaking Out-  Women In Transition  by   CYNTHIA GOODENOUGH-LANG  The homemaker interested in starting a career faces  many obstacles in making the transition to a new role. A  certain determination is needed to meet the resistances  and to survive the challenges that lead to success; and  education is clearly an important factor.  Betty Jean Taylor, 43, of Oxon Hill, Maryland,  provides some insight into what it is like to leave the  home and enter the male-dominated arena of politics.  Her new-found occupation: Advocate.  Taylor grew up in the traditional South and raised herself and her brother from the time she was ten. After  high school she left her home in North Carolina and went  to Washington, D.C. to support herself as a government  employee. In 1952, at 22, she married and three years  later discovered that her 2-year-old daughter was retarded as a result of a bout with encephalitis.   IT WAS SO TRAGIC, SO PAINFUL,  recalled  Taylor,  I couldn't sleep for days or look at another little  girl without crying.  Another child was then on the way  and even another a few years later.   I tried to be a perfect housekeeper, but I was too independent to be a perfect wife; I changed 'obey' to  'cherish' in my marriage vows. I did a lot of sewing,  home decorating and a lot of cooking, but I was never  completely happy and I could not understand why. I  really worked hard taking care of the kids and runing  my house, all the while feeling this restless feeling inside, not wanting to say outloud why I was unhappy. I  totally subverted the notion that I had a right to do  something for myself.   The subverted feelings began to surface in 1970. With  all three children in school, Taylor, hoping to appease  that inner restlessness, decided to go on to college where  she says,  I was terrified. I realize now what a strange,  peculiar, backward animal I'd become by being isolated  from the mainstream of society. My first instructor was  sure I was either going to have an ulcer or a nervous  breakdown because I was so uptight about the course.   Asked what the course had been, she replied laughingly,   Geography   Taylor, by the way, got an A in  geography. As the A's rolled in, her insecurities and lack  of confidence gradually disappeared.  Betty Jean Taylor: Maryland's leading  advocate for the handicapped.  INVOLVED IN A HOT DISPUTE with the school  where her handicapped daughter attends, Taylor began  an intensive lobbying effort to pass legislation to correct  the injustices she perceived. She had a bill drawn up,  had it introduced, and through her lobbying efforts,  finally, in 1977, pushed Maryland Senate Bill 398 into  law. Her efforts were encouraged by her college advisor  and guided by her studies in a practicum seminar. As a  result of her studies at the University of Maryland and  her legislative efforts, Taylor is a leading advocate in  of the handicapped in the state of Maryland.  IN MARYLAND, MS. TAYLOR is Chairperson of the  Governmental Affairs committee of the Prince Georges  County Association of Retarded Citizens and serves on  its Board of Directors; a member of the Coalition for  Handicapped Children; the First-Vice President of the  Great Oaks Parent Association and has recently  received a three year appointment by Governor Lee to  the Maryland State Advisory Council for the coordination of Services to the Handicapped. Her goal is to  have a positive effect on policy and the decision-making  process which affects Maryland's handicapped citizens.  Betty Taylor feels she wouldn't be half a person today  if she hadn't gone back to school. She believes success  comes from  absolute, unwavering determination.   That determination is apparent as she speaks of her efforts to hurdle the remaining obstacles in what is essentially still a man's domain.  I see the social barricades  but lam not afraid of them. I just hope the obstacles  aren't insurmountable and if they are I will probably die  trying to overcome them.   Author:Cynthia Goodenough-Lang  DID  YOU  KNOW  THAT...

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  GOLF  BY    BETH    CORBIN  The 26th annual U. S. Women's Open, the most  prestigious tournament on the women's tour, came  to Indianapolis, Indiana July 20 - 23.   The Open  brings together the best of amateur and professional  women golfers  Defending champion Hollis Stacy was joined by  Nancy Lopez, Sally Little, Beth Daniels, and Patty  Berg a founder of the LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf  Association) as they tackled the tough Country Club  of Indianapolis.  Joan Joyce, who qualified for the Open, failed  to make the final cut.   Joyce, better known for her  fast-pitch in professional softball, has been called  the Babe Didrikson Zaharias of our time.   Joan  earned her LPGA players card only two years after  taking up the game.   At 38, she is the tour's oldest '   rookie   South African golf sensation, Sally Little keeps her  eye on the ball after a hard drive down the fairway. (Photo by Katie Niles.)  Nancy Lopez, ending her sensational rookie season  -- which saw her win 7 tournaments with a record-  setting 5 in a row - - was disappointed with her Open  play.   She ended in a three way tie for 9th place.  Lopez had a most impressive season for a first  year player.   Winning over  130, 000 (breaking  Jerry Pates' PGA rookie record), she is a candidate for not only  rookie of the year  but also   player of the year.     Thousands of adoring  fans make Nancy a candidate for  gallery favorite.   The reason behind  Nancy's Navy  is  best summed up by Nancy herself;  I really  appreciate the gallery.   They don't have to be  there, you know,   Three days of fierce competition in blistering  weather preceded one of the most dramatic finishes ever witnessed in golf.   It began with the  superb charge by Sally Little.   Little literally  brought the course  to its knees  firing a course  and Open record of 65 to finish 6 over for the  tournament.   The South African sensation one-  putted 13 times on the greens which were softened  by rain and had delayed play twice.  Meanwhile, defending champion Hollis Stacy  and JoAnne earner were battling it out as the  final twosome on the course.   The lead changed  several times, until it appeared there might be  a three way tie for first place.   It looked like we were trying to give it to  each other at times,   remarked earner, the two-  time Open champion.  After the rain delay, earner was never quite able  to put it all together again.   After an eratic approach to the 18th green, earner made an 8 foot  par putt to tie Little at 6 over.   After an equally  eratic approach, but much better recovery, the  only thing standing in the way of a repeat victory  for Stacy was a three foot putt.  She made it.  When asked to describe the best and the worst  moments during the tournament Hollis Stacy,  who became the fourth and youngest golfer to  win consecutive U. S.   Women's Open titles' replied:    I had a sinking feeling in my stomach  coming up on the 18th green.   That putt was  the best and the worst moment of the tournament.    In Noblesville, Indiana, rain hampered play,  but failed to dampen spirits at the LPGA (Ladies  Professional Golf Association) Mayflower Clasic,  July 1, 2, and 3 at Harbour Trees Golf Course,  Nancy Lopez, the rookie sensation of the LPGA  along with most of the top professional women  golfers were on hand.   And where Nancy went,  so went  Nancy's Navy.    That putt (on the 18th green) was the best and  the worst moment of the tournament, says  Hollis Stacy at the U.S: Women's Open.  (Photo by Katie Niles.)  Sandra Burns came on strong during the first  round of play, was 5 under at one point, finishing 3 under for the day.   Tied with Sandra were  Mary Mills and Jane Blalock.  Blalock,  fighting against adverse conditions,  remained three under at the conclusion of the  second round of play,  capturing sole possession  of the lead.   Jerilyn Britz and Joyce Kasmierske  tied for second.   Janet Coles turned in the best  second day score with a 69,  tieing her with  Nancy Lopez  and Sandra Palmer for 4th,  Monday belonged to Jane Blalock as clear  skies allowed the women to complete play in  the Mayflower Classic.   Pulling it all together .  Blalock was 8 under par at one point and went  on to win the Classic at 1 under par.   This was  her 20th career victory.  FROM  THE  EDITORS:  It was a rare treat this summer to see so  much sports coverage about women golfers.  The T. V. and the newspaper sports pages  gave the Open and the Mayflower space and  time.  Women readers who were not avid sports  fans suddenly were reading the sports page.  And why not?  Whole pages were actually  devoted to women.  A few years back, this was certainly not  the case. Women athletes were considered  freaky or unimportant.  We have come a long . . . and we're  still coming   The Gibson girl look of  Ruth Underbill.  amateur champion  .    of 1899.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  The Army Woos Women  by MARYHELEN CORRELL  Today you --the talented American female---  can be a carpenter, plumber, electrical  engineer, mechanic, communications  specialist.   You can pilot a helicopter, wield  a wrench on a tank turrent, qualify as a  meteorologist, parachute rigger, interceptor,  military policewoman, map maker or  culinary artist.   You can even be a missile  crew member, and if you aspire to be an  astronaut, you can begin taking technical  courses that will qualify you for such an  assignment on a day not too far hence.  Although it is rare to see a woman driving a  bulldozer or asphalt paver in civilian life, you  can do that, too ...   in todays  Volunteer  Army.  The choice is yours.   Ninty-six percent of  all Army jobs are open to women who are  performing well, challenged by the chance  to be   first  in a variety of fields, and perhaps  goaded by their male counterparts who may  not yet agree with a Ft. Jackson, S. C.,  Drill Sergeant who believes that  women can  do anything they want, once they adapt to the  initial cultural and physical shock of Army  life.   Women are quick to catch on . . . possibly  because all are  at least high school  graduates and many of those with college  degrees are,   of course, older than the  usual male enlistee.   They probably work  harder for they are still really on the proving  grounds.   But most who enter military  service know  what they want, and the Army  tries to give it to them . . .   job training  and choice of assignment, too, in many cases.  Only restriction is one imposed by Congress     no combat duty.  Thanks to the Army, however, doors have  been opened in many non-traditional skills      jobs that were formerly labeled FOR MEN ONLY.  The high level of performance of women, who  enter into their Army contracts with  determination, purpose, and just pure  grit   is showing the nation that women in the Army  are serving efficiently, enthusiastically,  effectively.  In fact, the Army is so pleased with its female  contingent that it plans to tap this obvious  natural resource and increase its total female  force to 92, 300 in 1984 (from some 50, 000 in  1977).  LOOKING BACK  It was not ever thus.   The Women's  Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC) performed  nobly in World War II while their men were  in combat areas.   Then, women filled routine   womanly-type  jobs, as secretaries, clerk  typists, nurses, librarians   ladylike positions  that were  safe , on the home front.   A  few of the more daring associated themselves  with the Army as ferry pilots, mostly spurred  by the quest for adventure dashed with a  spark of patriotism.   After  WW II, they  faded into the woodwork and only a few of  the most dedicated hung on in the new  Women's Army Corps for lengthy careers---  careers stymied at medium ranks because of  the few opportunities open to women for  advanced training and experience in a variety  of fields that would prepare them for higher  leadership roles.   Those who did break a few  barriers found their niches in public relations  or personnel, primarily.  Society in general in the 40's just wasn't  ready for women as military leaders.   Even  as late as 1967 there were statutes limiting  women's ranks to Lieutenant Colonel and  Navy Commander.  The males didn't take women in service  too seriously either, figuring that most of them  came into the Army to  get a husband   or  to get out of Podunk.   The jokes of the time  were most demeaning.  The new era for women in the Armed  services began around 1969, when the  Volunteer Army began taking shape.   Gradually  enlistee by enlistee, the quality of the Army  has been improving.  GRADUAL PROGRESS  Five years ago, each of the services rated,  for the first time, female general officers  equivalent--exceptional women who had quietly passed up through the ranks. Immediately  the winds began to blow.  The lady generals   not necessarily  feminists   liked the vibes they got from  women across the nation.   They put their  superiors on the spot as they insisted that  women have a greater role in the nation's  defense by working in the same jobs as men.  which in the Army meant, of course, equal  pay and equal rank.  The breakthrough was gradual ... a  female Drill Instructor at Fort Jackson . . .  a feminine Company Commander at Ft. Sill . .  a Hoosier teenager who became a member  of a Pershing missile crew.   Then the  big one   the acceptance of girls at the nation's three  service academies, formerly bastions of male  chauvinism.   The nation watched.   Could the  girls keep up physically, mentally?   Could they  adapt, handle responsibilities?  You've read their stories.   The women did  adapt, admirably. . . and it wasn't easy.  However, their drop-out rate was no greater  than the men's and after the first few weeks,  their male buddies applauded them all the  way.  From these women pioneers will come a  larger force of career officers who will be  the vanguard of an even greater female  leadership in the Armed Forces.  Today women are treated exactly as men.  They would have it no other way, an  Army spokesperson says.  At two posts, Ft. McClellan (Ala.) and  Fort Jackson (S. C.), there is joint side-by-  side training.   Fort Knox, (Ky.), is slated to  begin the system as soon as housing  modifications are made.  The Army. It's a good  place for a woman  to get started.  Bored with your present job?  At a dead end in your career field?  Check out the stimulating, challenging career  fields now available to women in the Army.  Security, adventure, worldwide travel, a new  lifestyle. Plus a paycheck that stretches further because quarters, food and medical care  are FREE.  If you're between 18 and 35, high school or  college educated, move out of your rut and  take a good look at the new Volunteer Army  .... which needs your talents. You just might  be surprised   CALL ARMY OPPORTUNITIES  13171 269 7654  No longer do men make so many jokes.  A few of the old timers josh a bit, but the  younger ones who have worked beside  women know how they perform, and take  them seriously.   After all, SHE is  competing for her next promotion   We've been talking about careers  .  What about the woman who wants to learn  a  take home  skill, who may not plan to  stay in service forever?  Nowhere can she get better schooling.  The Army's schools ar the best and the  opportunity to attend is there, in return for  a 3 or 4 year commitment.  Military police training seems to be the  most popular, prompted perhaps by a  abundance of TV features or an urge to help  cut crime.   The MP Schools are a real  bonanza for high school graduates not yet  old enough to be accepted into local law  enforcement agencies.   At 21, with Army  police training behind them, they can come  home with experience and credentials that  practically guarantee them jobs.  Four  years' training in languages, with  time spent at the Defense Language  Institute that offers some 35 language  courses on site, is good background for  any civilian industry.  With 30 days paid vacation each year ,  young women can do a considerable  amount of globe-trotting and make many  new friends.  In today's Army, women can be married  and have children.   Women are now  eligible for the same family benefits  married men have enjoyed for years.  Many husband-wife teams are finding  their double paychecks a boon that  makes Army lifestyles very appealing.  The Army tries hard to keep these  two-somes assigned together.  LET UNCLE PAY  FOR YOUR SCHOOLING  One of the biggest advantages to  women who find the Army intriguing is a  chance to pursue educational goals.   Since  all women must be high school graduates  who have scores at least 50 on the Armed  Forces Qualification Tests (in contrast to  31 for males ), most enroll in the  Servicemen's Opportunity College system,  operated by the military with  participating colleges nationwide.   Thereby,  a soldier can accumulate college credits  wherever she is stationed, then transfer them  to a particular college of her choice,   where  she has previously made arrangements, with  Uncle Sam picking up a large portion of the  tuition tab.  The Army also has a 2-for-l educational  plan to be used when soldiers become  veterans.   For every dollar the soldier stashes  away towards education, under the Veterans  Education Assistance Plan (VEAP), the Army  will chip in two dollars.   It is possible to  accumulate up to  8100 under this plan  during a 3 to 4 year enlistment.  Never before has the Army had so much to  offer women, and many women who are  dead -ended in a routine job or looking  for a new lifestyle, are giving the Army  more than a second glance.   Never has it  looked so good, and it promises to get  even better.  Yes, the Army is wooing women, for if  the Volunteer Army is to continue, it will  need more participation from women on  all levels.   Certainly, the challenge is  there   DID YOU KNOW THAT...  Men in college receive more financial aid and  higher grants than women.   Women receive only 5    of the most prestigious fellowships.

Review by  ANITA  SPEER  SMITH  Book Review  WILLO  Prose fiction by Karen Snow  Willo is the novel feminists have long looked for: a masterpiece that mends   with love and perspective   a generation  torn between the need to belong and the desire to be free.  The unusual harmony of Karen Snow's content and style  creates an intimacy with Willo that compels us all to remember who we are, and where we came from.***  There is a new inhabitant in my world.   She calls  herself Willo, the name being the other fragment of  the name Wilhelmina, which her parents had shortened to Mina.  Willo is simply here: walked in and told her story,  with all its tangles, so straight and without pretense  that there is nothing to do but accept her and know  her.   She and I are different, but if I had a twin we,  too, would be different.  I have said Willo tells her story.   The book WILLO,  is told in third person but the main focus is kept sharp  on Willo herself and the world's immediate impingement on that fragile but enduring person.   Willo is a  poet who painfully learns to stay alive.  Willo grows from no-love to love, and in the process something magical happens.   Willo's mother  has been one of the painful edges in her sensitive  childhood: a homely, untaught woman with a rasping voice, a set of ridiculous demands and opinions,  and a hurting demand for affection.   Willo had felt  intense mutual rejection between herself and her  mother, and only a growing acceptance of herself as  a sensuous, responsive person with gifts for drawing  and writing have rescued her from a similar collapse  into self-hate and ugliness.  But in her long, painful metamorphosis Willo recovers memories of her mother as a loving, almost  beautiful person.   It is as if the mother emerges from  a chrysalis as Willo breaks through her own encasing  shell.   Still able to see her mother's raw edges and to  hear the harsh voice, Willo comes gradually to terms  with the phantasm of pain and ugliness.  Willo grows from rejection of the fanaticism of a  Bible-reading father into a conviction and a strong  mystical experience that she is able to express to  Max, her gifted son, who understands.   The story  ends with Willo beginning to tell her husband what  her experience means to her.   Whether or not he may  understand, she is going to try.  This brave effort is a  new thing for Willo and is possibly what maturity is  all about.  Karen Snow, the author, has been  awarded the 1978 Walt Whitman prize  for WONDERS, a book of poems to be  published in February, 1979 by Viking  Press.  KAREN   SNOW  (You speak straight from that Catholic enclave.  A New Age has dawned:   My psychiatrist cooks  every weekend).... She dares not diminish this  already diminished man in the presence of his  sons.  Thus, the boys believe their father.   From now  on, they will be wary of this mother who neatly  succeeded in tricking them.  Willo clacks this resentment, too, back into  herself.

When Max tells his father of their  accomplishments at lunch, Melvin  snarls, '' Willo, you ought to be  ashamed of yourself: teaching your  sons to act like girls.   She bristles.    It's so pathetic to  be anxious about whether an activity is masculine or feminine.    You speak straight from that  Ivory Tower.    That old whine has  returned to his voice.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  CONCLUSION  OF  SOME OF THE CHARACTERS portrayed on  Days of  Our Lives,  seem to be true to life; however, the  following is the story of Julie Williams who has been  portrayed by Susan Seaforth Hayes since 1968. During  these years, she aged from 15 to about 35.  Julie's parents, Addie and Ben Olson, left Julie with  her grandparents when they moved to Europe. Julie  resented the fact that her mother deserted her so she  looked for love and friendship wherever she could find  them. She became secretly engaged to David Martin,  but stepped aside for him to marry her chum, Susan,  when she learned that Susan was carrying his baby. After the birth of her child, Susan refused to divorce David.  One day, the child was accidentally killed when David  was playing with him. Susan temporarily lost her mind  and shot David.  Julie Olson, who was pregnant with the now murdered  David Martin's baby, on the advice of her family, gave  the child up for adoption when he was born. He was  adopted by Scott Banning and his wife Janet and named  Brad Banning. Susan Martin became the next-door  neighbor of the Bannings and began helping Scott Banning with the little boy after his wife died of a brain  tumor. Julie sued to win custody of the boy; and since  Scott was no longer married, the court gave the baby  back to Julie. She renamed him David Banning. Scott  Banning had grown so attached to the child that he  married Julie in order to remain the boy's father. Julie  married Scott only because she knew that Susan wanted  to marry him.  Julie' uncle met a singer, Doug Williams, while in  prison. Doug was an adventuresome con man, and was  very interested when he learned that Susan Martin had  inherited  250,000 after the death of her husband, David  Martin. Doug, upon his release from prison, tried to win  Susan and her money, but Susan tried to get him interested in Julie to try to break up her marriage with  Scott Banning. Doug and Julie fell in love at once.  JULIE'S MOTHER, ADDIE OLSON, returned from  Europe after the death of her husband from a heart attack. Julie remains hostile toward her mother and was  very secretive about her affairs. Addie hired a detective  and found out about Julie's involvement with Doug. At  first she despised Doug because she thought he was an  opportunist; but in time, she became attracted by him  and asked HIM to marry HER.  Because Doug and Julie had had a recent quarrel, on  the spur of the moment, Doug agreed to the marriage  and eloped with Addie.  Julie began to make preparations to divorce Scott  Banning; but on the day she was filing for divorce, Scott  was killed on a construction site for the Anderson  Manufacturing Company. Bob Anderson and his wife,  Phyllis, became friendly with Julie, feeling the shock of  Scott Banning's death; and they became substitute  parents to her. However, Bob began to fall in love with  Julie. Bob left Phyllis, but Phyllis continued her friendship with Julie, not suspecting that Julie was the person  who caused the breakup of her marriage.  Addie was discovered to have leukemia, and thinking  she was dying after giving birth to a little girl, she made  Julie promise to take care of Doug and the baby when  she was gone. Julie was engaged to her attorney, Don  Craig, but she broke off this forthcoming marriage,  believing that she, Doug and Hope, the baby, would  become a family. But Addie did not die at this time; she  had a remission of the leukemia. Julie married Bob Anderson when he asked her, thinking material wealth was  important and that it did not matter that she did not love  him.  Women in Soaps  Then Addie was killed by a car while she was taking  the baby for a stroll. She managed to save her  daughter's life by pushing her out of the path of the car.  Julie, married to Bob, and Doug, now a widower, were  once again thinking about happiness together. Julie  discovers she is expecting Bob's child and even though  she is in love with Doug, postpones making any changes  until after the child is born. The baby is born  prematurely and dies, following Julie's fall down the  stairs. Julie then obtains a divorce from Bob; but it is  not clear sailing yet because Doug's former wife, Kim,  appears on the scene and informs him that she had never  obtained a legal divorce. Eventually, everything is  cleared up and Doug and Julie are married. Since their  marriage, they have had problems in connection with  their work; they worry about problems of their relative  and friends; but their personal lives seem to be settled.  We can expect some future problems though, because  that seems to be the way it is in Soapland.  FROM THE FOREGOING SYNOPSIS of the story of  Julie Williams, we can see how complex life can be on  the soaps. It is highly improbable that one person in real  life would encounter such a variety of experiences as  Julie does in her story, but many people have either had,  or known someone who had, one or two of these experiences. Susan Seaforth Hayes is one of the main actresses on the show, and it is necessary to write parts for  her so that she appears often. She is portrayed as able to  meet and overcome all obstacles with a remarkable  determination and poise. This is the story of only one  character; the plots of all characters on the serial intertwine, and all know and are concerned with the  problems of each other.  Time is very unrealistic on the soap operas. When  Susan Seaforth Hayes was asked in an interview if she  had any serious illnesses on the show, she replied that  she had had a sixteen month pregnancy with the baby  born prematurely.  ALICE HORTON, WHO IS THE WIFE of Dr. Tom  Horton, is the grandmother of Julie Williams. She is portrayed as the kindly mother and grandmother, who is  loved by everyone and is interested in the best welfare of  everyone. Probably her portrayal goes back to the  beginning of soap opera when Irna Phillips portrayed  Mother Moynihan as a well-beloved person. It seems  most older women are portrayed well and present a  positive image.  I believe the writers intended to write-out the part  played by Addie, Julie's mother. They evidently had  second thought about lettin her die from leukemia. This  might have distressed those listeners who had leukemia,  or their relatives and friends, because they would lose  hope of a curee for this disease. So Addie recovered from  leukemia; but since her part was to be discontinued, she  died by being struck by an automobile. She managed to  save the baby from the wheels of the car. The audience  did not feel so saddened at her death since to managed to  accomplish a heroic act, the great sacrifice, at the same  time.   During the fifties and much of the sixties, most  women were portrayed as housewives by the soap  operas. However, during the past decade, more and  more career women have been portrayed.

WiwlelwoMib  2323 North Meridian Street  Indianapolis, Indiana 46208  Call 923-5615  by MARY CRISLER  ON  DAYS OF OUR LIVES,  there are two women  psychiatrists. One is Dr. Laura Horton, who is married  to Dr. Bill Horton. They have a baby daughter and have  a woman named Rosie to take care of her. It is never  mentioned whether this woman does the housework, but  the house is always in perfect order when scenes are  shot there. No one is seen cleaning the house or doing  any of the cooking.  The second psychiatrist is Dr. Marlena Evans. She is  not married, but is romantically linked with an attorney  on the show. Recently, her identical twin sister in real  life was engaged to play an actress, Samantha Evans, on  the show. Samantha is supposedly ill from drug abuse,  and Marlena makes plans to have her committed to a  sanitarium for help. Samantha is wily though and puts  something in a drink she prepares for Marlena. While  Marlena is drugged, Samantha, posing as Dr. Marlena  Evans, prescribes treatment consisting of heavy  sedation, and Marlena is unable to convince anyone that  she is not Samantha. It really seems an impossible  situation, but the viewers know that it will work out right  in the long run. When the sisters were asked if the   Days  story was true to private life, both said that it  was coming out very true to life. Andrea Hall Lovell  plays the part of Samantha; and Diedre Hall plays the  part of Dr. MArlena Evans. In real life though, Andrea is  the one with the masters degree who, like Marlena,  deals with people with problems; and Diedre is the  Hollywood actress.  KATE WINTERGRAD IS HEAD OF Anesthesiology  in the hospital in which the various doctors work. She  portrays a positive image of a woman in a responsible  job, showing responsibility to her work and also for the  welfare of those she supervises. Recently, she had a  conversation with the Chief of Staff of the hospital, and  very smoothly convinced him that he should change the  shift of one of the married men on her staff from nights  to days so that he could spend more time with his family.  Soap operas include current social problems in their  plots. Jean Barton is a battered wife, who is presently  seeking aid for her problems from a Crisis Center. She is  portrayed now as being very insecure; but she has  moved away from home, obtained an office job, and I  believe the audience anticipates that everything is going  to work out well for the family. The husband, Fred, will  be helped and they, with their son Billy, will be a united  family in the future.  The audience seems to dictate how characters are portrayed on the serials. Valerie Grant, a pretty black girl,  and David Banning, a young white man, were in love and  planned to be married. This aroused so much antagonism among the viewers that Valeria was written  out of the program. She was sent to Washington in order  for her to attend medical school. The actress, who portrayed Valerie, was one of the stars on the program   Hollywood Squares.  She was asked by the host of that  show about her situation on  Days of Our Lives.  She  replied that Trish (another character on the show) was  having David's baby and that she (Valerie) had been  sent to  Sanford Arms.   The most important people to satisfy with soap operas  is the audience. When they watch the programs, they are  also subjected to commercials which advertise products  of the sponsors of the program. If the products do not  sell, the sponsors will not be able to realize enough profit  to pay for the air time.  AN ESTIMATED  TWENTY MILLION daily   (and  fifty million weekly)   soap watchers are known to be  housewives, young mothers, teenagers, men who are  self-employed or have irregular working hours, grandmothers and shut-ins? The cost to produce daytime  programs is ten to fifteen times less than the cost of  nighttime programs; and with such a wide viewing  audience of soap fans, it is certain that soap opera is  here to stay for a long time.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Season With Apostrophes  To Taste  BY    MARGARET    UNDERWOOD  Jean Robinson, Coordinator Women's Studies  Program at Indiana University at Bloomington. (Photo by Katie Niles)  NORTH CENTRAL REGION  NATIONAL WOMEN'S STUDIES ASSOCIATION  SECOND ANNUAL CONFERENCE  The North Central Regional Women's  Studies Association held its second annual  conference October 20-22, 1978, at  Indiana University-Bloomington.  The North Central Region includes all  persons in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio,  and West Virginia.  Workshop topics included:   Women    Health Care Institutions, Appalachian  Women, Lesbian Mothers, Curricular  Approaches to Women's Studies in K-12,  Women and Myth, Housework, Non-Sexist  Textbooks and Third World Women.  Displays of Women's studies books,  feminist book collectives, and feminist  art, in addition to films and entertainment  rounded out the conference.  Provisions were made to supply free  child care; a limited number of free  housing was available.  It matters not if I am suffering from a hangover, or the General Store is giving away free  popover pans to the first ten customers, as a  housewife who is serious about writing, I feel  it imperative to keep to a schedule as religiously as I would scrub the kitchen floor.  (Which is scrubbed much less frequently since  I adopted this rule.)  My husband regarded my sudden metamorphosis  from housewife to writer as symptomatic of encroaching old age and resorted to that old cop out,  ignore it and it will go away. My children, who  had to be fed each chapter intravenously in order  to complete a book report, couldn't believe anyone in her right mind would w-ant to write.  Having the fortitude to ignore these detractors,  there is the conspiracy between the publishers and  the postal service to be borne.   Out of (I won't  say how many) rejections, 99. 9  arrive in the  Saturday mail.   Since Saturday is the only day my  husband might have the pleasure of a firsthand  reading of that rare communique from our estranged  sons in academia land, he hovers over the mailbox like a broody hen on the nest.   It's just another rejection,   he calls as he waves  the brown manilla envelope, home to roost after its  six weeks sojorn.  Publishers should be required to mail rejections  not later than Tuesday morning so that struggling  writers will be free to lick their wounds in private.  Husbands, especially, should be shielded from the  knowledge of the outrageous amount of money ex -  pended on manilla envelopes, typing paper and  postage stamps.  I find it difficult to escape interruptions in my  schedule.   No one would bother Mary Lou, who  has a part-time job at Sears, for such an insig1-  nificant thing as a  big garage sale on the old  Post Road.   Though I know I might well be missing the  chance to possess an original Currier   Ives print  for a measly 50 cents,  I stick to my guns.   I can't. I'm writing.     Writing what?   The first time I parried this question was years  ago when I suddenly felt compelled to write down  any ideas which came to me, no matter where or  when.   I seemed to be most susceptible to inspiration after my youngest's 2A.M. feeding.   The  first time I did this, my spouse reached across the  empty expanse of my side of the bed and then came  stumbling out into the light, mumbling  What are  you doing?

His ominous look prompted me to add the first  thing that popped into my head, . .  to my sister.    At 4:15 in the morning     With a fearful ex  pression on his face he led me, like a somnambur-  list, back to our nuptial bower.  But I learned.   When he shouted,  What are you  doing?    I would quickly answer,   Jimmy just  threw up.     I wouldn't hear another word from him.  That went quite well until he decided we'd better  book Jim into Mayo Clinic to diagnose his mysterious nocturnal malady.  Finally I gave it up, filing away bits and pieces  of literary nuance in my mind, waiting for that  glorious day when Jim left with his Snoopy lunch-  box and I was alone in the house all day for the  first time in 16 years.  When my husband discovered my preoccupation, he considered it a  hobby . Perchance  someone would question me at a social bash. . .   Well, what are you doing with all that free  time on your hands?    I write.    I'd answer.  My husband immediately turned his attention  to fishing for the olive in his martini.   Oh really,   their expression revealing they  were wrong when they previously passed me over  for the blonde with the low cleavage.    I'd love  to read...     I'm not published ... yet,   I would self-consciously add.  At this point, my inquistor joins my husband  in exploring the rocks of his martini in quest of  the elusive, fat, red and green, stuffed olive.  But, I continue to write, revise and rewrite.  I have desperately tried to keep up with the  times.  After I reviewed the torried memoirs of my  hitch in the Navy WAVES (in  the big war ),  I realize 1 came up like a latter-day Joan of  Arc compared to Hot Lips Hoolihan.  Love no longer makes the literary world go  round; it's do-it-yourself plumbing, psychoanalysis and sex.   You name it and there's a best  selling book HOW TO.   The Bobsey Twins in  the Country have taken a back seat to Manuel  and Juanita in the Ghetto.  Fire-breathing dragons  have been replaced by the Cookie Monster, and  that little old lady from Pasedena has just stripped  the gears in her MG.  It is possible that marriage and having children may again return to style, but alas, will it  be too late for me?  It's an undeniable fact of life that one cannot  blow the Social Security check on postage and  manilla envelopes.

(Photo Staff)  On August 26th in Indiana the first statewide Walk-a-thon for Equal Rights was held.  It was a success.  O  We STILL need an energetic woman to solicit  ads for WOMANKIND on a commission  basis. This job could prove to be lucrative and  personally satisfying for the right woman.  Recently investigators obtained new depositions  signed under oath by Kerr-McGee officials  stating that on the night of Karen Silkwood's  death, parties from the Oklahoma State Police  and Kerr-McGee jointly agreed to remove documentary evidence from Karen's car and to omit  it from the list of her remaining personal  effects.  In the dead of night, officials from these  groups entered Karen's wrecked car -- and by  morning the documents had disappeared.  In addition, independent accident investigators have concluded that Karen's car was indeed  struck from behind and forced off the road head-  on into a concrete culvert, killing Karen instantly   These revelations make it all the more crucial  that the full truth be uncovered.   Who killed Karen  Silkwood and what was she trying to bring to our  attention when she died?  Please help TODAY   Send Tax Deductible Contributions to:  KAREN SILKWOOD FUND/YOUTH PROJECT  P. O. Box 10037  Washington, D. C. 20018  Sixty-five people and one dog, registered as  walkers, earned   3,517 for their long trek in  the hot summer sun.   Added to   257 in other  contributions, plus an estimate for several  walkers who did not indicate the amount of  their pledges, the grand total raised is close to    4,000.  In addition to the sixty- six walkers, other  NOW members and supporters did jobs without  which there would have been no Walk-a-thonv  such as checking, giving first aid and water,  and providing transportation to pooped-out  walkers.  All who worked on the Walk-a-thon can be  pleased with the results; not only the money raised  and the publicity received, but also the groundwork which has been laid for next year's Walk-  a-thon.  Each NOW chapter whose members participated  in the Walk-a-thon will receive approximately  10 percent of the pledge money turned in by its  members; after expenses are subtracted from  gross income, 80 percent goes to National NOW,  10 percent to State NOW, and the remainer to  the chapter.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Why Are People  Potty Over Plants?  By PAT WATSON  In the midst of our technological explosion, people are  going back to nature in great waves of nostalgia and  yearning for the natural life. One example of this is the  indoor plant boom. Stop and think: How many more indoor plants are you seeing in your daily life than you  saw five years ago? Can you now tell the difference between a bromeliad (bro-me-lee-ad) and a begonia  whereas a year ago you couldn't have cared less? Have  you given or received a plant as a gift in the past year?  Indoor plants today are a far cry from the frowsy,  dusty rubber plants of the Victorian era. We can enjoy a  fluffy, ruffled fern in a room where soft green is perfect  we can appreciate the angular beauty of a dracaena  marginata (dra-seen-a mar-gin-a-ta) where something  with a line design is needed. We relate to indoor plants  today as never before.  AS   OUR   SOCIETY   BECOMES   EVER   MORE  technical, people need to associate with natural things,  and plants are that vital primal association. Our tree-  dwelling ancestors lived with plants long before they  lived with pets. Plants take us back to our origins and  give us the sense of security that all such associations  do. Mental patients have shown measurable improvement after plants have been added to their environment.  In our glass and steel skyscrapers, where the decor is  wall-to-wall ultra modern, plants serve to soften the  severe lines of furniture;, sometimes floor plants are  used as room dividers in large areas, to set off a special  place such as a conference table. The glossy deep green  of a split leaf philodendron or ficus pandurata (fi-kus  pan-dur-a-ta) looks especially attractive in a setting of  clear, modern colors.  Another factor contributing to the boom is that so  many more plants are available today. African violets  still have their devotees, and are now available in  several hundred named varieties. Bromeliads, those  strange, stiff-leaved plants with the spikey blooms, are  finding popularity. Orchids are being pampered all over  America.  There is great satisfaction in growing an orchid to  bloom from a tiny seedling. Did you know that orchids  have the smallest seeds in the plant kingdom? (The  largest is the coconut.) Orchids are aristocrats, and admired indeed is the person who can coax one to bloom  year after year. This is a status symbol to rival having a  mink stole.  Homes are bursting at the eaves with house plants;  one florist speculated that people are buying hanging  plants in record numbers because they no longer have  room for more plants on the floors or windowsills.  ONE OF MY JUST-MARRIED FRIENDS said,  We  bought a big schefflera because we couldn't afford a  chair.  High school and college students especially, like  plants   they're leading the back-to-nature army. They  grow aloe on their windowsills and use the sap to treat  minor scrapes and burns. They raise their own herbs  and nibble on alfalfa sprouts for energy. For new  graduates a plant can be a substitute for a pet not  allowed in the rented apartment.  As inveterate gardeners draw emotional tranquility  from digging in their gardens, so indoor plant growers  find peace in tending their plants   studying the color  patterns on begonia leaves, enjoying the growth of  terrarium plants and forced bulbs, growing-on cuttings,  seedlings and pups.  PLANTS GIVE US A FEELING of stability in an unstable world. They are, actually, living beings with  roots, and in our rootless society, they are a comfort  beyond that which we initially recognize. People need  green growing things; plastic plants just don't provide  emotional satisfaction   they get dusty.  As our technology increases, I predict that people  will collect plants in greater and greater numbers, to  keep themselves aware of, and comforted by, their  origins.  A  State Fair Winner  Submitted by TINA RAMSEY  This recipe makes 5 quarts of pickles.  You will need canning jars, rings and lids.  Tina recommends and uses Ball jars and lids.  They can be purchased at your local super  market.  Jars should be thoroughly washed and dried.  Lids should be placed in water and brought to  a boil.   Leave lids in hot water until' you  are ready to seal jars.  24 Cups Cucumbers sliced  6 Cups Onions sliced  3 T. Salt  6 Cups Cider Vinegar  6 t. Celery Seed  9 Cups Sugar  3 t. tumeric  6 t. Mustard Seed  Place all ingredients into one pan, bring  to a boil stirring constantly.   Turn off heat  immediately and while pickles are still hot,  pack into canning jars.  Pour juice to rim of jars and place pre-  washed lids and rings on jars   and you're  done.   There is no need to presurize as lids  seal themselves.   The pickles will be ready  to eat in just two days.  an independent womens news/ournal  women in struggle  politics, health, work, prison  news coverage and political analysis  on the issues that affect womens lives  contributing sub  12 or more  one year sub  6    sample copy 60c  foreign  13    Canada  7  business and institutions  20  oob, 1724 20th st. nw,  wash, dc 20009  *  On the day after you vote... come to a program   called FROM SUFFERING to SUFFRAGE.

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  The    Fiery   Amanda  Way (18281914) Z .  BY CHERYL BURNHAM   DENK  Women rank among some of the most interesting enigmas in American history, if only because  not as much was recorded about those who figured  into our social and political movements as was  their male counterparts.  Biographers of Amanda Way attest to the aura  of mystery surrounding this native Hoosier, who dedicated her life to the fight for women's rights,  temperance,  and religious freedom.  She has been described as both  fiery  and as a  quiet, modest woman  who  neither sought nor received wide acclaim.     Yet, there she is--making  waves for freedom in Indiana, Kansas, and California,  and wherever else she spoke.  Born July 10, 1828, 150 years ago, in Winchester.  Indiana, Amanda was the first daughter and the  second of eight children to Matthew and Hannah  (Martin) Way.   Descended from Quaker pioneers on  her father's side, she received her education in  public schools at Randolph Seminary in Winchester  and taught school for a while after her graduation.  But, she took up millinery and dressmaking and operated a tailorshop later in order to support her widowed mother and a sister's orphaned children.  Like many women devoted to causes, she never  married.  Amanda began her public career as social reformer at an anti-slavery meeting in Greensboro,  Henry County, Indiana.   It was there in 1851 that  she offered a resolution calling for a state women's  rights convention in Indiana.   And, on October 14  of that same year,  she was elected vice-president  of the newly-formed Indiana Suffrage Association,  which resulted in Dublin,  Wayne County.  It was at this first meeting of the organization  which would later change its name to Indiana Women's Rights Association, that Amanda stated  their cause:   Unless women demand their rights  politically, socially, and financially, they will continue in the future as in the past, to be classed  with Negroes, animals, insane persons, idiots, and infants.    Obviously, the condition of Negroes, animals, insane persons, idiots and infants was not good in 1851.

BOX 16306  INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA  46216  Amanda figured prominently in the society for the  next nine years and served as its president in 1855.  In 1859, she also assisted Mrs. Sarah E. Underhill  in editing the Indianapolis newspaper,    The Woman's Tribune.    It was also in 1859 that representatives from the  Indiana Woman's Rights Association became the  first women to address a joint session of the Indiana legislature.  Other leaders emerged.   May Wright Sewall,  an Indianapolis suffrage leader, later became  founder or co-founder of more than 50 organizations, including the International Council of  Women.  But, Amanda Way could not allow women's  rights to be her sole concern.  In 1854 she organized the  Woman's Temperance Army  in Winchester, Indiana.   This was 20  years before the saloon closing effort of the 1870's  by women like Amanda.  She was also a lecturer and organizer of a temperance lodge, the Independent Order of Good Templars, and was the first woman elected Grand Worthy  Chief Templar.  During the Civil War, Amanda turned her energies to serving on the battlefields and in hospitals  as a nurse.   Four of her brothers also served during  the war.  Later, able to return to her unfinished tasks, she  became a delegate to the convention in 1869 which  organized the National Prohibition Party, and, also,  that same year, reactivated the women's rights movement in Indiana by issuing a call for a state convention at which the pre-war society was reorganized as  the Indiana. Woman's Suffrage Association.   It was a  branch of Lucy Stone's American Woman Suffrage  Association.  In January of 1871, Amanda was granted a hearing by the state legislature and read before it a memorial from the state society asking for an amendment to the Indiana constitution permitting women  the right to vote.  FRAGMENTS  By Sappho  Later in 1871, the Richmond district of North Indiana Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church  licensed her as a  local preacher  and she entered  energetically upon an itinerant ministry in the  churches of Indiana and Kansas.   Born a Quaker,  Amanda had become a Methodist several years before.  She moved to Kansas in 1872 and continued her  interests in temperance, women's rights,  and religion   and she lectured and preached on them  all.  Amanda played some part in helping secure the  prohibition amendment to the Kansas constitution  in 1880 and was founder and first president of the  Woman's Christian Temperance Union in that state.  Although tending to church and temperance activities for the most part, Amanda remained a suffragist, and in 1880 was a Kansas delegate to a Chicago convention called by the National Woman Suffrage Association to exert pressure on the Republican  National Convention meeting in that city.  That same year (1880 ) the General Conference of  the Methodist Episcopal Church confirmed action of  previous conferences in discontinuing the licensing  of women as local preachers.   Because of this Amanda  returned to the Society of Friends (Quakers), where she  served as a pastor for the rest of her life.  Around the turn of the century, she left Kansas for  the West.   After a short stay in Idaho, she traveled to  Southern California, spending the last few years in  Whittier, where she was minister at the Quaker  monthly meetings.  Described by one biographer as  an indefatigable  lecturer on behalf of anti-slavery, woman's rights,  and temperance in the Middle West,    Amanda was  one of the last survivors of pre-Civil War era of Woman's rights.   In 1905, at age 77, she briefly addressed the National American Woman Suffrage Association convention in Portland, Oregon, on her  early years in the  movement.   A strong, vigorous woman,   whose health failed  only near the end of her long life, she died on February 24, 1914 and is buried in Whittier, California,  having lived to be 85 years old.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  11  An Update  Jenna Kelsie was once a battered woman; now  she's a resident of Indiana Women's Prison.   In the  previous issue of WOMANKIND she summarized her  story.   Ms. Kelsie is serving a 15 to 25 year sentence for second-degree murder.   On October 6,  1973 she shot and killed her ex-husband, Dale  Graham who had forcibly entered her car and was  beating her.  The incident occurred on a busy public street in  Boonville, Indiana.   Graham's violence was nothing  new to the small southern Indiana town; during her  four years of marriage Jenna had been subjected to  beatings, attempted shootings, and pathological  threats.   She divorced Graham only one week  prior to the shooting.  Jenna was free on bond for three years while she  appealed her conviction.   The Indiana Supreme  Court upheld the trial court 4 to 1.   Only the dissenting Justice, Roger DeBruler found validity in  Jenna's self-defense plea and addressed the issue  of woman abuse.   The U.S. Supreme Court refused  to hear the case and Jenna began serving  her sentence in November 1976.  Almost immediately Jenna renewed her struggle for justice.  A request for early clemency was  filed and summarily denied.   Letters to elected  officials failed to reap even cursory replies.   Finally, she contacted the Indianapolis NOW Task  Force on Women in Prison.   The appeal to a feminist group brought action, and soon her fight for  freedom had attracted wide spread support.  Jenna's only avenue out of prison is through the  clemency petition she will be eligible to make in  April 1979.   It is around this event that support  work for her is focused.  Helping Jenna means more than working for one  woman's freedom.   Across the country other women are behind bars, paying with their lives for  refusing another attack by an abusive male.  Although we would have supported Jenna's struggle on its individual merits alone, the Task Force  on Women in Prison sees vast political implications  within her situation.   We have long been aware  that most women convicted of violent crimes acted  in retaliation or self-defense against abusing men.  During the original trial proceedings, Jenna's defense was virtually nonexistent.   Although she had  been severely beating prior to the shooting, her  lawyer did not even request a physical examination.   No change of venue was requested, in spite  of likely prejudice.   Both the fact that the Graham  family was influential in the community, and the  history of non-action by law enforcement officials  who had received Jenna's repeated complaints during her marriage and following separation (yes, she  did have a restraining order ) should have indicated  the need for a venue change.   Furthermore, although Graham's attack and the subsequent shooting had many eye-witnesses, only four persons were  called to testify in Jenna's behalf.   Several had not  been present during the incident.  The prosecution centered on evidence irrelevant  to the charges.   The prosecutor retained by the  deceased's family introduced such items as Jenna's  poor grades in junior high homemaking classes,  and avoided any discussion of her many beatings,  including the one which proceeded the shooting.  Meanwhile, the defense entered no objections.  No supporting evidence on wife-battering was introduced, no psychological tests were performed.  The jury accepted the prosecution's portrayal of  Jenna as an immoral, vengeful woman.   They  convicted Jenna without having to deal with the  fact that Graham was trying to bite out her eyes  when she shot him.   What man would have been  defended so poorly?  Jenna's trial and conviction were political plums  dropped in Boonville's lap.   The prosecutor was  elected as judge the following November.   A deputy who told Jenna many times that Graham's  brutality was a loving gesture was elected sheriff.  Rural communities rarely have murder trials, so  Jenna's provided a real opportunity.   She was a  pawn of sexist justice played for sexist politics.  As the fighting back increases, we suspect that  the conviction rates will as well.  We wonder if perhaps a larger percentage of  women are convicted for violent crimes against  men, although there are often extenuating cir-  On Justice ?  by CAROL HEGLAND  cumstances, than are men for violent crimes a-  gainst women.   The ACLU's National Prison Project found that 89  of female murder victims in  1976 were killed by men.   A quick overview of  population figures of male penal institutions makes  it appear unlikely that all, or even most, of these  male assailants have been incarcerated.   In comparison, while only 8  of the arrests for violent  crimes in 1975 were attributed to women (and  many were self-defense) , a glance at the number  of women serving murder and manslaughter sentences in the nation's female prisons would indicate that the vast majority of that 8  were convicted.  The oppression of women is political, extending through the criminal justice system and behind prison walls. Women who face courts and  incarceration learn quickly that equal treatment  is not their fate. Several instances from Jenna's  case bring the discrepancies within  justice  to  light.  Jenna pled self-defense in response to the murder charge.   Considering her gender, had she pled  insanity she might have been acquitted or convicted on a lesser charge.   Recent cases indicate  that it is acceptable for a woman to be crazy, but  not to feel she has a right to defend herself when  her life is in danger.  Francine Hughes, the Michigan woman who set  fire to her house, killing her sleeping husband,  was acquitted of murder last year on an insanity  plea.   Ms. Hughes had been an abused wife; however, a beating was not in progress at the time of  the murder.  Jenna's worst crime may have been, at least to  the jury, her belief that her life had value.

Bowen.   Her hopes  will rest with a few people whose job it is,  not  to judge her conviction, but to determine whether  society will be safe with Jenna in its midst.  The Clemency Commission acts conservatively,  rarely granting first-time requests.   The governor  reviews each petition, but tends to concur with  the Commission's judgment.   If Jenna is denied  clemency, she must wait another year to petition  again.   Second requests are often denied,  as are  third ones, and so on.  What can you do?  As an individual you can urge the Clemency  Commission and the governor to grant Jenna's  request.   If you are part of any political action  group, support group for abused women, or social  group, urge your organization to pass a resolution  of support and submit it to the Commission.   Help  us try to gain publicity for Jenna; contact your local media and write letters to the editor of your  newspaper.  How can you do this?   Under the auspices of the  Indiana Coalition on Domestic Violence, the Task  Force and the Bloomington Chapter of the National  Lawyers Guild are preparing a packet for use in this  work.  The packets will be available this fall to any  interested persons or groups.   Packets will include  a legal overview of the case, an organizing guide,  letter writing kit, sample resolutions and press releases.   Our timetable is to have letters and resolutions flowing to the Commission in January, with  letters sent to the Governor during March and April.  Already eleven groups have adopted resolutions  supporting Jenna Kelsie's struggle for freedom.   In  October a resolution was taken to the NOW National  Conference in Washington, D. C.  Support for Jenna has grown out of one group's  concern for her as a person involved in our work  at Indiana Women's Prison, and out sense of the  political oppression she represents. Other groups  have rallied to her side because they care about  this woman, twice victimized, first by a pathologically cruel man and next by the sexist system  of justice.  If Jenna succeeds, a victory will be won for her  sisters behind bars and for her sisters who still live  in terror of the men who brutalize them.   Not one  of us will be untouched by her struggle. Any one  gt;  of us could be in her place tomorrow if we dare to  say  No.   To help or to request a packet, contact:  Carol J.

I'm hoping  that enough interest was generated by  her article to make this one, which  discusses political implications and  future actions,  a necessity.  Also, I've found in the course of  nearly a year of support work for  Jenna, that some form of substantiation by a  straight person  is always  advisable.    Something in the average  person (yea, even in feminists) doesn't  trust a convict.  I also hope that you will print this  in full.   To my mind, doing any action for Jenna makes little sense without the political context in which her  conviction occurred.   In addition,  action for her seems unfounded without knowledge of her case back to  the original trial.  Thanks very much for printing  Jenna's article    The entire issue was  great, perhaps your best.

        <pagetext>2.  WOMANKIND  Perceiving Quiet Explosions:   Elizabeth Gotten in Concert for NWSA  Eighty-seven-year-old Elizabeth Cotten is in the  Indiana University room (provided for her) on the  afternoon before her concert.   Lying on the queen-  sized bed, she is almost asleep.   I am fascinated by  being near Libba.   Especially when I notice that her  fingers are busily strumming and changing chords in  the air even while her eyes  are closed.  I could list many adjectives about composer-  entertainer Elizabeth Cotten: warrr humorous,  wise - but still not convey her presence - like the  great warmth I felt when she hugged me for bringing her a small bouquet of dogwood blossoms.   It's so nice to have flowers,   she said.    Much  better to get them now when I can see them, 'cause  I won't enjoy them when they lay me out.    I don't know how many times I had heard  Freight  Train  before meeting  Libba that Saturday of the  National Women's Studies Association Conference. I  don't know how many times I was struck by her love  of singing/playing/performing:    I never get nervous,   she assured me.  Originally from North Carolina, Libba now lives  in Syracuse, New York.   She says:    I don't care  much for living in the country.   It's nice to be out,  but I miss having people around.    And so, she had people around.   As she came on  stage Saturday to a standing ovation, Libba sat down  glowing and smiling.   She loved being up front, telling us stories, hearing us sing along, and, most of  all, playing music.  I think that's a good expression     playing music.  Listening to Elizabeth Cotten. it's really not hard to  believe  she wrote  Freight Train  when she was  only 11 years old.   Music in the American folk/blues  tradition is  an expression that was/is a form of play.  At the same time, it's not hard to imagine an older  Libba, away from her home for the first time lying  on another bed in Washington, D. C. on New Year's  Eve, and  just playing  until she had  Washington  Blues.   the Night  On August 2, 1980, women across the United States  will join together in a national TAKE BACK THE  NIGHT demonstration. Protesting criminal violence  against women, this nation-wide display will focus on rape and demand that this most heinous  crime be stopped.  Every woman can participate: Attend and march;  send letters of support for the march and its principles to local papers and legislators.   Send donations.   It takes money to put on an event like this.  For further information in Indianapolis, contact  Gael Richardson (317) 637-4278.  If you would like a list of reasons why this demonstration is necessary, send a self-addressed stamped  envelope to 836 Eastern Avenue, Indpls, In. 46201 for  information and a copy of the  Indiana Women TAKE  BACK THE NIGHT Guiding Principles  which will be  sent to you.  womankind  STAFF  ASSOCIATE EDITOR  Mary Osborn  CONTRIBUTORS  Anonymous  Charlene Baldridge  Mary L.

In concert, her music flowed like a river: Libba steering the audience of primarily white women/feminists.  All of us floated magnificently until we hit the religious waters of her repertoire, where a powerful conflict occurred which remains with me still.

Libba asked her audience to sing  What a Friend We  Have in Jesus,    Do Lord,   and  In the Sweet Bye  and Bye,   there was a minor mutiny,  Libba asked the audience to re-visit her girlhood,  to experience her culture: and many educated women  dedicated feminists, were uncomfortably struck dumb.'  For a feminist, it may be politically imperfect to  sing these songs: a not-so-subtle propagation of patri.  archy.    However, to ignore or put down a woman  whose feminism is not as  educated , is a much  greater service to patriarchy: the discounting of  women by women.  Elizabeth Cotten traveled alone, missed a plane at  O'Hara Airport, caught a cold on a drafty communter  to sing for part of an evening in Bloomington, Indiana.  Libba sang for women from all over the United States.  Although they asked for an encore, they did not  want to hear or join in singing the religious songs  she chose.  Elizabeth Cotten is a woman who has lived over  eight decades.   A matriarch of three generations, she  still has the energy to share her gift of music with  strangers -- who aren't  strangers  to her.   I am not  a Christian, but I was very moved when Libba said-  she prayed for :  All my friends and fans.      Libba's  humanity  is not an ideological threat.  The arts teach us the breadth of our cultural understanding.  Lying at Jesus' Feet  hits a very discordant  place within me. But still, Elizabeth Cotten -- woman, the survivor -- sings songs/plays music beyond  those lyrics. The reality of her life, her music, her  magic all deserve more than any political criticisms  I might make.  I love you, Libba.   I was awed by your presence,  I was glad at your stories, and I was moved by your  music.   As your experience differs from me, I am  humbled with respect --if not precise empathy.  I wish I had more blossoms for you.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  3.   No matter how much women prefer to lean, to  be protected and supported, nor how much men  desire to have them do so, they (women) must  make the voyage of life alone, and for safety in  an emergency they must know something of the  laws of navigation. ...   ELIZABETH   CADY   STANTON  From an 1892 speech given to the House  Judiciary Committee  You've Got A Long Way To Go, Baby -  Thoughts About Women  59 Years After The Suffrage Amendment  by MARY  L.   BRANSON  Women as Portrayed   in Chinese  Calligraphy  pi  1 *  SUffMGE     IS  MUK  s  B  31  Mary L. Branson,  Director of Religious Education  at All Souls Unitarian Church in Indianapolis,  addresses the congregation.   The picture, poster,  and clipping display depict suffrage leaders of  the past,  including her mother: Olive Beldon  Lewis.   (Photo by J. LaFourest)  That phrase  you've come a long way, Baby,   is  of course, an advertising slogan suggesting that women have made great progress because now they have  the right to smoke cigarettes and get lung cancer- -  just like men.  Somehow, I don't think that is the kind of progress  our remarkably talented and dedicated foremothers,  including my own mother, fought so long and so  hard to achieve.   Nearly all these women believed  that the suffrage amendment would bring equality  and that women would take an active part in government.   My mother even believed that once women  gained the vote, they would do away with war   On August 26th 1980, we will celebrate the 60th  anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment,  which gave women the right to vote.   If we look at  the progress women made before that date in 1920,  we will have to agree that we have come a long way.  But we will agTee,  I am sure, that we still have a  long way to go to reach the millenium our foremothers  dreamed of   MALE ATTITUDES THROUGH THE AGES   I hate learned women,   ranted Hippolytus in the  5th century B. C. play by Euripedes, and his cry of  rage has echoed down the centuries.  When the poet William Cowper (1731-1800)  learned that a book he had highly praised was by a  woman, he could hardly contain his anger.  How  comes it to pass that she, being a woman, writes with  a force and energy and a correctness hitherto arrogated by the men?   The same righteous indignation was  expressed by the French Impressionist painter, Edgar  Degas (1834-1917) when he first admired the work of  Mary Cassatt:    I do not admit that a woman can paint  like that     Degas did overcome his initial prejudice  to become a good friend of Cassatt, and painted the  only portrait of her.  Fanny Mendelssohn, the sister of Felix, was a talented composer in her own right, but in deference to  her parents she did not publish her compositions;  Felix published them under his name.   It was not that  Felix  wanted to steal from her.   On the contrary, in  1842 when he was received by Queen Victoria in  Buckingham Palace and the Queen sang what she thought  was one of his songs, he was proud to reveal his sister  Fanny had written it.   But both Felix and Fanny agreed  with the convention that it was improper for a woman  to make a public display of her talent.  Continued to page 10  by ANNE  M.   COOPER   FU  WlFe  The character for  wife  consists of the symbol for  woman, the symbol for hand and, in the hand,  the symbol for broom.  One warm April evening in 1970,  I and thousands of  other people crowded into the Festival Plaza at Expo  '70 near Osaka, Japan,  and waited for the main event  of the evening.   Soon a slight woman in slacks entered  the arena;  children strained to see her, while their  parents peered through fancy cameras trying to get  her in focus.   The woman spread a piece of material  looking like a tablecloth in the center of the arena  floor, and then proceeded to dip a giant brush   about  the size of a broom--into a giant ink container that  looked like a wheelbarrow.   Handling the brush with  ease, she painted one giant character  (hana,  flower), on the tablecloth,  which was then hoisted  high up by wires amidst a great deal of clapping and  cheering.  The woman was Toko Shinoda, who is undoubtedly  Japan's most famous calligrapher-artist.   Miss Shinoda  started at the age of six to train rigorously in the 3, 500-  year-old art of calligraphy.   She first learned the basic  strokes of the kaisho (straight writing) style, later took  up the rounder and freer sosho (abbreviated writing)  style,  and eventually mastered the gyosho (grass-  writing) style, the freest and most abstract of all.  After many years of copying the works of the great  calligraphers of the past,  she realized that her own  letters ought to reflect her own personality,  moods,  and feelings, and the age in which she lived.   Today  she uses the traditional papers, brushes,  and inks, as  well as the ancient calligraphic forms, but she uses  them in such an original and personal way that she is  regarded as one of Japan's foremost abstract artists.  Calligraphy has been raised to an art in both China  and Japan,  and it takes years to be able to write passably in the  grass writing  style, much less to attain  a creative or individual style worthy of note.   I have  sampled these difficulties first hand during studies of  calligraphy in Tokyo*  During this close study of characters, I became increasingly interested in their derivations. What struck  me most was the variety of characters based  on the  symbol, for woman (t  ) and the dearth of characters  based on the symbol for man (i.e.,  male ).  I looked closely at the most commonly used characters using the symbol  woman  and made some interesting discoveries.  While we Westerners speak of spelling, the Chinese  and Japanese speak of stroke count and stroke order.  The character  woman,   for example, includes three  strokes.   Originally it probably represented a seated or  pregnant woman.  Relatively few Chinese characters simply picture one  thing or one idea, however.   Most are built of two or  more parts, called  radicals.    In some characters, all  the parts contribute to meaning.   In others, one part may  indicate meaning, while the second suggests pronunciation.   In still others, the same radical can contribute  both sound and meaning.  CHARACTERS in WHICH BOTH PARTS  INDICATE MEANING  Radicals  woman + child  woman + roof  woman + small, young  woman + render service  woman + birth  woman + youngest child  woman + broom  woman + support, setting  woman + old age  woman + retainer  woman + woman + woman  woman + rabbit  woman + somebody  woman + horse  woman + weakness  woman + household  woman + two shellfish  Meaning  like  peace  strange, delicate  concubine  surname  younger sister  wife  begin, open  old woman  princess  noise  bear children  go-between  mare  delicacy  to marry (a man)  baby  The character for  husband  consists of the symbol  for man, plus an additional line signifying high  status   perhaps originally a hat.  Some are creative (peace-woman under a roof),  some infuriating (woman+woman+woman noise),  but all are fascinating. (Space precludes us from  reproducing the calligraphy for all the characters  discussed here,  but the author can send reproductions of them to anyone interested.)  CHARACTERS in WHICH ONE or the OTHER  RADICAL CONTRIBUTES BOTH SOUND  AND MEANING  As above,  we find many unexpected combinations.  Radicals  woman + destroy  woman + mother  woman + old  woman + man in box  woman + younger sibling  woman + flatter  woman + do something for  woman + capture  woman + humble  woman + bright, prosperous  woman + dark  woman + older person  woman + disease  woman + rejoice  woman + house guest  woman + frost  Meaning  reckless  wet nurse  mother-in-law  marriage  younger sister  flirt, charm  pleasure  marry (a man)  maid servant  prostitute  marriage  elder brother's wife  jealous  glad  bride  widow  CHARACTERS with a  WOMAN  RADICAL for  the ONLY MEANING  In column a, the second radical indicates sound.   In  column b, the original pronunciation seems to have  changed, so that the sound radical doesn't serve its original function.  queen  go-between  courtesan  rudeness  beauty  mother  attractive  hinder  jealous  pregnant  graceful  girl  niece  elder sister  pregnancy  old woman  facial beauty  graceful  young girl  old woman  covet  dislike  woman, wife  princess  cajole  grandmother  beauty  young, work  These lists can tell us something about attitudes  towards women some 3, 500 years ago.   To try to  discern some attitude patterns,  I gave each character studied a  coded word.    One of these codes was   definition,   applied in cases such as   woman  +  horse mare  and woman + retainer (i.e., the vassal  of a shogun)  princess.     These simple definitions  formed the largest group of all (22 examples.)  Another code I used was  compliment  (for such  words as  peace,    graceful,   or  beauty ); this  group consisted of 14 examples.   Another group  labelled  derogation  included 11 words such as   wickedness ,   jealousy , and  hate '    Characters  having to do with reproduction accounted for 9 examples.   A group which could loosely be called  'Inferior status  included 4 graphs (concubine, weal;).  A group I termed  marriage  also contained 4 examples;  here there was some overlap, as a character for  wife   made up of a woman+ a broom was, for example, included  in both the  marriage  and  inferior status  groups.  The final small group was called  power over men   Continued to page 4

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Rebecca Pitts Honored  by IUPUI  Senior Honor  Society  Rebecca E. Pitts, Associate Professor Emeritus of  English at Indiana University-Purdue University at  Indianapolis, was honored at the annual Accolade  initiation ceremony.  During the evening ceremony, held on Friday,  May 9, 1980, it was announced that Professor Pitts  had been unanimously elected an honorary member  of the honor society.   This is the society's highest  award and is bestowed only upon a person who has  made a distinguished contribution to the university  and the community.  Accolade has also established the Rebecca E. Pitts  Scholarship fund.   This fund will be used to award  a scholarship each year to a senior high school  student from Marion County who has excelled in  the areas of scholarship, leadership,  and service  and who will be attending I. U. P. U. I. the following Fall Semester.  The first recipient of the Rebecca E. Pitts  Scholarship is Monica Brooks who recently graduated  from Arsenal Technical High School, the high  school from which Professor Pitts graduated in 1922.  Ms. Brooks maintained an  A  average during her  high school career and will enter I. U. P. U. I. in  the Fall, 1980.   she plans to major in engineering.  Articles and poems by Rebecca Pitts have been  published in WOMANKIND.   Ms. Pitts is a staunch  supporter of WOMANKIND and women's rights.  CHINESE...

Workshops, entertainment, and  a feminist fun fashion show for NOW members and  the public will be part of the week-end conference.  For further information concerning the conference or  on how to become a member of the Indiana National  Organization for Women, write or call: Marion  Wagner, 3530 Donald Avenue, Indianapolis, Indiana  46224 (317) 291-8671.  NOW is the organization that has fought and the one  that continues to fight for all women everywhere.

They  could be divided in other ways.  Whatever the scheme, the results show a varied,  often contradictory range of attitudes towards women,  from condescension to bewilderment to awe-- a  range which is both more complex than and quite  different from the attitudes towards men which a  similar character analysis would probably reveal.  Whether or not these attitudes approximate our  own in the West or those of other past or present Asian  cultures is a question which lies beyond the scope of  this article.  One wonders, whether any of the literati of ancient  time looked at their written language and found it  blatantly sexist, feeling that, for example,   jealous   ought not to be represented by  woman  +  disease   or  noise  by three women grouped together.   At any  rate, any attempts that might have been made at  prescription failed.  If English -speaking feminists succeed in desexifying  our tongue, our language will speak volumes about us  to future linguists.

(by Anne Cooper)  Women     Helping     Women  When I read the return address, I smiled.   Although I had never met Martha Esther Eubanks, I  felt close to her because of her beautiful poems  and articles in WOMANKIND.  Opening the letter, I picked up a woven cloth  bookmark which lay inside the stationery.    I burst  into tears as I read with my eyes blurred and my  body shaking with sobs. I could not read her letter  until I had blotted my eyes and had blown my nose  several times.   I asked myself why I was crying.  Surely it wasn't the rejected manuscript that had  also come in the mail.   I have received those before.  After I calmed down, I returned to Martha's card.  Dear Judi,  A dear little 76-year-old Canadienne sent  this card and bookmark for me to 'send to  someone who needs it.'   The donor is in a  wheelchair because of an auto accident many  years ago.   Her cheer and philosophy are a  great help to me   I've no way of knowing this,but I know you  hurt    and wish I could help you.   I know that  whatever your problem, it will resolve itself,  and soon.    You will have benefited through  the experience,  as will those around you. . .  because henceforth you will be more aware of  their needs and problems.   It's all a growing  process, you know.  I wish you a happy day, young Judi. A  happy life.  Sincerely,  Martha E.  Because she included her phone number at the  bottom of the page, I called her to affirm that I  did hurt and to thank her for lessening that hurt.  I pondered what had happened.   A woman in  Canada helped Martha who helped me.        a a tr- ' a  gt; v n sa r-,. u vrs.ar' w su a   * m  yxrr oku QC iSloj        * s    e.tfiLn    tlL J2ou  /l C/iojr lt;  ns   Z5G-/6 gt;2.      , 2nd.-p  .   4 ZC8  by JUDITH RAE  At a time when I felt unneeded and useless,  Martha's letter made me think about the women  I had recently touched.   First was a friend I'll call  Brenda, who is facing the probability of divorce  with no training,  education,  or experience in  earning a living.   I had helped Brenda by listening to her fears, her uncertainties, her confusion.  Then I had telephoned a woman I had not talked  to for about nine months. As we talked, I soon  realized that June had needed that phone call from  me. Admitting she had no other friend with whom  she could open up, she thanked me enthusiastically  for encouraging her to telephone - even at 2 A, M.  --if she felt the need to talk to someone.  Yesterday two women revealed their pain to me:  Phyllis told me of her conflicting feelings about a man  who wanted to marry her.   Having been divorced for  less than a year, she felt ill-prepared for such a relationship even though she cares very much for him.  The other woman, a student of mine, told me of her  difficulty in  maintaining relationships with men. The  young men her age want a sex partner, and her parents  object to the older men with whom she feels more  comfortable.  No, I didn't solve any problems for these women,  but I listened to their concerns, their fears, their  hopes, their resentment, their anger.   Though I had  no magic wand to wave away their troubles, I offered  them love and friendship - which is what Martha and  the Canadian woman gave to me.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  5.  Sister in Walnut Canyon  You and I  halfway down the canyon- -  no visitors today at 110    Great crevasse of silence.  The same lone hawk screeches  noontime that screeched it     I   centuries ago against your sun  and the same great ledge casts shade.  Here walls were built,  here your handprint in the old cement.  Did I pat daubings too,  leave a handprint in the cool, wet clay?  Girls together collecting yucca,  fetching water  from the stream in the greening  three hundred feet below.  What tales were we told?  What were our fears?  Whom did we love?  What did I have to know?  The silence:  maybe that's why I'm back,  maybe that's why you came along  to what I can't explain: the ragged  out-there that keeps me searching  for this place  while you remember the years  of thin corn and that unending climb.  by joan Mcintosh  The     Married    Grandmother  I smile and  fear for that  Sheltered woman,  married to her house  Resentful--with good reason--of the  jailor who put her across this threshold.  Ah, the pattern of her life;  The jobs that stay unfinished  to give her purpose.  All that I pity,  All that I will fight to be free from--  Though she is lost.  I am thankful that I am not neurotic,  That my own insanity is serious.  Still,  I cannot explain my washing the dishes  at midnight  Just so they won't laugh in my face  the next day.  VERSE  Penetrating a Prison  During Visiting Hours  She lives within the veiled confinement of a nun.  Suburbia  has wrapped itself around her neck  like a rosary,  Pain is disguised  by soap opera apologies,  while her body has been consumed  in the matrimonial bed.  There are no more chalices or consecrations  offered to her.  Benedictions  leave a bad taste  and  the fires have burnt out  from behind her eyes.  by   SANDRA KAY HAUSFELD  Untitled  she sings old songs  can sing them  and jazz, the lazy and complicated ribbons  chorded about her beating throat  humming as gold and endearing  as the verse  so taken with her  suddenly sure of her ending  like all songs  I secretly labor to make her matter less  by L.A. SMITH  Theater  This theater is too large    too dark    for surgery  but the great still crowd    no doubt   has much to lose  and will never contemplate this frozen moment  as if it were merely another performance  of one more play  under the fierce lights down there  the men in green masks must be surgeons  but why is the knife arrested?  why is it all so crucial and uncertain?  who is the covered quiet figure on that table?  and are the surgeons friendly?  This is     the structure of vision  of poetry and nightmare  in itself arrested      meaningless     empty  waiting to be completed  by anyone in the audience  or by every reader  each one      an unfinished  interpretation  of the same invisible text  by  REBECCA E.   PITTS  yet as basic as music  she pulses  a dear lyric  by CAROLE  WALSH  Hartwick  Cleaning  Woman  Of Course, I Have a Headache   From the infinite places of intimate space,  Lips locked to lips, bodies glued in embrace,  We're brought down from the heights of amorous passion  By the mundane sameness of connubial fashion.  A legal bordello,  is wedlock, these days;  Check in, get your beds, get fed, get your lays,  Back the cars from the drives and go on your ways      (I feel like a mouse that's caught in a maze,  Where every path leads to a range or a bed  And I'll never get out 'til I keel over dead.)  I hope other young women will learn from this rhyme:  And why didn't somebody tell me in time?  by MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  Dear lady,  Dear lady,  We seem to have arrived  Long before the gentlemen received the invitations.  We seem to have  become   Long before the gentlemen were made aware that  becoming  Was in style.  And you and I dear sister  Seem to have loved a much greater, endless ocean  Far beyond the pond in which the gentlemen now  swim.  We have traveled entire continents  In search of very definite longings  All the while searching within our selves.  And the gentlemen pat fat bellies  And wonder what will be the next frontier.  by MARY MC DANIEL  Firecrackers bursting firesounds outside  While inside my soul  My breath is fire.  The day is crushing me to crawl  on my knees  To beg my life for mercy.  This night of independence is cool to the touch  But the fire to the mind and soul.  Hot tortuous flames devour my mind,  until not even a phoenix,  can rise,  From these dead ashes.  bY   ANNIE  MAYROSE  A Trial Re-enacted  - One Question  If the God-Man  sisters aj  can you hear  my trembling voice  of forget-me-not blue  my tongue's being stitched  to my gums  my green uniform hangs  upon the campus stairs  across the railing  burnished with my pain  plants of delicate longing  hold me captive  each day their gentle mouths  grow more demanding sucking  like chlorophyll piglets at the breast  the carpet kidnaps me  passing me along from brown square to black  on these fibers  your footsteps strike my pavlovian nell  another vacuuming  another vacuuming  had been a  God-Woman  Would the Scriptures have related  The Raping  rather than the  Scourging???  by  SANDRA KAY HAUSFELD  Senses  Notes gathered tuneless in  a hollow place  Sense a kiss on lips  too numb to know  Echo of the piper  playing me to sleep  you're feminist writers i'm told  unaware you file past me  i too am a woman  liberate me  liberate my first breath  and plant sunflowers in this mouth where  forget-me-nots once grew  by BONNIE   MC CORMACK  by  ANONYMOUS  Poetry  Poetry is that neurosis of the week  Whose working out on paper  Keeps me semblance-sane  by CHARLENE BALDRIDGE

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Thoughts of a Reluctant Housewife  by PAT HEIDENREICH  I've always wanted to hang a sign in our house  that read,  If you think THIS is bad... you should've  see it before I cleaned.    When I think that a  woman's house is a reflection of her... I get almost  depressed enough to be motivated.   In fact, often,  as I lay on the couch and watch the little dancing  specks of light on the wall caused by the disintegrating drapery linings... I think about house cleaning.  Fortunately, I'm good at rationalizing.  If I cleaned, I'd deprive the kids of watching the  spider's aerial act in the corner of the kitchen ceiling.  And then the poor dears would have nothing to do during breakfast, except fight.   And that would make a  boring, monotonous day for them, since fighting is  what they do from breakfast on.  I reach for a bon bon and console myself with the  thought.. . at least our house looks lived in... (the  understatement of the year)... at least I don't have  one of those showplace homes, that stifle a child's  natural tendencies... (Oh would that it were so).  From my vantage point on the couch, I contemplate  all the years of careless living it took to make those  extra designs on the living room funiture --  like  that big chair. .. I remember how contented the cat  was as she shredded the fabric.  Besides, I think to myself, not many visitors realize  that the arrangement of the furniture is dependent on  the latest and darkest stains on the carpet.   The footstool does look a little weird, though, sitting in  the middle of the room, six feet away from any  chair.  Lucky for me I discovered how to entertain, under  the circumstances.   Using only one candle for light  makes the joint look pretty good.   Of course, the  guests do have a tendency to fall over the footstool  as they grope their way around.  And another thing... (I think, as I stretch out,  put my arms behind my head, and look at the  ceiling)... If 1 DID clean good, I'd be erasing  many happy memories of last summer.   Like the  results up there of the funny joke the kids played  on Dad by shaking up his can of beer. . . And over  there, on the wall, where the most gigantic fly was  slaughtered with a fancy under-the-leg swing of  the swatter.  Anyway, (I think, as I reach for the June Redbook)  it would be kind of dumb to clean now, since spring  house-cleaning time has again passed me by. (I try  to mentally disregard that the past four springs have  also slipped by somehow with no time for cleaning.  Turning on my side I note the woodwork... it  would be a shame to wash away all those little  baby handprints.   His hand will never be that  small again.  I pop another bon bon and flop over on my back.  I guess I really should try harder to instill some  respect for home furnishings into the kids.   But  how? ... no, that's out.   I'd get sent up for life.  Besides, it's tiring to always be shouting,   Watch that glass of milk on the arm of the chair   ... I've told you a thousand times that under the  couch is not the place for coke cans, candy wrappers, and apple cores... Get back into the kitchen  with that peanut butter... if I find one more wad of  gum on the floor, I'll go crazy    Especially  when the usual reply is,  picky, picky, picky    So, I've decided to accept frustration and enjoy  life.   After all, one day I'll be standing in the  middle of my spotless empty house, mumbling   Where is everybody?   As Indianapolis News  columnist Myrtie Barker points out in her book by  that title:  a time will come to all of us, a lonesome time, when even a smudge of peanut butter  on the best chair would be welcomed, if it brought  our grown children home to us.   These busy, hectic  days will soon enough become cherished memories,  warming an old woman's lonesome heart.   Well,  lay it on me    I'm ready  I'll just wait for  memory time  to clean.

SPINSTERS, INK.   1979.    4.50 paperback  Rich vocabulary.   Vivid descriptions.   Stirring  dramatic scenes.   Lively character sketches.  Maureen Brady's GIVE ME YOUR GOOD EAR contains all of these components.   So why was this  artistically written novel rejected by countless  publishers, agents, and the few small feminist  presses before the author and another woman finally  founded their own press, and published the book  themselves.  This question is answered in detail in a seven-  page afterword by Jacqueline St. Joan.   The reader,  feeling the intensity and satisfaction of having completed the reading of this moving book, experiences  indignation that such quality writing can be ignored   rejected, discounted, and discouraged by the predominately male-centered, patriarchal publishing  world.  GIVE ME YOUR GOOD EAR explores relationships:  sorrow, hate, violence, sexual feelings, childhood  memories, and more.  Maureen Brady, a physical therapist and physical  therapy instructor at Russell Sage College, realistically communicates the fears, disillusions, hopes,  and strengths of the various women in her novel:  Francie (the main character), Francie's mother and  grandmother, her neighbor Ethel and her friend Lisa,  an old woman hitchhiking in Ireland and a fifteen  year old brain tumor patient.  How many other rejected manuscripts, written by  feminists, will remain unpublished because they do  not fit the standard mold for a financially successful  book?  What can we do to make sure these books are  made available to readers?  How can we encourage  women and men to read books such as GIVE ME YOUR  GOOD EAR?   Violence; daily work; female connections . . .  perceived through a woman's eye. The integrity of  Brady's writing never falters.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  What Do I/We Want?  by  MARTHA  SMITH  L fare yw -poe rv tfu  TrceA   by  BEVERLY SILVA  What do women want?  This question stumped  Sigmund Freud who supposedly knew what you wanted  even when you really didn't know yourself.  And, what do I want?  I was brought up with the idea that Dad would  bring home the bacon and Mom would cook it. My  childhood seemed sensible, and it was the only way  I knew.   But now that I have only one year of high  school left between me and my future, I need to  make some important decisions.  Diamonds are sprouting like warts from my friends'  fingers.   My mother's friends are clucking across their  card tables:    Haven't you found someone yet?...  When the right man comes along, you'll forget this  architecture nonsense... No one will love you when  you have a Ph. D Successful women aren't happy.    Their dark warnings have sapped the bulk of my  ambitions.  Women are looked upon as sex objects; a prime  example is the American beauty pageants. Girls in  short skirts twirl batons, sing songs, and perform skits.  This format hardly allows a female chemical engineer to demonstrate her genius.   A contest like  this reinforces the notion that women are not judged  on what they contribute to society, but on how  attractive they appear to men.  Husbands usually aren't into housework.   We say  that husbands  help around the house.     We don't say  that wives help around the house.   A woman who does  housework is doing her job.   Her husband is a good guy  for pitching in, but it isn't really considered his responsibility. When there is a female president of the  United States, will the nation expect her to keep the  White House clean?  When Susan B. Anthony was a young girl in Massachusetts, she asked her teacher why he taught long division only to the boys.   His answer was,   A girl needs  to know how to read her Bible and count her egg money,  nothing more.   In 1888, Elizabeth Cady Stanton said:  the younger  women are starting with great advantages over us.  They have the results of our experience, they have  superior opportunities of education, they will have  more courage to take the rights which belong to  them. . . thus far the women have been the mere  echoes of man.. . the true woman is yet the dream of  the future.  That time and that dream are here today with the  proposed Equal Rights Amendment  So what do I/we want?  I want  the rights which belong to   me--we want   the dream of the future.

 the birds that perch in the tree over our balcony    the cool air that filters through the sliding door  screens   the early sun.   they tell me life is still o.k.    i only had a bad dream.  i made coffee   noticed the mushrooms had gone bad so  i cleaned the refrigerator,   then i went outside to pick  flowers   placed them around the apartment,   this act  has become a ritual this year,   as if the flowers could  save us.   it was too late for breakfast,   we had an  appointment at nine,   joy had agreed to see a counselor  to please me.   i'm not really a mother, we've been  apart too much with all these divorce problems   no  relatives to turn to.   so i phone counselors when i have  trouble.   i wish joy had sick tonsils again   called me  with her bell   pleading eyes,   i wish a truck would hit  her   we could rush to emergency hospital,   if i take her  temperature perhaps i'll find a fever,   but we reached  the counselor's office   we sat in comfortable brown  overstuffed chairs,   the counselor is a feminist   she  wore a cool blue dress almost like a morning robe    she served us coffee.  i knew but i listen with a third party present while joy  says how sick   tired of the whole mess she is   she  wants to split on friday.   she also says how unfair i am  about her friends   that they are only tough because of  how they were raised but they are really the nicest people  in the world   johnny only ripped off a peterbilt so he  could get started in a good business,   if he hadn't got  caught everything would be o.k.   i am also damn unfair  about his getting evicted from his apartment,   the only  reason he didn't pay his rent was because the manager  refused to fix his dishwasher.     the guys in   out of  his apartment were his truckdriver friends who needed a  place to stay,   the neighbors weren't very nice to complain, either,   maryann is his sister   she's 18   really  has her head together,   there's nothing wrong with her  living with a 33 year old man   she plans to finish school  someday,   in fact, just last night they were talking about  how they could take night classes together next year,  bobino doesn't want her to work or go to school now because of the jewelry business he's starting .   he's really  rich   the only reason they all live in a one bedroom  apartment on third street is because it's close to contacts,  they plan to move later   if johnny gets sent up maryann  and bobino still want her to stay with them,   wait six  months   just see how happy   well off she will be, she  finishes.  my turn   i felt the counselor probing my identity,   her  blue eyes wash away the poet   the student,   i  fight  with this mother thing,   understanding mother/part-time  mother/just want your own way mother/clinging mother/  jellyfish mother,   i sop up a box of the counselor's  kleenex.   my words do not defend me. i know i'm wrong,  i know i'm beaten,   i know i'm unrealistic,   i just  thought a talk she could she might i hoped maybe change  her mind see things differently wait awhile,   i paid the  small sliding scale fee   we left.  i yearn to be so rich i can whisk her off to europe. i  yearn to be so powerful i can have her put away in a  convent.  we stopped at Herfy's   had a hamburger   french fries  for the breakfast we had missed,  way out on 13th street i found used tires for  7. 95   if  they don't pass inspection i can return them, funny, not  caring about risking my life on those tires, but knowing  i must not lose my insurance.  three letters were in the mailbox when we returned  home,   the women's therapy center sent a brochure of  activities,   my grade card all a's   a gpa of 3.45. as  if it could matter,   the unexpected insurance premium  increase,   another crisis,   i mentally add   re-add my  total worth,   less than  100 in the bank    40 a week  unemployment.  joy intends to leave friday.  i worry about the plants,   i'm too tired to cook the brown  rice   besides i'll have to move,   the dishes must be  packed,   i think maybe i'm dreaming but the neighbors  below are laughing   drinking beer   they seem very  real,   joy is asleep on the sofa,   i want to cover her  with a blanket even in this June heat,   i want to shove  pills down her throat   sit penitent by her side waiting  for a change,   but it's time for my writing class   i'd  hate myself if i became a devouring mother like all the  stereotyped women depicted in 20th century  modern literature by male authors  so i let her go    i go to class  but  i have no poem  this week.  7461 W. 10th Street  Indianapolis, Indiana 46224  m  Residential  Commercial  Farms  HOMES  BOBBIE BOSE  A Feminist Realtor  Office 271-5555  Residence 244-4876  WA  Rescue  me  from  this car   Did you know   The heat in this car can destroy  my heart and lungs, and 1 can die within twenty  minutes.

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  LONG WAY... Cont. from page 3  Margaret Fuller, a brilliant early Unitarian writer,  noted in 1845 that whenever a woman gave evidence  of creative genius it was said of her,  she has a masculine mind.    EARLY SHEDS  In 1792  Mary Wollstonecraft wrote The Vindication  of the Rights of Women which herstorically marks the  recorded beginning of the struggle for women's rights.  The book was a direct reflection of Mary Wollstone -  craft's sympathies with the French and American  revolutions, a demand that women's rights be included  in the rights of men for which the revolutionaries were  fighting.  Earlier, during the American Colonial period (1607-  1753), women could vote, and many did, since the  right to vote was based upon the ownership of property, not sex. Also, women were the majority of workers in the first U.S. major industry--the spinning and  weaving of cotton, and they were prominent in the  early labor struggles.  THE ASOLITIONISTS  The women's rights movement sprung directly from  the abolitionist movement.   Every prominent fighter  for women's rights was first an abolitionist; and the  two movements were closely allied for 50 years.  There is a simple explanation for this evolution of  women's rights from the slavery issue - women who  started out to plead for the slave found they were  not allowed to speak    They were ridiculed when  they appeared on a speaker's platform, and not  accepted as delegates when they attended anti-  slavery conventions.   Much of this opposition came  from the clergy quoting the Bible and God's will as  their authority.   The clergy was a much stronger influence on public opinion than they are today.  While women were risking their lives feeding and  clothing slaves on their way to Canada, many clergymen huddled in churches wringing their hands and forecasting the doom of the American home. ('The same  old argument is often used by those who oppose the  Equal Rights Amendment.)  Within a short time, most of the women prominent  in the abolitionist movement spoke up for their own  rights, too.   And, many of the foremost speakers for  women's causes were men: such as William Lloyd  Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Frederic Douglas (who was  a former slave), Henry Ward Beecher, and Ralph  Waldo Emerson, a famous Unitarian minister.   These  men were attacked even more visciously than the  women, and labelled  hermaphrodites  and  Aunt  Nancy Men,   a term referring to no particular woman, (used as  Uncle Tom  is todays but meaning  half-man and half-woman.  Many of the women in the early days of the  movement advocated other reforms such as  socialism, atheism, temperance, trade unions,  birth control, free love, and easier divorce laws.  Since these causes were not too popular at the beginning of the 1800's, this helps to explain why  these women were considered freaks without morals.  But, it is not true that the early feminists were either  libertines or embittered virgins.   With the exception  of Susan B. Anthony, the best known feminists:  Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone,  and Carrie Chapman Catt seemed to be happily  married.   Mrs. Mott and Mrs. Stanton, founders of  the movement, were also mothers of large families.  Lucretia Mott was a Quaker.   In the Quaker church,  women not only had an equal voice in church management, but could also speak wi th equal authority as  ministers.   Girls were given the same education as  boys; however, women teachers in Quaker schools  weie paid only half as much as men teachers, although tuition for girls was the same as for boys.  A sense of outrage at this economic injustice  started Lucretia, then a 16 year-old teacher, on  her lifetime battle for equality.   Of unusual intellect  and breadth of vision, Lucretia became a Quaker  minister and was an active lecturer and organizer for  50 years.   She also raised six children, and apparently enjoyed domestic activities like cooking and sewing.  Lucretia attended the first organizational meeting  of the first anti-slavery group in Philadelphia in  1833.   Although she spoke several times during the  convention, she and other women who were present  were not  invited  to sign the declaration that was  adopted.   Lucretia promptly formed the Women's  Anti-Slavery Society.   This brazen deed was  attacked by clergymen as an act of sedition against  God   In 1840, a world-wide anti-slavery convention was  called in London, and the American Anti-Slavery  Society elected Lucretia Mott and two other women  along with Charles Redmond, a Black man, as delegates.   Another delegation which was 100 percent  male, was sent by a newly-formed anti-slavery group  opposed to the women's participation.   In London,  every effort was made to persuade the women delegates to withhold their credentials, but Lucretia insisted that the responsibility for official rejection  must rest with the convention.   Her plan failed; the  reactionaries won, -- women were admitted, but as  guests.   And they were seated behind a curtain which  screened them from public gaze.  William Lloyd Garrison, perhaps the greatest orator  in the Abolitionist Movement, was scheduled to be the  main speaker.   On his arrival, he climbed the steps to  the women's balcony and sat in silent protest beside  Lucretia.   He remained there during the convention.  It was on this trip to England that Lucretia Mott  met Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a bride on her honeymoon.   Her husband was a delegate.   She and Lucretia were thoroughly indignant over the humiliating injustice done to the women.   Then and there,  they decided to start a crusade for women's rights as  soon as they returned to America.   However, it took  eight years after they returned before they were able  to carry out their plans and call the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848.  SENECA FALLS  The Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 was advertised as open to women only.   When the women  arrived at the Unitarian church where they were to  meet, they found they were locked out.   A young  professor climbed through a window and opened a  door for them,  and they decided to admit men oh  the spot.  Sixty-eight women and 32 men signed and  adopted a Declaration of Women's Rights based on  the Declaration of Independence which called for  complete equality in marriage, equal rights in  property, wages, and custody of children, the right  to make contracts, to sue and be sued, to testify in  court   and to vote. Over 300 women and men attended  the convention.  The suffrage amendment was introduced by  Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and at first Lucretia  Mott opposed it as  too radical,   but Frederick  Douglass, the freed slave, seconded Mrs. Stanton's  motion with one of the most eloquent speeches in  history for women's equality and the right to vote.  His speech inspired the women to pass the suffrage  amendment and make it their chief thrust.  As a young girl, Elizabeth Cady had seen women  coming into her father's law office to plead for help  from unjust laws.  The young law students clerking  in the office amused themselves reading her the  worst laws they could find.   Young Elizabeth marked  them, thinking they pertained only to her father's  practice, and she intended to  get rid of those laws   by cutting them out of the books.   Her father explained to her that the laws belonged to the whole  state, and could be altered only by the legislature.  This early knowledge of unjust laws, especially concerning women, prepared her for the battis that was to last  her and others like her for the rest of their lives.

At Lexington,  as featured writers/speakers were  Tillie Olsen, Audre Lorde, Leslie Ullman, Leslie  Marmon Silko, Sylvia Wilkinson, Nina Baym,  Angela Jackson, and Jessica Hagedorn.  Events included readings, panel discussions, workshops, and a luncheon.   The conference was free  and open to the public. Over one hundred persons  gathered for the first conference event: Sylvia Wilkinson's afternoon reading.   Approximately three  hundred filled an auditorium to hear Tillie Olsen  that evening.   Overall, attendance at the six readings ranged from about sixty people to about three  hundred,  attendance at the panel discussions and  lectures ranged from about seventy-five to one  hundred, and attendance at the writing workshops  averaged about fifty.  Hundreds of people attended the conference, and  the quality of the audiences (and,    the quality of their experiences) was exceptional.   The  questions and comments during frequent exchanges  among writers and audiences were interesting and  sometimes profound.   There were also sometimes  deeply felt differences of opinion.   In general,  the conference was characterized by intensity and  an atmosphere of mutual consideration and car-  People attended from various Kentucky communities and surrounding states (Ohio, Indiana, West  Virginia, North Carolina, Virginia).  Plans are being made for a third conference  (April, 1981), featuring a weekday/weekend  schedule to try to fit the needs of both students  and working people and people living outside the  immediate area; longer residences for one or  more writers; information on publishers and publishing; a writing contest; childcare; transportation  for the elderly; and much more.   The basic concept  of the conference   a gathering of writers and  readers, with a focus on the outlook and contribution of the woman writer   will remain the same.

Asked that the United Methodists Conference gen-  eral agencies meet in states which have ratified and  if they must meet in states which have not, they are  encouraged to work toward ratification during those  meetings in unratified states.  Authorized preliminary study for a new hymnal  with special attention given to oppressive imagery  related to racism, sexism and ageism.  Decided to provide the United Methodist Publishing  House with a set of guidelines for ridding present materials of racist, sexist, and ageist imagery.  Authorized implementation of a major emphasis  on women's    history* in the United Methodist Church.  A total of approximately 3, 000 to 4, 500 attended  the ten day session at various times.   The United  Methodist Church has a very active and vocal women's  caucus who usually project the feminist viewpoint.  Women in Public Office  FEDERAL  JUDICIARY  NO WOMAN has ever served on the  U. S. Supreme Court. There are four  women Court of Appeals judges out of  97; and 14 women district court judges  our of 417.

Box 40904  San Francisco, California 94140  I  Final Option Necessary  by ROBERTA  LYNCH  A socially-enforced silence provides much of the  basis for the anti-abortion movement.   Abortion may  have come out of the back alleys in the eyes of the law,  but it remains in the back alleys of our society's consciousness.  Abortion is a religious sin for some and a social stigma  for many more.   It is a skeleton buried in family closets  as diligently as alcoholism or child abuse.   And, in  many cases, it is a trauma buried in a woman's life  that feeds on personal guilt and public disapproval.  One central reason for this state of affairs is that  abortion   unlike almost any other current political  issue   is inextribly linked to sexuality.   And, all  polls and pundits to the contraty, we remain a nation  mired in confusion about our sexual mores.  In certain very fundamental respects, sex is still  seen by many people as illicit pleasure.    And mere  is a price to be paid for such pleasure   the fear of  pregnancy for many or unwanted pregnancies for  some.   In this view, children become not so much  desirable and welcome  new additions,   but represent  punishment--the ultimate price paid for questionable  conduct.  This ambivalence about the nature of sexuality is  exhibited clearly in the anti-abortion movement's  approach to birth control.   Surely a movement that  genuinely wanted to limit the number of abortions  should  want to make one of its primary concerns the  prevention of pregnancies in the first place.  Yet in reality, the anti-choice forces have placed  almost no emphasis on sex education and contraceptive dissemination.    And, in fact, many of their  adherents have actively opposed such measures.  This attempt to make procreation the determinate  of sexuality is reinforced by a small but growing -  number of avowed progressive people.   They claim  to oppose the legalization of abortion on the grounds  that it contributes to governmental policies of population control.  On the whole this borders on political lunacy and  it essentially attempts to remove from the hands of  an individual woman the question of whether she  should bear a child.  None of this is to deny that there are real--and  weighty-- issues involved in the decision to have an  abortion.   It is a choice that few women make *  casually and that many make with real pain.  And there is no doubt that it is a course of action  that could be seriously reduced if we lived in a  society that guaranteed all of its members a decent  standard of living and that guaranteed women not  simply formal rights, but the material conditions  needed for full social participation.  WE'RE ALL FROM  AN UNRATIFIED  However, in the best of circumstances abortion will  remain necessary as a final option.   And the controversy  around it is unlikely to ever completely disappear.  There is now--and will no doubt continue to be     substantial scientific, religious, and ethical confusion over when a human life actually comes into  existence.  The various views provide the basis for ongoing debate, for the active dissemination of information, even  for social movements.   But they do not  provide any  reasonable basis for a political or legal judgment on  the matter.   Like many other important ethical questions in a genuinely free society, the question of abortion must be left up to the individual.  No woman should be forced to have an abortion because of poverty or the lack of child care or governmental pressure   as may now often be the case.   But  no woman should ever be forced to have a child because the only alternative is criminal and dangerous  --a medical hack or a coat hanger.  It is this view that needs to be more forcefully  expressed today.   The right wing continues to expand its influence and raise its issues through the  anti-abortion movement.   Yet even in the face of  its growing impact, many progressive people fail to  speak out in support of individual Freedom.  We cannot afford this silence any longer.   Women  cannot afford the real threat to the existence of this  basic right.   And the progressive movements cannot  afford to allow the right wing to occupy unchallenged  the terrain of personal life and human sexuality.  In the long run we need a political program that  addresses the issue of abortion in the context of defining new and more meaningful roles for women,  of examining the state of the family and child raising and of projecting a humane and liberating concept of  sexuality.  Most immediately we need a more active and  visible opposition to the anti-abortion forces.   And  we need the kind of grass-roots educational work  that can provide a growing base for such efforts.  We need to insist on our right to debate, to confront, to educate about and agonize over this decision, but   in the end   to make our own choices  about our own lives.

It was the article The First Five Years are the  Hardest.. .by Laurel Speer that did it. It's been a long  time since anything gripped me the way that story did.  I read it three times.

Somewhere in the past  year I have lost track of WOMANKIND and you of me.

In May of 1977, I was admitted to St. Mary's  Hospital in Evansville for what my gynecologist,  Dr. S., claimed to be a  chronic pelvic  inflammatory disease and a large mass on my uterus.    He had advised me I was in immediate need of a  complete hysterectomy.   I complied and admitted  myself into the hospital.   One hour before surgery, I  by CAROL ANN WILDS,  0624  Indianapolis, IN  was already shaved and prepped for the operation  when the hospital decided to conduct a routine  pregnancy test.   At that time, I discovered I was  pregnant.   The  large mass  was my child.   I  returned home with my husband, Gary Wilds, and  began making plans for the coming of my first  child.  I was 22 years old; I loved my husband even though  he had used me before and during our marriage to earn  money for him as a prostitute. I thought the baby would  now change all that.  My husband was 36 years old and I was his 5th  wife.   Gary was short tempered and prone to much  violence during the course of one of his drunks.  August 18, 1977 began as any other day that had  been occurring more and more since the discovery  of my condition.   He was up drinking and ready to  fight and we did.   We spent the day in arguments.  That evening I made up my mind to get out.  My stepdaughter drove me to a motel and after  CONTINUED to Page 3  BY WOMEN, ABOUT WOMEN, and FOR ALL WOMEN

On the Road for Women  From October 1981 to October 1982, Mary Clare  Powell and Anne Cheatham will travel the United  States in a van, looking for women who are conceiving or creating new structures for business, education, health care, law, the arts, banking, resource  use, etc   any facet of the culture.  Cheatham will interview women and write about  them, and create a network of them for their mutual  support. Cheatham believes that the future, if there  is one, is coming out of a feminine consciousness:  cooperative, non-hierarchical, holistic, life-giving.  A book collected from this year's data will be called  THE FUTURE IS FEMALE.  Mary Clare will be looking for feminist artists and  she too will seek to create a network of them.   She is  looking for women who create consciously as women,  and for whom, as feminists, social transformation is  a concern in their work.   Clare will carry a portable  display of feminist art from the Washington, DC area  which she will display in women's centers, art centers,  etc.  Both women are collecting names and addresses of  women to contact.   If you have names, please contact  them at 8002 Eiff Drive, Dunn Loring, Va 22027 or  (703) 560-3088 (evening), or Anne at work (202)225-3153  before Sept. 1, 1981.

Dumb Remark: Perfect Retort  Phyliss Schlafly's (dumb) remark:  Virtuous women  will never be victims of sexual harrassment on the  job or otherwise,   is backwards (as her statements  usually are) says the Rhetta Rique column in the  COLUMBUS FREE PRESS, May/June 1981.   It's virtuous men who will never sexually  harass women,   says Rhetta.  Editor's additions: (   ) and .

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  CONTINUED from Page 1  Prisoner tells her story  spending several hours there, I decided I was going  to leave him for good.   I was wearing a maternity  top and a pair of shorts.   I had  12 in my purse.   I  called the house, he was not home.   I took a cab  from the motel back to the house to get some  clothes and the checkbook and as I was packing  he came in.   He began striking me.   He hit me in  my abdomen and I told him to stop for he was  going to hurt the baby.   He said,   fuck that baby --  I'll kill that baby, too.    The fight ended with my  shooting him six times.   Pleading Not Guilty by  Reason of Self Defense, I went to jury trial on a  first degree murder charge.   I was convicted of  second degree murder and sentenced to 15 to 25  years in prison.  On November 19, 1977, I gave birth to my first  child, a daughter, while in custody of the Indiana  Department of Corrections.   I began doing my time.  The rest of the year passed somehow.   In 1978 my  interest in the struggle of prisoners'rights began.   I  filed numerous complaints concerning the operation  of the Women's Prison.   I was locked up a great deal  of the time on disciplinary actions  that were no more  than petty harassment.   Then a light began to shine.  He wore a blue uniform and he began providing me  with information that was helpful to the struggle.   He  also began making sexual advances.   His name was  Mr. A. and he was a correctional officer.   He was  also at that time acting chairman of the conduct  adjustment board, I complied with his sexual  advances, and many of my write-ups were then  either totally dismissed, or they were reduced to a  lesser charge, or I was given light disciplinary  sanctions.   Then the light got brighter, and the  network of prison corruption began to appear.  I met another man, Mr. B., a correctional  officer on the night shift.   At the time, he was  living with two of the female correctional officers  employed in this institution.   Mr. B. and  company   were heavy marijuana users and marijuana was  provided to me on a regular basis - as well as  liberties, freedoms, and things of that nature plus  food, small gifts, etc. that were not being provided  to the general prison population.  One evening I was in my room and a female  officer came to my door and advised me to go to  Center Hall.   The rest of the inmates were sleeping.  I left my room and upon arriving Center Hall was  empty.   I was a bit confused and still half asleep.  The counselor's office was right next door to the  officer's desk in Center Hall.   The door was open  and Mr. B. was there.   The officer came down the  hall and told me to go in, I did.   There were two  chairs.   Mr. B took one and the officer took the  other.   He then advised me to sit on his lap.   The  lights were off.   We were  going to smoke a  joint   We did. Then we finished three joints and the  officer left the room, at which point, Mr. B and  myself had sexual intercourse on the floor of the  counselor's office.   Near dawn, I was put back in  my room.  At one point I discovered that the superintendent's secretary, Ms. C., was living in the same  household with Mr. B. and two other correctional  officers.   I began to give a great deal of thought  as well as concern to the number of documents  that passed through the Superintendent's office  concerning myself and my sentence.   I took a  rapid evaluation of my situation.   It would be wise  to comply   Ms. C. is still the Superintendent's secretary  and the two female officers are still employed in  this institution.  For close to two years, the affairs with Mr. B.  and Mr. A. continued.   I provided oral sex on  stairways.   I followed instructions to clean the  entrance of my cottage in the early morning  wearing no more than a state dress without panties  so that it might make it more  convenient.    I  was ever constantly reminded that I was one of the   chosen  and I was doing my time.  Around July of 1979, the institution placed both  Mr. A. and Mr. B. on the same shift and I was  totally unable to deal with the pressure that followed.  I applied for a transfer to Westville Correctional  Center.   I was concerned that the transfer would not  be granted since I had not been on the prison  grounds long enough.   State law states that any one  convicted of murder or a class A felony must serve  the first two years of their confinement in maximum  security.   I was a couple of months shy of meeting  the statute guidelines.   Still, my transfer went  through and I was sent to Westville.  When I arrived I was placed in a dorm area to  live.   More and more women were moved into the  dorm and we got quite crowded.   At one point I  measured the distance between the beds and they  averaged 10-1/2 inches apart.   I filed a complaint.  No response.   I then wrote a letter to the department  of corrections describing the living area and sent the  letter to the Governor's office hoping the Ombudsman  would intervene and do something about the crowded  conditions.   I received no response.   In the letter, I  said that this complaint would be the last I would  file to the department about the overcrowded  conditions because they did not want to correct the  problems, or so it appeared.  I took a job to get away from the dorm.   I worked  on an outside detail.   I met a man.   His name was  Mr. D.   He introduced himself and asked if I would  like to work for him.   I said yes.   I later learned he  was the physical plant director and a good friend of  the Superintendent's.   Mr. D. offered me the best  job in the entire prison system for a woman.   I  would leave the dorm at 7:30 a.m. and not return  Carol Ann Wilds (R.) and Judith LaFourest, editor of  WOMANKIND, discuss the Blue Ribbon Citizens' Investigative Committee that has been formed not  not only in her behalf, but for all the women at  The Indiana State Women's Prison.  until 4:00 p.m. in the evening.    Heaven  or so I  thought.  I wasn't very confident that I would get the job  for I had a reputation that had followed me from  the Women's prison as an  activist.     That is the  worst one possible to obtain in the Department of  Corrections.   You must not challenge the conditions  of your confinement if you seek popularity.   However,  I never felt I was sent to prison to win a popularity  contest and I resented the deplorable conditions.  Several phone calls were made; I was given the  job.   It was a trusty area and the calssifications  to trusty status was a must.   No one held jobs in  that area unless s/he had a badge or unless s/he  was a volunteer to clean up detail work.   I was not  eligible for trusty status, still, I went to work.  One day one of the captains came through the  engineering office.   Mr. D. was not present so his  influence then meant little.   The captain began  questioning my not having a trusty badge at which  point I was pulled off my job.   Discouraged and  disgusted I was returned to the dorm to sit at my  bed area that still remained 10-1/2 inches from  the bed next to me.   I waited.   Shortly Mr. D.  drove to the dorm in his personal truck and asked  that I leave with him.   I got in his truck and he  drove me to the Assistant Superintendent's office  and I was provided with the papers necessary to  receive my trusty badge.   We left Mr. Q's office  and went to the custody office and my picture was  taken for my badge.   I was back on the job.  I worked five days a week and was on the dorm  weekends.   These weekends were unbearable  because of the crowded conditions.   Mr. D. began  making arrangements to call me to work on weekends and holidays - at which time we became  intimate.  While on my job in the engineering office I met  many of the male employees and sexual advances  occurred daily.   Since sexual harrassment and  exploitation occur all over the institution, I was  not surprised.   I knew of complaints filed by some  of the female inmates concerning an Officer R.  in segregation who tried to bribe a female inmate  to pose nude for cigarettes.   This inmate, on  another occasion of sexual exploitation, presented  as evidence a sample of semen on a piece of  paper to the authorities.  Other incidents occurred as well.   I met Mr. E.,  the sewage plant supervisee   None of the complaints  by the other female residents had ever been  recognized and when he solicited sex, I complied.  One day I was on my job and a custody officer  came in the office and said he needed me.   I knew  for a fact that this officer had recently been reported  by a female inmate for making sexual proposals,  however again, nothing was done.   He stated I was  to return to the dorm yet he did not know for what  reason.   I got into his van with him and he drove  throughout the institution looking for a place that  was private enough to have sex.   After quite some  time and a fruitless effort, I was taken to the  education department where he stopped the elevator  and proceeded to do everything he wanted to do short  of intercourse.   I was then returned to my job.  By November of 1979 I was pregnant.   Also, in  that same month, I developed a recurrence of  hepatitis.   I went to the institutional doctor and  complained; he told me that there was nothing  wrong with me.   Two weeks later I returned.  Still he said I was not sick.   One week later I was  very yellow, and I returned to the doctor.   Again  he said there was nothing wrong with me, but  failed to give me any kind of examination to  determine this.   I explained my problem to the only  other person I knew would help, Mr. D.  Mr. D. made a phone call to a friend of his in the  lab and she agreed to do the blood work if he would  bring me over.   The test were ran and proved positive.  I had hepatitus.  I was due to meet the clemency board in April in  hopes of a commutation of my sentence.   Mr. D. had  guaranteed me that if I did not make clemency in  1980, that I would make it in 1981.  February, 1980 rolled around and Mr. D. discovered  that the institutional investigator and a dorm officer  and a lieutenant were conducting an investigation  into his relationship with me.   He told me what was  going on and that he was going to stop it He went to  Mr. Heyne, the superintendent,  about it.Mr. Heyne  became angry because he had not been notified that  such an investigation was even going on, and in view  of the fact that institutional policy prohibits such  investigations unless the institution head is aware of  the investigation.  In an attempt to clear Mr. D. , he removed the  investigator from the case, and placed the dorm officer  in a gun tower.   The state police were called in to   wrap the situation up  and  cleat Mi. D.    However  there was a problem, I was pregnant.  I was called in for questioning and asked to submit to  a lie detector test and get  all of this over with.   I refused. In the meantime, I was taken to Evansville for  a court appearance. However, the institution was by  then made aware, by myself, of my condition. Mr.  Q. assured me that I would not be transferred back to  the women's prison  Several days after my arrival at the county Jail in  Evansville Mr. D. came to see me.   He asked what  I had told them and I assured him nothing. The  institution learned of his visit to the county and was  angry that he would allow such documentation to  come into play.   He was advised that upon my return  from court I would have to be transferred back to the  women's prison.   I was quite angry and wanted to seek  public support but I was unsure what to do. Mr. D.  advised me that to go the public would hurt my chances  with the Clemency Commission.  I came back and upon arriving at Westville, I was  loaded up in a van, shackled and chained by two of  the male guards I had been involved with and returned  to the women's prison.   The media got wind of it and  the Department of Corrections made a press release  that made me look like I was merely an lt;  oversexed  whore practicing her trade. They stated employees  had been  forced to resign because of their association with, her  etc. The coverup began.  During this time my midriff was growing.   Cloid  Shuler, the Executive Director of Adult Authority  ceased all co-educational work programs and stated that  he did so because of my pregnancy thus creating a  great deal of anger toward me from the other inmates  in both institutions.   I became more and more concerned  about the safety of my unborn child, and I isolated myself  most of my pregnancy to prevent anything from happening  to my baby.  I wrote the Department of Corrections and advised them  of the dangerous situation that they had placed both me  and my child in by saying my pregnancy was the reason  for the co-educational work programs ceasing.   I inquired  what my pregnancy by a staff member had to do with  the co-educational work programs.   I received a letter  signed by Mr. Shuler stating that I  had to accept  responsibility for my own behavior.   Shuler also sent Mr. Tom Hanlon to see me and  requested that I submit to a test to determine paternity  prior to the birth of my child.   I spoke with a women  from the Department of Health and she informed me  CONTINUED to Page 4

        <pagetext>4.  WOMANKIND  CONTINUED from Page 4  that the test was unnecessary and  I should not do it  since ther e was a possibility it could interfere with the  health of my child.   I therefore refused and was labeled   uncooperative.   In April, I met the Clemency Commission and my  case was continued till June.   They sought updated  psychological and psychiatric reports.   I thought it  might be a good sign because I knew my reports were  good and the psychological report recommended my  immediate release.  In June, they again reviewed my case. Six weeks  later I was denied clemency because of the  seriousness of the offense.   I had the opportunity to read a community  investigation report from Evansville that is considered  to be confidential.   The report stated that the City of  Evansville held the fact that I went to Westville and  became sexually involved with employees against me  and would there fore not recommend my clemency.  Other information contained in the report was *ct*Uy  false.  Mr. B. was forced to resign and Mr. A. was  transferred to Wishard Detention Unit.   I began  receiving letters from Mr. B as well as messages from  him by way of female officers.   The letters contained  strange poems with such statements as  May you be in  heaven two hours before the devil knows you are dead.   I took these as threats and reported them.   Yet no  special protection was offered me or my unborn child.  By this time I fully realized that the ball was totally  in my court and it was up to me because I would get  no protection from the Department.  It was July, 1980 and some relief was in sight from  the pressure I was under at the Women's Prison.   I  was called back to court on a hearing on my case in  Evansville.   My attorney, Mr. Niles Stanton was  able to negotiate a tenative agreement with the  prosecutor on my case, Terry White.   Mr. White  thought that it was in' the interest of justice to reduce  my charge to manslaughter and re-sentence me to  a 2-21 year sentence and turn me over to parole board  i mmediately.   My judge had no objection to the  proposal.   However, Mr. White's superior, Scott  Bowers, immediately squelched the preliminary plans  and my hopes of being released prior to the birth of my  child were ended.    In late August, I was taken to  Wishard Memorial hospital to give birth to my son.  Solely by the grace of God, my baby was born healthy  and the persistant hepatitis that ran throughout the course  of my pregnancy did not affect him.   After less than  three days at the hospital I turned my second child over  to my parents, and I returned to the prison.  Six weeks later I was taken back for my check-up.  My liver tests were still elevated and the doctor  recommended that I be put in the hospital for a liver  biopsy.   I asked the doctors at Wishard to tie my tubes  to prevent anything from ever happening again during my  incarceration.   They discussed it and said  no .   The  reason being:   She is not in position to give informed  consent and it could only be considered forced sterilization.  They did however, at that time, insert an intrauterine  device stating that was my only alternative. Because of my  liver condition I could not take birth control pills.  I returned to the prison with the I.U.D.   A week later,  an infection had set in and the prison had to remove the  I. U. D.   The next week I was taken back to the hospital  for the liver biopsy and I was placed in the detention  unit of Wishard Memorial Hospital.  On September 23rd, 1980, while in the detention  unit Mr. E. a correctional officer on the midnight shift,  came into my room, and awakened me with his hands in  my panties and informed me that he knew who I was and  what I would do and he wanted some of the action.   I  told him that my child was less than 4 weeks old and that  I did not want to have sex with him.   Naturally nothing  mattered.   He was over 6 foot and weighed in at a good  345 pounds. I didn't see myself in much of a position to argue  I left the hospital the next morning and was returned to  the prison.  But this time, I was infected with trichomo -  niasis from him.   I went to the prison doctor.      She did  not examine me, but handed me a box of suppositories.  They did not work and the infection grew worse.   Also, I  had not had my first period since my baby had been born.  I panicked thinking I was pregnant again.  I was returned to the hospital a short time later to be  checked for the I. U. D. that the prison had already removed  and the hospital informed me at that time that I had a  trich infection.   They gave me medication and subsequently  ran a pregnancy test on me from the information I provided  them on the incident that occurred with Mr. E.   To protect  me from retaliation by the prison, they agreed to phone  the tests results into my attorney.   They were negative.  JUNK MAIL  by BEVERLY CROWELL  Palo Alto, CA  I again asked that my tubes be tied since it was the  only birth control available to me, and I was again  denied.   I explained to the institutional medical staff  my fears of becoming pregnant again and was informed  that I could not have birth control pills because of the  condition of my liver and for that matter, the institution  didn't think women   needed them.    I was told to  abstain.  At the time of this writing my second child is nearly  8 months old.   Many of the employees mentioned in  this statement are still employed in the Indiana  Department of Corrections and I am still without birth  control.   My parents currently support both my children  and I am still serving my 15 to 25 year sentence and  can be of no help to their support.  I have decided to file a negligence action against  the Department of Corrections and by the time this  goes to press that action will be in the courts.   The  reason I have decided to file the action is because rarely  a day goes by that someon of the department doesn't  insist that I am totally at fault for my past experiences  and that  men will be men.      I have been denied job  changes because of my past pregnancy, and to date only  one side of the story has been told.   I think that it is time  that the public is made aware of what exactly took place,  and that the sexual exploitation runs rampant within  this penal system.  I do realize the risk I am taking and am aware of the   rippling effects this statement will bring upon me.   I  do hope however, that the public will offer their support  to insure that the negligence action is litigated in the  courts and a decision is made by an impartial hearing  body at the same level.  I am totally confident that upon my case reaching  the Federal Courts a decision will be made favorable  to halt sexual exploitation of this nature.   Most  importantly, I am able to plead my case in complete  honesty which is something I am certain the Department  will not do.   However, much of this is documented and  I will not allow the penal system to by-pass the existing  problem any longer by attempting to pretend that the  problem is merely a figment of a female convict's  imagination.   Others before me have been exploited.  I have been exploited, and women continue to be  exploited.   The fact remains that no one will save us  but us.  A CAROL ANN WILDS FUND has been set up.

That junk mail envelope is your opportunity to speak out for the ERA.  Take each page and write ERA    NOW or  something like:  I can no longer purchase your products.   I can  no longer patronize manufacturers in your State,  (name the State).   I will continue to do so as  long as your State is unratified reflecting your  company's total disregard for equality.

Each envelope that is returned  to its solicitor requires that postage be charged.   In  our free enterprise system a jab to the pocket book is  accepted and expected.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  The Rules  You always told me that this wouldn't last.   I'm not a one-girl man. I move too fast  To wait for you to run to match my stride.  It's better not to call this 'love.'   Don't hide  A simple urge behind a thought complex:  Let's be content to call a spade a spade  And say 'we meet each other's need for sex.  There are benefits for both, when this game's played    We've played the game your way tor thirteen years -  Our match outlasted those of most our peers' I  I've finally tired of living out a lie;  I want to share a kiss and swift goodbye.  The rules you made, so many years ago,  Gave us the privilege of being free to go.  The game was great, but it's grown stale to me  I'm grateful for your rules which kept us free.  by  MARTHA  E.   EUBANKS  Indianapolis, IN  Baggage  Bag-wrapped identities, tightly clutched,  carry nose-wiped kleenex--sad shreds of being,  and play games of existence  with all-powerful (Master's) charge cards.  Cheap compact mirrors, cracked from hard falls  and dusted with makeup used to  shadow I's, reflect carefully groomed,  (to hopefully groom) pocketbooked lifestyles.  Sunglasses screen light from without and within,  while a bottled essence hides an essence  dancing to the tinkly tune of a coined society  with keys to cautiously lock bag-wrapped identities.  by   SONIA   GOLTZ  Plainfield,   IN  Emigrant's Song  Come sit by me  let us toast and sing  to other times and places.  Sway with me  and let's remember  why our allegiance  is divided.  Feel with me  the sun of yesterday  and the gold of  tomorrow, for  I need  your yearnings to  meet with mine  in the darkness of  this night, and when  You listen to me, when  my voice carries sweetness  of other skies and  pain of other lives and  when my heart bubbles  in the wine, then  Come sit with me   again  and together we will braid  our songs into flowers for  tomorrow.  by LINDA FOLEY  Moraga, CA  Her Colt 38  VERSE  Lament for the Adulteress  On my way to the laudro-mat,  at the risk of hearing disco,  I turn on the radio  As a man in Chicafgo tells me  that Khomeini  Shot an adulteress  And Acquitted a murderer.  Listening to the male voice  thick with news  It flashes that nothing is revolutionary  about men destroying  Women who love    men  Embracing their brothers who kill.  I start to crack at the wheel,  the road becomes an open wound,  winding around me...  Around and around  like my clothes in the dryer window.  While I breathe on this planet  The other woman is being buried:  Her blood still warm and furious  At this final rape  by a firing squad.  Did all the jealous wives smile  at this false revenge?  Did all the fathers line-up their veiled daughters  for this public lesson?  This fog hangs  like a cloak of mourning  For the woman shot in Iran  The  Adulteress, my sister, myself.  Shaky, scared and still  cracking  I can imagine with horror  the 'news*  they don't tell us --  While my Iranian sister's story comes as a matter-  of-fact.  Will I really get up  from here  And fold my clothes  And drive  home?  by LAUREL THOMPSON SMITH  Akron, IN  5.  Ode to the Foucault  Swaying, the pendulum circles  Sweeping across an altered path.  Soberly imitating earth's motion,  Predictably, immutably swaying,  Back and forth, gentle gradations.  Arc becomes ragged in the personal cycle.  Impetus derived from the flexible sweeps  Of needs, negative and positive.  Unlike earth's pattern, the arc wavers,  Slackens; erratic refinement of simple errors.  My work is worth while, the pendulum sweeps.  My body is dying, cells gone, the pendulum sweeps.  Loving and giving and gently, the pendulum sweeps,  Forstalling the rage when the taking  Finds nothing to give, the pendulum sweeps.  The pendulum sweep generates living.  Unbalanced energy emerges from enhanced  Self esteem, and deprived rude awakenings.  Dropping swiftly, rising softly,  Back and forth, the pendulum sweeps.  by EDNA SAUNDERS  Washington, D.C.  Essence d'Alice  Recess  I know I smelt  peanut butter cookies baking  during my catechism class  And my skin began to feel  like an afternoon  spent at the beach  I looked out the wet  window pane and saw  a hummingbird building a ne st  A sharp blow on my knuckles  brought my attention back  to the wonders of  God's Universe.    by CATHERINE FOOKS  Phoenix, AZ  Exhortation to a Lady-Courtesan  Cut the coyness and the cuteness;  Disavow your dissoluteness.  Please, let's have a little muteness,  some realistic resoluteness,  and a soupcon of astuteness.  Get thee out of pimp cahootness,  dictated convoluteness,  and seamy absoluteness   Reverse this tidal revoluteness  --become, Ma Devoluteness.  by ROBERTA MENDEL  University  Heights, OH  The Fleeting Moment  He Said/She Said  He said,   I no longer love you.    She said,   I no longer love.    He said,  We have nothing in common.    She said,  We have nothing.    He said,  I am not sure if I'll be coming back.    She said,  I am not sure.

Of course she is  She is perfect  She loves her nice rounded  And soft little body.  It is part of  Essence d'Alice  Clean and smooth  Shampoo-scent still in her hair  She danced into my arms  And allows me  To admire and wonder at her  And I do.  by JILL CHAMBERS  Indianapolis, IN  Wildebeest  The wildebeest run lowing.  Eyes and ears that follow  bring me their desperation.  Suddenly I am no other, I am here  and feel the fear that drives my kindred on.  Dry country, heat, the hurting sun;  I cry with them and run.  In the hard barnlot  cattle are bellowing.  The watering trough is dry  the windmill still.  In the house the family sits down  to a few tiny potatoes,  boiled rabbit one cousin will not touch:  he ran it down. ... it was  too weak to live.  I scream with the wildebeest and run.

Perkins.  Published by Perkins Press, Box 194, Moylan, PA.  Paperback. Handbound  4.  by ARLINE CHASE  Cambridge, MD  UMBERTINA by Helen Barolini, Seaview Books, Bound  edition 424 pages,  10. 95 (1979).  by EVE SIMSON  Indianapolis, IN  CHARTING  NEW WATERS is a potpourri guaranteed to delight and to offend nearly every reader of  the slim volume.   Chocolate Water's third published  book is a mixture of poetry, prose, cartoons, and  photographs that share one lesbian's outrages, crude-  ness, struggles, and loves.   The drawings by Janet  Fons are a definite plus, drawings of strong women -  clothed and nude being fairly rare, are here very  nicely done indeed.  Reading the poems in this book, you will learn:  That Chocolate comes   from a diverse family.  /They're the family--/l'm the diverse.    That the real trouble with women's bars in most  towns  is that we think/we don't deserve/anything  /better.   That the Susan B. Anthony dollar   not only looks  like a quarter/That's what it's worth  making it.   One tippietoe step for womankind.   This  lecherous lesbian  and  pornographic poet   does truly have an original mind, with some nice  twists of absurdity and a gift for narration.   Expect  irreverence and a put-down of something you find  sacred.   Expect also an author who tells it like she  is, but whose objects of satire . may ring true with  some of your own experiences.

Perkins  brings to light in separation and suffering, etc. the  conflicts in each discipline's teachings on love and  sex during the 12th century, a time which epitomized  the  romantic  era in both cultures.   Christian  tradition differentiates between erotic love and  devine (agape) love, teaching that the spiritual  form is by far the better, while the Hindu belief  makes no such distinction, but elevates the sexual  desire to be at one with a partner to include the  desire to be at one with God.  To illustrate her view, Perkins uses the famous  romance between Heloise and Abelard, wherein  Abelard, a 38 year old priest seduces Heloise , a  young woman who is 20 years his junior.   The  author points out that the spiritual union between  the two lovers, after Abelard's castration, is seen  as the only  valuable  love in the relationship.  Only through suffering, and by the separation of  all sexual love from the situation, does their love  become enobled in the Christian viewpoint.  As contrast, in the GITA GOVINDA, the poet  Jayadeva depicts the principles of love as seen in  the bhakti movement of the Hindu religion.   Here  the god Khrishna appeared before the milkmaids  of Vrindavan, tempted them into an erotic dance,  and  gratified them with all the tricks of the Lord  of Love.     When they lament the infidelity to their  husbands, he tells them that they have done nothing  wrong.   Only Rhadna, who denies him her love out  of jealousy for the others, is considered to have  sinned, by separating herself from Krishna's love.  The god then pursues Rhadna, persuading her that  it is only in sharing that they may know true  divinity.   Illustrating two basic principles of Hindu  love, the GITA GOVINDA points out the necessity  of absolute devotion to God, and the willingness  to give up all worldly mores (fidelity to husband,  home society's laws) for a loving Union with God.  Perkins feels that Heloise, in her selfless devotion  to Abelard, her desire to protect his career by  refusing to become his wife, etc., comes ctoser to  the bhakti concept of love as a sacrifice of one's  own wishes to those of the beloved, than to the  Christian concept of spiritual love with attendant  absence of sex, or the romantic love typical of the  troubadors.  The bhakti concept is that the world is a place to  enjoy, that divinity embraces both sexes, and that it  is only through the female that the male diety may  realize himself.   Explaining the concepts in the  simplest terms, yet researching the subject thoroughly,  Perkins gives us a philosophical insight into the  atypical, as well as traditional concepts of love  that exist within our culture today.

The years that are spanned: 1860 to the 1970's-  Part I is the best written and most interesting of the  the three sections.   Set against the Southern Italian  migration to the United States in the late nineteenth  century, it focuses on an illiterate peasant woman,  Umbertina.   Through her ingenuity, intelligence,  and hard work, Umbertina moves her family from a  shack in Italy to a mansion in Cato, New York.  Umbertina is a strong woman with definite values  and goals who maintains her dignity and self-respect  under harsh conditions.   Although she is rigid and inclined to moralize, she eventually achieves remarkable success in the business world.  Part II is set against the intrigues of the Italian  literary circles and focuses on the granddaughter  Marguerite.  Because she feels neglected by her affluent parents,  Marguerite drifts without firm values or goals from one  love affair to another.   She is pathetic, troubled, and  restless.   She is bored with her two daughters and with  her second husband, a sensitive Italian poet who introduces her to the intrigues of the Italian literary society.  For a brief spell Marguerite involves herself in an  affair with a married author, but that leads only to  tragedy for her.  Part III is not as good as the rest of the book.   It  focuses on another one of Marguerite's daughters,  Umbertina, nicknamed Tina.   Tina wrestles with her  reactions to her mother's death.   The author also  describes Tina's break-up with her live-in boyfriend,  her abortion, her visit to the first Umbertina's birthplace, her marriage, and an assortment of mundane  reflections and happenings.   The novel ends abruptly  while Tina is still in her twenties.  UMBERTINA is a thought-provoking novel that  emphasizes characterization.   Helen Barolini proves  herself to be a talented writer.  Part-Time Professionals  According to the Association of  Part-Time Professionals, one out of  six Americans works part-time and  over two million part-timers are professionals. The organization has just  announced plans to become a national professional association with  local chapters throughout the country to build acceptance of part-time  work as an option for employees.  APTP was organized in the  Washington area about two years  ago. For more information, contact  APTP, P.O. Box 3419, Alexandria,  VA 22302. (703) 370-6206.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Why I Didn't Stay for the Breakfast Menu  by ROCHELLE H. DUBOIS  Westfield, N.J.  One Monday morning I applied for a management  trainee position at an airport restaurant and hotel.   Why do you want this job?  the restaurant  manager asked.   I'm tired of teaching.   I want to try something  totally different.     I like teachers.   I was a Speech teacher before I  was hired here,   the manager said.    We do things  differently at Georgy's.   She hired me for the job.  I started on Wednesday and was told to follow  Francine's (the current Assistant Restaurant Manager)  schedule.   I would be training to take her place.  I arrived at 9:30 A.M. instead of the scheduled 10.  I was eager to begin my new exciting job.   I bought a  straw hat since all the personnel for Georgy's restaurant  were required to wear brim hats.   Mary, the Restaurant  Manager, made only  50   a week more than the  Assistant, according to Francine who had turned down  the job because of the longer hours.   Mary handed me  several forms to fill out and told me I, too, would  soon be interviewing'girls* for various positions.  I filled out a one page sheet of health questions,  checking  'No' for a variety of ailments.   Good to get some healthy people in here,  she  smiled.  Mary gave me a tour of the motel including the  poolside area near the bar and the sauna.   The sauna's off-limits to all employees,   she said.   We caught a busboy who took the room key out of  a guest's pants pocket, went up to his room and stole  some items.    Then I was handed over to Francine.  Although Francine was short, she had a nice figure  and a beautiful face  with sparkling eyes.   She wore  dazzling gold jewelry and a model's wide-brimmed  hat.   Why are you leaving?  I asked.   She told me she  wanted to become a model for Wilhemina's of New  York City.   I can't be a fashion model, but I think my face and  hands could be used for commercials,   she said.  Francine gave me various floor plans for the  main and upper dining room, and the upper and lower  lounge area.      She counted the tables and stations.   Deuce there. Four there. The barrel can be broken  down.   Try not to seat too many by the pool because  Millie's new.   It's not hard,   she smiled.    Actually  you're a babysitter for the waitresses and the busboys.   I followed Francine who was head hostess or overseer.    Hello, my name's Rochelle.   Welcome to  Georgy's.   Enjoy your lunch.     I soon caught on and  was seating businessmen, reluctantly paging others from  the bar lounge, and checking on tables to find out if  everything was all right.   Women waiting on men  again.   I hated it.  Lunch was noon until two, and it was a slow day  according to Francine, although Mary later noted  that 375 people had been seated during lunchtime.  At 2 P.M. Francine and I took our 30 minute lunch  break at poolside.   We split a huge Reuben sandwich  from the kitchen.   The busboys, Georgy Girls, and  other employees ate in the cafeteria.   Management  was privileged, I thought to myself.   But why was the  day going so slowly?   I hadn't sat down all day and I  felt like I had accomplished nothing.   Where was the  glamour.   The girls have side jobs for breakfast, lunch and  dinner, and depending on your shift you'll have to  check two of the above.     Francine handed me a list  of the side jobs.  1 Clean and fill ketchup, mustard and steak bottles.  2 Bread baskets - Line all baskets with napkins  3 Tea Set-up  a.   Line 5    8  dishes (for desserts, soups, appetizers, etc.)  b. Fill small cups with cocktail sauce  c. Pieces of lemon.  d. Cocktail forks  e. Steak knives  f. Monkey dishes near butter  (At dinner time 5  dishes  are also needed for  vegetables and sour cream so many more must  be done)  4 Each girl (sic) is responsible for cleaning and filling  her sugar bowls, salt and pepper shakers and cleaning  all silverware on tables with a damp cloth  There were more jobs, but I stopped at   4.  Francine was telling me her life story.  Married for eight years to a land developer, she  confessed,  oui marriage is falling apart; he won't  give me a divorce.   Maybe I don't want it.  I've had a Yugoslavian lover for seven years.   Five  years ago my sister died of leukemia, and we adopted  her little girl.   She's ten now.   My husband adores her.  Me, I like to travel.   I like plush living.   I guess I  like the security, and when I leave here, I've got a  number of plans.   Francine's wrists glittered - her name in diamonds  on a bracelet.    Maybe I married for money, but I  don't care.   After here, I'm going to be a freelance  model, work on getting my new dating service into  shape and take a course at a beauty school, not to  open my own business, but for my self-improvement.    A half-hour went quickly; we toured Georgy's again,  checked the   busboy areas to see that dishes were  stacked properly, that tables and chairs were cleaned  thoroughly, lunch-special cards removed, etc.   The  job was boring.  Francine said,    I go home and pull and out my hair  after work I'm so bored and depressed.   The Georgy  Girls think they're special.   They're spoiled.   They're  teachers who can't  find jobs in schools.   The busboys  are lazy, but you can't blame them as they only get   2.10 an hour.    We took a cigarette break in the back office.   I  learned from Mary that three Georgy Girls had been  fired because they were caught smoking  marijuana  in the sauna room.   Another two had been fired  because they ordered pizza and ate it at their station,  right in front of their afternoon customers.    The day  girls are quickly replaced,   added Francine.    Not  the night girls.   They get good tips.   They look good  too, wear gowns and heavy makeup.      Francine  showed me through the kitchen.   Mary was in there  and looking busy.  Mary said,  Francine, you know what Carol just  told me?  She said a customer complained about  cockroaches on his table, and she told him that was  just one of our many little problems.   She actually  told him that.   Francine said,   That's terrible.   That's like saying,  'Oh, your car was stolen?   That happens  every day  in this neighborhood.'   I don't think Carol's going to  last.   She has no business sense.   She thinks the  'no-jeans'  rule is ridiculous.     I liked Francine even  though she thought nothing of telling me matters that  should have been confidential or not right for a management-trainee relationship.  Mary disappeared to interview various women for  more jobs.   Francine and I walked to the women's  room in the lobby for another cigarette break.   I've only been smoking two years, ever since my  marriage ended in divorce.   I don't inhale though.   I  guess it's just a habit I picked up,   I said.   I felt  I had to tell Francine something.  At 4 P.M. we dimmed the lights, checked to see  that the dining room areas were cleaned and ready  for dinner hour, lit the candles on the tables, brought  the evening floor plan to Leanne, the nighttime hostess,  and met Ralph, the night-time manager.   Leanne slept with Ralph,   Francine informed me.   Then Leanne told everyone he was a rotten lay.   It's  like Peyton Place around here.   I can't stand it.   I  just hope you stay long enough to get me out of here.  I told them a month and a half ago I wanted to  leave.     We tried to look busy until 5:30 when I said  goodbye to Francine.  I was chilled from the air conditioning.   My feet  ached from walking so much and doing nothing.   I  knew I would not go in at 6:30 in the morning to  learn how to open up Georgy's or to study the  breakfast menu.   I was Assistant Restaurant Manager  for a day at  200 a week.   Guess that comes out to   4.70 an hour or  37.60 a day.   Wonder if they'll  mail me a check for one day's work?   Oh well, I  can always substitute teach tomorrow    That's   35 a day WITH a Master's degree.  rubess  W682.

It speaks immediately to those of us  (women) who have bucked the tide to stand on our  own individuality.   Kristin, herself does so admirably.   She definitely is not Punk or New Wave, but  refreshingly up-beat, observant, and she doesn't  need  in  gimmicks to promote her straightforward  voice and t alent.  In this album her versatility comes through crystal  clear and without apology.   She handles classical,  jazz, calypso, country and western and much more  with aplomb and grace.   It really is a smorgasbord  of the best women's music around.  The down-to-earth rendition of country-flavored   Clinging Vine  combines fine vocals, full of humor  and realization, with the best twangs anyone would  want to hear.   Its message comes through with the  artistry intact.   Well if I'm a clinging vine, then you're  a melon  And while I'm on the subject, it's time  that I was  Tellin you goodbye  You're too puffed up to see another's  wor th-  I'll take my roots and twine around the  earth...   It's the Vaudeville-ian tempo which puts the  march back to the church-state in proper perspective,  that makes the unpleasant forewarning in  Days of  the Theocracy  so appealing.   It's the 3-ring circus  quality, the animal acts, the dogs through hoops  for the general amusement of the unthinking that  really speaks.   Lems and company do a good job  on this number with its mocking chorus.   We're going back, back  To the good old days,  When men were really men  And women knew their place;  Back, back a couple of centuries  And welcome back the days  Of the theocracy    The metered study in  Smith Hall,   the beat of   Chicago Calypso,   the comment on heterosexism  in  How Nice  and the final recognition of  Rosa  Parks  are all executed with care and mastery.  Kristin Lems fans are given another chance to  appreciate how good she is on  In the Out Door.    Keep on, keeping on Kristin--we're stUl listening.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Love Notes  by   PAT   HEIDENREICH  Besides writing love notes to his father and me, my  son also writes to the good tooth fairy.   Before the  arrival of the baby, we had built a game room and  two bedrooms in the basement.   The two older boys  moved into the new bedrooms.   I found this note  taped to the note writer's former bedroom door:   Dear fairy my room is downstairs.   I lost my tooth.  Please give me more than a quarter, huny.    Another time he gave this note to a little girl at  school. .  .  dear Cinthea, I like you.   I hate Sherry  Simmons and I like you.   I want you to like me.   Do  you?  Answer:   Yes  or No Love, your friend.   (She checked  no  , so he went back to liking Sherry.)  Of course I often find notes like the following when  it comes to getting out of some chore. This one was  pinned to his cowboy-print bedspread which was in a  heap on the floor.   Mom I don't want this cover,   my bed looks better  with out it and I'm in a hurry,   frum your son, ps I  love you.   And our oldest kid has the habit of writing little  reminders to himself, like this one I saw on his desk  next to a few coins.    I'm very, very, very, very  low on money.    I remember when he was at camp for the first  time, the only letter we received was:    Dear Mom  and Dad.   Their is a hunch back that lives in the woods  here.   His name is Egor.   Love from me.   Our daughter's first letter from camp read simply:   Dear mom and dad.   I fell off a horse today.    One  of her disappointed girl-friends received a blank  piece of paper ... it seems  her assembly line  letter writing on the last day at camp hit a snag.  And although we sent stamped self-addressed  envelopes with the 'note-writer' last summer  when he went to camp for the first time, we didn't  receive any letters from him.   This was so unlike  him that we were quite worried.   He explained later,   The humidity (mispronounced ) was so high in my  cabin, all my envelopes got stuck shut.    I cringed when I read the composition    'the note-  writer' had to write for punishment at school one  time.   The teacher had printed:    WHY I SHOULD  OBEY SCHOOL AND ROOM THREE RULES  on the  top of the paper and told him to fill both sides.

My mother was terrorized by thunderstorms, yet I  never found out until I was a grown woman with  children of my own.   Hers was a very special kind of  courage; she never let us know she was afraid.  I remember when we lived on a lake in Fenton,  Michigan; the spring thunderstorms were awesome.  My sister and I would awaken to the crashing and  find Mother with flashlight in hand.    Isn't the  lightning beautiful   she would exclaim.    Look   It's just like a giant fork    Another crash.    Oh   That one looked like the Road to Mandalay    Elaine and I would watch in delight as the mighty  clouds crashed, lightning danced, and the waves of  the lake grew wilder.   We never understood our  classmates who didn't think lightning was the most  exciting of natural wonders.  In later years, we moved to Indiana.   I grew up  married, and had a child -- all in the proper order.  I missed the thundering rampages we watched in the  Michigan sky.   But, once we did have a great clap  of thunder in a spring storm.   I jumped.   Mother  cautioned me,  You shouldn't jump that way. You'll  frighten your baby, and that's a terrible fear to have.   What do you mean, 'That's a terrible fear to have.'   Remember the grand storms we used to get in Fenton?  We were never afraid.     I know.   I'm so glad you kids never knew I was  terrified.     Mother, what are you talking about?  You loved  thunderstorms.   You used to wake us up to watch them.  How could you be afraid?    That's just it.   It was such a terrible fear for me  that I resolved never to let you kids know.     She bit  her lips.   Her knuckles showed white as she wrestled  with her thoughts.   Decision reached, she relaxed a  bit and spoke:    You see, a woman was killed by  lightning on our doorstep when I was a little girl  in England.   I had to run for the doctor, all the way  through the village in that terrible thunderstorm.   I  was so afraid the lightning would strike me, too.   And  I was always afraid after that.     She paused,  I didn't  want you kids to suffer that fear, so I never let you  know.   And that's what I mean by  a very special courage.   It wasn't one selfless act of heroism.   It was a lifetime.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  ... On   Becoming   a   Mother             In the fall, white silk birds exploded out of withered  brown milk pods, sailed towards the sky, then drifted  to the fertile earth.   Rainbow leaves drizzled to the  ground, and I could see through the forest, the bare  gray trees.  My desire to become a mother climbed to the autumn  blue sky, and flowered deep inside.   The time   ripe,  we harvested our desire.  I wanted the blood inside my body to grow into a  nourishing forest.   At Thanksgiving, I mourned when  it pushed its way out.  Then Christmas vacation began with wondering and  ended with an exulted knowing.  The champagne we drank on New Year's Eve was a  secret toast to our new life, and to me becoming a  mother.  And, I became a mother quickly by learning the  questions and the answers:     How are you feeling?    Congratulations?     When's the Big Event?     Have  you picked names?   I became a mother by listening, as women I hardly  knew pulled their pregnancies out of cedar chests,  dusted them off, and presented them as gifts.  When  I was pregnant, I craved raw potatoes...    Wait till  it starts moving,... like a tiny butterfly inside.   I had  been admitted to a new sisterhood.  I became a mother in bundled up winter walks, an  invisible baby hibernating deep inside.   I studied  winter's simplicity, its paucity of colors: snow curves,  muted green pines, the faded gold of weeds and corn  stubble.   I tried to take winter's lessons into myself,  practicing peace, learning patience.  In fascination with my body's power, I became a  mother, exploring the strange rumblings of nausea  and fatigue.   I studied the events inside: one-quarter  inch at one month... eyelids forming, tiny hands ...  a body I could hold in my palm, with a real head,  eyes, ears and a miniature pumping heart... three  inches...  I became a mother by being afraid   afraid of becoming a dull person locked up in the house all day; afraid  of being ugly; afraid of falling into the mold of suburban housewife, afraid of becoming a trap my husband  comes home to; afraid of being stifled, shut away,  stale, sterile   but wanting desperately to become a  creative earth mother, a goddess.  I became a mother by longing for the wild violets  of spring, by craving cool evenings of star-watching.  I longed to dig in the garden, to bury neat rows of  seeds, to sing with the morning birds, to watch life  emerge.  I became a mother in monthly visits to the doctor,  each visit a milestone of progress.   Sitting in the  waiting room, I would sneak shy, admiring glances  at mothers and babies.   I learned the routine well:  waiting, weigh-in, more waiting, blood pressure,  questions, the inevitable,  let's see how big you're  getting,   followed by  see you next month; take it  easy.   I became a mother in my dreams: tests had shown my  baby would be abnormal; did I want an abortion? One  by KATHLEEN SALAPOW VAN DEMARK  West   Bend,  WI  night, I gave birth to kittens; another night, the baby  crawled out of me and onto the scale.  In early spring nights, an orange moon shining, I  lay in bed, listening for the signs oflife.   Sending  messages of love with my hands, I waited for a reply  and smiled with the kicks of stretching, growing legs.  I grew with the summer.   Sitting awkwardly on the  ground with my belly, I plucked weeds, harvested  beans, smelled roses and talked to the growing flowers.  With summer heat, I rested.  Again, I learned waiting... I cooked and froze meals.  I practiced breathing.   I cleaned house.   I waited and  wondered: When will it happen? Will I know? What  will it feel like?  How will I act?  I became a mother on a warm blue September  Sunday, the beginning of labor waking me at  3 A.M.: a slow drive to a sleeping city, the swirl  of routine preparations at the hospital, the reality of  hard labor pushing me into a trance-like state of intense concentration.   I was inside myself with my baby  struggling to be born.   Thirteen hours of strong, steady  contractions and two and a half hours at eight centimeters with no progress led to the decision to do a  Cesarean section.   Another whirlwind of preparations  amid intense contractions.   Finally, to surgery, numb  and disappointed, only dimly aware; strapped on the  table, I was cold, having trouble handling the contractions that kept coming strong and hard.   They painted  my belly, fed me oxygen; the doctors talked on the  fringes of the operating room.  I became a mother asleep, missing the moment I had  anticipated for years.  They yelled at me:  Wake up, Kathy; you have a  nine pound baby boy.     They showed me a paper with  his footprints, but only the pain seemed real.   They  wheeled me to the nursery, where I saw a big  squalling baby in an incubator, lower lip quivering  with rage.   But my head was foggy, my eyes heavy;  it was hard to understand that this baby had come from  me.  As the pain subsided, love grew, filling me up with  this son who had left my body.   When the nurses brought  the babies out, I would pick out his cry; my eyes closed,  I could see only his face.   I kept his bed at the foot  of mine; he slept, but I couldn't -- I merely stared  at him with wonder.  In the peace of night feedings, Eric sucking time-  lessly at my breast, I became a mother.   We snuggled  warm and sleepy.   The nurse who came to take him  back to the nursery marveled in a softly reverent voice,   Such a perfect angel; such a beautiful gift.     I became  a mother in a sleeping hospital, watching clouds pass  by my window   a parade of faces of babies and old men.  I feel whole, connected with my own mother and  generations past and future, joined to mothers and  babies throughout the world.  I feel afraid.   Coming home from the hospital, I  realized that this commitment is timeless.   The time  of limits   nine months of pregnancy, thirteen hours of  labor, seven days in the hospital   has ended.   I think  of the circle of years ahead, of my son the infant, the  toddler, the child, the adolescent, and I am afraid  for the decisions ahead, afraid of failing, afraid of the  world he must live in.  I feel joy. My days are filled with baby smiles, the  perfect closeness of breast feeding, Eric's head bobbing  up and down with the vigor of his sucking, a tiny hand  resting on my breast. But some days seem like one  long dirty diaper, broken by cries, sneezes, hiccoughs  and leaking breasts. Motherhood consumes me, and I  worry for the lives of the other me's.  I feel fatigue.   It is two A. M., but Eric is wide awake.  He is lying in his crib, watching himself in a mirror hung  from his mobile.   His energetic kicks squeak the bed; he  smiles and talks, studying his raised  baby power  fist.  Standing at the foot of the crib, watching my son watch  himself, I learn motherhood.  Again it is fall.   Eric is strapped on my front in a  baby carrier as we shuffle through a forest of fallen  leaves.   He sleeps, dreaming the lullabies of wind,  squirrels and birds.   Pausing beside a field of rustling  corn stalks, I wonder about myself.   I try to summon  up me the young woman, me the teacher, me the  pregnant woman, but those selves are hiding.   All  that is real is me the mother-person, Eric resting  against my body.  We enter the forest, branches a loosely woven fabric  on a blue background, lemon leaves glowing. We are  wrapped in shafts of sunlight and shadow.  SAVE THE WHALES  MOVING SOON?

        <pagetext>New Building New Director  Patricia Turner-Smith is the new Director of the  Girls Clubs of America (GCA) National Resource  Center.  The GCA National Resource Center at the southeast corner of West and Michigan Streets is to be  completed in June 1981.   This building will house  the first information and research center on girls'  growth and development, including a library and  audio-visual facilities for program development and  training.  Turner-Smith is a part-time faculty member of  the Indiana University Graduate School of Social  Work.   She holds a M.A. in Social Service Administration from the University of Chicago and is a  graduate of Adelphi University, Garden City, NY.  From 1975-1978, she worked for the National Urban  League of Indianapolis as Executive Director of  Project Thrive, a national resource project for child  abuse and neglect.   Prior to this she was a Planning  Associate for the Indianapolis Community Service  Council and Director of Financial Development for  the Indianapolis Y. W. C. A.  WOMANKIND  1 1  Patricia Turner-Smith  The Director of the first center in the U.S. A. where  Girls Clubs professionals can research issues of concern to girls and receive special training in that area.  Turner-Smith is Vice President of the Board of  Big Sisters of Greater Indianapolis and of the Child  Abuse and Neglect Council of Marion County.   She  is a member of the Indianapolis Junior League, a  member of the board of both the Juvenile Justice  Task Force and the Indianapolis Voluntary Action  Center.   In 1978, she was selected an Outstanding  Woman in America.   In 1980, Indianapolis Magazine  named her a  Woman to Watch in the '80s.   Girls Clubs of America is a national service and  advocacy organization with 250 member Girls Clubs,  serving nearly one-quarter of a million girls age 6-18.  There are ten Club centers in Indiana, including two  in metropolitan Indianapolis.   The Max C. Fleischmann  Foundation provided initial funding ( 1,118, 000) for  the Center.   Additional support has been received  from other contributors including the Lilly Endowment,  Inc.   Boy don't you men  wish you could hit a  ball like thatr  Babe Didrikson Zaharias  Athlete  Play by Barbara Field  in Indianapolis  REVIEWED by SHELLEY JOYCE  Indianapolis, IN  The Indiana Repertory Theatre in Indianapolis  closed its 1981 Upperstage season with the world  premiere of Barbara Field's COMING OF AGE.  COMING OF AGE is the story of Jake Millar, young  professor of English Literature, and his wife Zoe.  Leaving children and distractions behind,  the  Millars rent a seaside cottage so that Jake can have  the necessary solitude to write a scholarly paper on  OTHELLO to bolster his final attempt for tenure.   Publish or Perish.   Jake, however, is an incurable dreamer who  uses any excuse not to write.   He chooses instead  to read costume novels (Junk food for the mind,  as he calls them) and to invent elaborate fantasies  involving his department chairman, Ben, and the  up-and-coming professor he regards as his rival,  Parker.   Add to this Zoe's confusion about the validity  of her career sacrifice, Jake's discovery that his bid  for tenure has been turned down, and Zoe's announcement that she is pregnant again, and you have the  makings for a fascinating evening of conflict and  comedy about the coming of age of two individuals  and a marriage.  Norman Parker gave a creditable, intelligent  performance as Jake Millar, the confused writer  who would rather do battle with his nemeses Parker  and Ben as gangster-types conjured up in his imagination than around a table in a faculty meeting.   Julie  Garfield was less believable as his wife,  Zoe.   Scott  McKay as Ben and David Chandler as Parker were by  turns menacing and amusing as the fantasy figures  Visual aspects of the production were up to IRT's  usual standards.   Russell Metheny's realistic set gave  director Leonard Peters excellent playing areas in  which to stage the action and fantasies    Carol  Oditz' costumes were well-conceived, from the  just  plain clothes  of Jake and Zoe to the tongue-in- cheek  costumes for Parker and Ben.   William Armstrong's  lighting not only set the mood but also cued the  audience to changes from reality to fantasy  The play's greatest weaknesses lie not in production,  but in the play itself    Field, a playwright with excellent credentials (She was Playwright-in residence  at O'Neill National Playwrights Conference in 1976 and  1979) has simply tackled too many subjects thereby diluting their potential impact    The game-  playing, OTHELLO imagery, and literary refer  ences that I found so entertaining only distracted  most of the audience from the point rather than  illuminating it    Then too, the character of Zoe  was not as clearly defined as she could be,   causing  some uneven exchanges in a play with so few characters.  COMING OF AGE is a creditable effort,  and IRT is  to be commended for encouraging new plays and  playwrights    Judicious cutting of exposition,  tightening of imagery,  and balancing of character  complexity would result in a play that would aid  Jake and Zoe on their journey: COMING OF AGE.

Though I was fascinated by your poetry section, the  paper as a whole was super    I found it informative,  enjoyable, historical.   An asset to  womankind.   Again, I thank you for your help, your paper, and  your time.  Cordially yours,  B. Blue  Muncie, IN  I was very happy to get a response from my  letter.   I appreciate earnest concern.   Thank  you for the list of possibilities for publishing my  poetry.  Also, I appreciate the subscription form, but I  was fortunate enough to have a friend subscribe to  WOMANKIND for me as a Christmas gift- a gift  I found to be of great worth and thoughtfulness.  As for my poetry, I am quite the  Rookie.    In fact, I've never attempted publishing before.  I guess your paper is truly an inspiration     it  inspired this woman to donate the only gift she  could think of to give to me.  I work as a sewer maintenance person, and I'm  the first woman to ever do it here.   I don't know  about other places.   I feel great about it. I've  gone through some crazy  and unbelieveable treatment, experiences, and changes due to this.   In  fact, I had to contact Human Relations - now Civil  Liberties.  I know - truly know, the importance of people like  you and publications like yours.   They are what  keep the women alive and well (mentally and spiritually).  Thanks from the bottom of my heart.  B. Blue  Muncie,  IN  I got a kick out of seeing my picture (upper right  corner) (by J. LaFourest) in your ERA March spread,  Volume II, Issue XIV. I would like to have a copy  of the picture itself, enlarged if possible, to include  the rest of the person to my right and so would like  to get in touch with the photographer.

I am not sure who sent me Issue XV of WOMANKIND,  but I certainly appreciated it.

I would like to  subscribe. My check is enclosed.  A friend of mine, Steve Davenport (a well-known  graphic artist called 'Royce') receives your paper and  always brings it here to work where I read it.  I like WOMANKIND because it feels more round,  more completely rounded, than the majority of  women-only publications which I have come across.  I don't believe in any kind of segregation.  So I'm pleased to have you around and am very  much looking forward to receiving the first issue of  my subscription.

FROM THE EDITOR:  In many ways this has been one of the hardest issues  to get to press. My apologies for any errors and omissions. Please advise me of them. I'm getting a thick  skin and a hard heart and have decided it's impossible  to turn out a paper that pleases all of the women, all  of the time.

( The Seasons  Come   Go , Iss.17, Vol.11)  I was very pleased, and I thank you for your time  and the editing you did on it. Even though my letter  to you did not reach you in time, it was interesting  to note that your choice of re-titling was so close to  what I suggested.  Thanks again.  With best wishes,  Linda Foley  Moraga, CA  I am working on a project to record the thoughts and  emotions of women after they have had an abortion.  It is intended to be a sequel to my first, book CONVERSATIONS IN A CLINIC, which addresses the issue of  why women have abortions.  Women who have had abortions are urged to participate by writing their feelings or recording them on  a cassette tape and mailing them to me at PO Box  326, Harrisburg, S. Dakota 57032. Your identity is  NOT needed. Please omit it from your correspondence.  These statements will be used at meetings and will  be edited for inclusion in a pro-choice  pamphlet to  counteract misleading and exaggerated claims by so-  called  pro-life  activists.  If you are willing to say,    I had an abortion, I  don't regret it, and I've had no adverse physical or  emotional effects from it,    please take the time to  write me.  Kindest Regards  Helen Forelle  Harrisburg, S.D.  I intended to send money for a subscription to your  magazine (which a friend of mine, Cordelle Ballard  subscribes to), but I neglected to, thinking I had.  Meanwhile I sent you a short prose piece, called   I Thought of Woman   Yesterday, visiting Cordelle, she showed me the most recent issue of WOMANKIND which delightfully had printed both my  prose piece and my friend's wonderful  Flapper    piece.  Would you do me a favor, and begin my subscription with the issue in which we are both published? (Vol. II, Issue 17)  Sincerely,  May Harding  Hamden, CT  Editor's note: See  Her Legacy  on page 8.  Your 17th issue is here  It delights me to find my  Flapper story so well edited. I am additionally grateful. Its publication has given me a great lift of spirit.  ( The Flapper's Companionate Marriage )  If you can provide extra copies, I should like 10  copies. I am enclosing a check for them, and for a  new subscription to be sent to my niece.  I see a glorious future for WOMANKIND. All good  wishes to those who are working hard to put it out.  Sincerely,  Cordelle Kemper Ballard  West Haven, CT  Please send one WOMANKIND poster (cover of  Issue 12 -- the mountain collage of women, with  calligraphy by Jill Chambers.)  I've enclosed a check of  5.50. Please send as  soon as you can.

        <pagetext>2.  WOMANKIND  On January 10-11,two of the coldest days  in Indiana's history, the WOMANKIND CENTER  had extensive water and steam damage.  A -51   wind chill against the CENTER'S  north wall and the heating pipes froze and  burst in three different areas on the main  floor. Water damage was extensive in the  basement area.  For two months we have been trying to get  get things back to where they were before  and we were in a mess then   We are getting there, but it's a slow  process because we must continue to do  all the necessary daily things,too.  During TERRIBLE JANUARY the WOMANKIND  CENTER remained open and functioning, although in a limited fashion, and often  those who could make it to the CENTER  had to work in hats, coats, and gloves.  Needless to say that is why the  WOMANKIND publication is very, very late  and not in the same typeface all the way  through. Yes, the Machines were damaged,  too.  Someone said that this winter was  just  another test to see if we really want the  WOMANKIND CENTER and the WOMANKIND publication to make it.   No, more  tests, please   Multi-Million   Suit Filed  The Chico Feminist Women's Health Center  has been called to federal court regarding their multi-million dollar antitrust  suit against nine Chico obstetrician/gynecologists, the Butte Glenn Medical Society,  N.T. Enloe Memorial Hospital and Norcal  Mutual Insurance Company. The defendants  Have hired six maior California law firms  and generated hundreds of pages of legal  opposition in their attempt to deny their  conspiracy against Chico Feminist Women's  Health Center.  On January 22, 1981, the Chico, California,  Feminist Women's Health Center filed a landmark multi-million dollar antitrust suit  against the organized medical community.  For seven years no Chico based physician  has been willing to work in the Chico clinic.  The Chico medical community has boycotted  the health center by making policies to  not refer clients to the Chico Feminist  Women's Health Center and by pressuring  new physicians not to work at the health  center.  Despite this conspiracy, the clinic continues to provide high quality health care  to women in northern California, but not  without an extra burden placed on the clinic  and the women who use their services.

PLEASE NOTE NEW ADDRESS     Susan Catania is a first-rate, nationally  respected legislator. She has a long record  of selflessness in the fight for women's  rights, minority rights, and the rights  of the poor and oppressed.  Catania for Lt Gov  Representative Susan Catania   (R.)   is  the chief sponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment in the Illinois House of Representatives  She   has   decided   to   run   for   the   office  of lieutenant governor in the Republican  primary because Governor Thompson is support   ing    a    blatant    anti-ERA   candidate   for   that  office.       That candidate is Representative  George Ryan,  currently Speaker of the Illinois House.  Ryan has consistently thwarted all moves  to ratify the ERA by blocking a rule which  would permit the House to vote passage of  the ERA with a simple majority vote.  If   the   rule   which  now  requires  a  three-  fifths vote is changed to one requiring a  majority,   the ERA will immediately be ratified  in  Illinois because there has always  been a majority favoring the Amendment.  Catania has come to the conclusion that  Governor Thompson, who professes to support  ERA,  must be persuaded to bring pressure  on Speaker Ryan to let the majority rule.  She determined that the best way to bring  this pressure was to run against Ryan in  the   primary.      And    she   has   decided   to   run  on an ERA platform.  The campaign may promise to be mean  and difficult.     In a recent session of the  Illinois legislature, Catania repeatedly  clashed with Speaker Ryan over the rules  change.     In a seemingly revengeful act,  Representative Ryan fired Representative  Catania from her post as chair of the Illinois Commission on the Status of  Women.  The battle lines are drawn.     For  the first time in recent memory,   Illinois  voters    will    have   the    opportunity    to   vote  for  or against the Equal Rights Amendment.  The    outcome   of   that   election   will   have  national significance.  Send    your    donation    to    Susan    Catania   /  c/o WONANKIND  or  stop in the W0NANKIND  CENTER  AT 3711   N.

        <pagetext>Forever Free  Indianapolis Museum of Art  January 20 - February 21, 1982  The often-neglected yet remarkable achieve  ments of black women artists were displayed  in the first exhibition of its kind:   Forever Free: Art by African Women, 1862-  1980,  (January 20 through February 12)  at the Indianapolis Museum Art. The exhibit  was from collections throughout the United  States and included paintings, sculptures,  drawings, ceramic and mixed media objects.  Lectures, films, tours, family arts activities, concerts and a career workshop for  junior high and high school students inter  ested in art were also a part of  Forever  Free.   Forty-nine artists spanning a one-hundred  and eighteen year period were represented.  The exhibit was organized by Dr. Jacque  Fonville-Bontemps, curator for the Center  for the Visual Arts Gallery, at Illinois  State University, a full-color catalogue  of the exhibition is available.   Forever Free  presents the highest quality work by women who must be counted  as among the best artists of their generation  i.e.,  Barbara  Chase-Riboud,  Betye  Saar,  Catti, Suzanne Jackson, Marie Johnson-  Calloway, Sylvia Snowden and Alma Thomas  as specific examples of outstanding artistic  achievement.  The exhibition traces the artistic  product of these black women from Emancipation and the unfulfilled dreams of Post-  Reconstruction America, through World War  II and the present consciousness-raising  issues concerning both women and blacks.   Forever Free,  an 1867 sculpture by  Mary Edmonia Lewis depicts a romanticized  view of slaves freed from their chains.  Contempory social comments are made by  Elizabeth Catlett's  Tired  (1946); Faith  Ringgold's  The Flag is Bleeding  (1967);  and Victoria Susan Meek's  ...And the Lyn-  chings of the 70s Comes in the Form of a  nighty Horse  (1980).  The pervasive, continuing influence of  African Culture and the African craft tradition is clear in Winifred Owen's  initiations: African American  (1978), and  Festival Form  (1975), a ceramic bowl by Viola  M. Wood.  However, despite the accomplishment born  of professional training and an understanding of the mainstream of art and art  history,  these artists,  who happen also  to be black and women, have largely been  ignored by art critics and historians alike.  Before the Civil War, African-American  women had few, if any, opportunities to  practice the fine arts.  After the  war, some black women attempted to bridge  the gap between the African craft tradition,  once so prominent in their lives, and Western  art, but met with little success.  First  brought  into  prominence  by  abolitionist  and early feminist causes, the black women  struggling with a variety of art forms,  most successfully in sculpture, faded into  obscurity with changing social attitudes.  Throughout the remainder of the 19th Century  and until after World War II, black women  artists found few outlets for their talents,  with even fewer discovering their own  artistic identity and style. The rise of  Abstract Expressionism and the civil rights  movement coincided to establish an African-  American sense of pride, resulting in new  artistic opportunities for blacks in America.  To clarify and expand the history explored  in  Forever Free,  the program series included lectures beginning with  To be Female  Gifted and Black: the African-American  Woman's  Cultural  Tradition,   by  Darlene  Hines, associate professor of history at  Purdue University and continuing with Winifred Owens, one of the artists featured  in the exhibition, Emma Lou Thornbrough,  professor of history at Butler on the history  of black women in Indiana, Sr. Franceses  Thompson, Assoc, professor of theatre and speech  speech at Marian College, and Adrienne Seward,  Art by African-American Women  1862-1980  Winifred R. Owens. INITIATIONS: AFRICAN  AMERICAN, 1978, stoneware slip decoration  assistant professor of folklore, Colorado  College.  Sunday activities designed for parents  to enjoy with their children were based  on the theme  Art as an Expression  of Oneself.  Led by local Indiana women  artists,  the  activities  culminated  with  a weekend of events and a career workshop  for junior high and high school students.  This activity was led by Carol Ann Carter,  assistant professor of printmaking at St.  Mary's College, Notre Dame, Indiana.  A special concert with Bernice Fraction  of the Indianapolis Opera Company, a series  of films by black filmmakers and stars,  gallery concerts and special tours on  the exhibition completed the program cycle.  The 214-page fully-illustrated catalogue  that includes artists' biographies and  essays selling for  20.00 to Indianapolis  Museum of Art members,  25.00 to all others.  April 8 Debate  A debate featuring Karen DeCrow, a New York  attorney and former president of the National  Organization for Women(NOW), and Phyllis Schlafly, an attorney and leader in the fight against  the Egual Rights Amendment, will be held at  Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis in the Lecture Hall, Room 101 , at 8PM.  This event which allows extremely divergent viewpoints on the role of women in  our society is sponsored by the IUPUI Women's  Caucus and the IUPUI Progressive Student  Union.  For more information, call (317) 925-0089.  From SOJOURNER  Indpls ' Shelter  Attached is an institutional subscription  to WOMANKIND for SOJOURNER.We look forward  to having WOMANKIND available to the women  we serve.  We are pleased you were able to come to our  our Open House and share in our celebration.  Sincerely,  Barbara Raye, Director  SOJOURNER  (A shelter for Abused Women;  Indianapolis, IN.  A shower was given for SOJOURNER by the  FRANCES WRIGHT/Downtown Indpls NOW. The  event took place in the WOMANKIND CENTER  on April 4, 1982.  Who Came to Dinner  in Upstate New York?  On the evening of October 15, 1981 artists  and organizers in Ithaca, New York waited anxiously to see how many women would appear at  a spontaneously planned dinner, called a  performance piece  by Los Angeles artist Suzanne  Lacy. Included as part of a national performance art festival at Cornell, Lacy's performance was to work with women of the small  college community to create an event on an  issue important to local women.  Racism and lack of dialogue on the subject  was a priority so Lacy and her collaborator,  Ithaca filmmaker Marilyn Rivchin, began to  plan an event that would include the participation of women from many different walks  of life.  It took less than a week, start to finish,  to determine the theme of 'uomen honoring  women'    with special focus on the local  history of abolitionists and suffragists     to plan a program that included music, poetry  and honored quests, and to advertise the dinner.  Then, at 6:00 pm, they began to arrive,  two and three at a time: elderly church-  women came first, then professional women,  teenagers, colleoe students, feminist activists, photographers, teachers, homemakers,  musicians and a video crew. Almost a hundred women, some invited that very day, arrived with their  dish to pass.   As the dinner commenced, Rivchin, who  coordinated documentation with Betty Burke,  announced,  The events important to women  have been left out of history; tonight the  significance of what we are creating together will be recorded by ourselves, by the  writers, photographers, quiltmakers, poets  and historians among us.   The great grand niece of Harriet Tubman,  80 year old Eleanor Washington, read from  her distinguished ancestor's memoirs, and the  town historian, Helen Blauvelt, reminisced  about her suffragist mother.  Each woman who attended brought with her  that evening the name and memory of a woman  important to her past. On the wall hung a  large canvas, painted with a massive bare-  branched tree. Throughout the evening  women signed their names on the branches and  signed the names of women they each remembered on the roots of the tree. Toward the end  of the program each woman stood, introduced  herself to the others, and spoke movingly  about her experience of the evening,   it was a celebration of women young and old,  black and white, and, while it did not address the real issue of racism, it showed  there is a possibility to do so in this community,  Carolyn Whitlow, poet and co-mistress  of ceremonies, remarked after the event.  Early the next morning a small planning  group met to brainstorm ideas for future  projects on racism and women.  Ideas flew  around the table: a citywide patchwork guilt,  each square a portrait memorializing a woman  special to its maker, tours of the underground railroad stations, temporary  her-  storification  markers that would announce  hundreds of accomplishments and events in the  lives of local women, and a much larger dinner in the spring that would draw at least  500 women from the various racial and ethnic  communities. o j.-  j i. /,  Continued to page 4  If each person who reads this would/could send  the WOMANKIND publication c/o the WOMANKIND  CENTER,  10 to  20 , we would be able to raise  a substantial amount to put into the building  fund. We have less than six months to raise  the remaining  12,000 deferred down payment.  Because of the rough winter and the sharing of  needed   raising space with WOMANSPACE:  A FEMINIST CONNECTION, our income has been cut  in half. Again, the publication will have to  rely on its readers/subscribers for contributions. However, this is the first time we  have asked each of you to contribute. If all  goes well, and we believe it eventually will,  a year from now the publication and the WOMANKIND CENTER will have a permanent home.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Multi   Million   continued from page 2  The Chico Feminist Women's Health Center  has had to recruit physicians from 150  miles away and has been forced to fight  numerous unfounded state investigations  initiated by the local physicians.  Women who use the clinic's abortion  services are forced to go to neighboring  towns to receive follow up care after  their abortions because the local physicians have refused to provide emergency  back up services to the Chico Feminist  Women's Health Center's abortion clinic.  The doctors are acting like they have  something to hide. Since we sued the doctors  the Butte Glenn Nedical Society has instructed  its members not to interact with the health  center. This is exactly why we initiated  the law suit,  said Delores Nolan, Director  of the Chico Feminist Women's Health Center.   The doctors have to realize that they can  no longer dictate the kind of health care  women are going to receive. If the doctors  would cooperate and work with women controlled  clinics instead of trying to close them  down, health care for women would be improved.   Who Came to  Dinner  continued from page 3   Because the event was created as an artwork,  said editor and writer Nancy K.  Bereano, co-mistress of ceremonies with Whitlow,   it gave us the opportunity to gather without  the usual expectations one might have for a  meeting or program. It was fun as well as  inspiring, and left us wanting to do more.  Tree: A Performance with Women of Ithaca  is one of a series of community organizing  celebrations Lacy has instigated as part of her  commitment to bring together feminist practice  and theory with performance art.  During the  last five years feminist performance artists  have begun to create art that actually  effects, as well as simply reflects, women's  life experiences. This artwork initiated a  process in Ithaca. Part of its success  will be measured by what happens during the  next year as a result of our first event.   A Women's History Week  On March 8, the Federal Women's Program Committee of the U.S. Army Finance  and Accounting Center (USAFAC) at Fort  Benjamin Harrison(near Indianapolis)  presented a premiere program to celebrate  National Women's History Week.  The main speaker was Dr. Frances Dodson  Rhome, Indiana University Professor and  well-known locally and nationally for her  activism in the women's movement. Rhome  was the coordinator of the Indiana National  Women's Year Convention(l977) and was a  delegate to the National and International  Conferences. Her many and varied achievements can be found in several of the Who's  Who publications.  Rhome discussed the beginnings of women's  organizations, i.e.  the Wednesday Club  and  the  Working Girl's Society,  and how the  Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor  came to be. Rhome speaks with knowledge  (often first-hand and as a scholar) of the  women's movement. She was introduced as a  leader, a mentor and a role model. It was  evident she was all three and more.  Rhome was confident that even  beyond  ERA   there will be a new day for women.   Women Who Kill-Author in Indpls  Ann Jones, author of Women Who Kill was  in Indianapolis during the second week of  December(1981). She was working on a story  on women in prison for two papers in the  East. Although she spent most of her time  at the Indiana Women's Prison in Indianapolis interviewing Carol Ann Wilds (see  issues 18, 19,   20 of WOMANKIND) she did  manage to have dinner one evening at a local  restaurant with a WOMANKIND representative  who was delighted to spend some time  with the author. And Ann Jones was  all and even more than she had expected.  Several incidents occurred that prompted  Jones to complain to the manager about the   sexist attire  of the waitresses, the  way she was treated by the waitress(men  at a neighboring table received  special    attention), and most of all about the  restroom signs:  Captain's Ladies   for women and Captains' for the men.  Ann Jones overlooks nothing.  Afterwards she asked her companion:   Why did I feel I had to do that? Is that  important, too, when there are so many  other things....  They both decided everything that discriminates is important.  (A signed postcard with 10 signatures was  later sent to the restaurant requesting they  consider some of the problems women might  object to at their establishment whether  voiced or not. Not everyone is an Ann  Jones, but it would help if more women  were.)  On December 9 WOMANKIND/WOMANKIND  Center arranged for Jones to have a   relaxed  press conference at the WOMANKIND  Center. Local radio, television, news,   nd  magazine media were present. That night  and that week Ann Jones popped up on tele-  vision, on radio, and on the printed pages  of Indianapolis and Ft. Wayne, Indiana  newspapers.  (One television station said  the press conference was given at the  Indiana Women's Prison. The WOMANKIND  Center is not an IWP annex.)  Women Who Kill was reviewed in Issue  XVI of WOMANKIND by Carol Ann Wilds.  If you have not read Women Who Kill, a  well-researched and well-written book, do  so.

For example, amenorrhea, or failure to  menstruate, is the first clinical symptom  of anorexia nervosa, the  starving sickness   which has recently come to national attention.  Anorexic youngsters literally starve themselves  to death. In our super-thin culture many  of these disturbed young women are too far  gone to save before family and friends  notice anything is wrong.  Several other menstrual problems signaling everything from life-threatening  illness to improper diet or posture, are fully  and intelligently dealt with in this book.  Subjects covered:  *Why menstrual cramps occur  *What happens during menstruation  *The causes of excessive menstrual flow  and reasons for failure to menstruate  *Why women experience premenstrual tension  *What to expect as menopause approaches  *What can cause infertility  *How safe are tampons   What drugs are considered safe and e  effective  A must-read for mothers, daughters, aunts,  grandmothers, cousins, nieces, women friends,  and the men in their lives who don't think the  problem is all in our  cute little heads.   The first meeting of the Indpls/In. Feminists  Writers Guild will convene on Sunday, May 9  at 2 PM. This is an organizational meeting  to discuss the purpose of the guild and the  programs to be scheduled, and the national and  local dues.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  On Conquering Fear  by MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  Indianapolis, IN  For the beginning of this story, we must  go back to the beginning of my memory;  back to the night terror that stalked my  childhood sleep and left me shaken and fearful even after I awoke. For several years  and for several times each of those years,  I dreamed that I was a child of another  race and culture and time.  It is always mid-afternoon, on a sunbaked  stretch of savanna where the tall drying  grasses whisper constantly from their wind-  powered movement and from the peregrinations  of small animals and insects. It is unbearably hot. The few birds that fly are wheeling  slowly, on the lookout for live or newly-  killed feed. I am (always noted with amazement) a small, dark child-person, age and  sex unknown. Like the German  Das  Kind, I suppose that for all practical reasons,  all children are truly neuter. I know that  I am dark because my thin little brown  arm waves before me, parting the grasses to  facilitate my progress. There is a film  of oil covering my skin; atop that, small  beads of perspiration catch the sun's rays.  I am hurrying back to my family's fire  for two reasons: first, I have tarried  too long and my mother will be cross; second,  I am afraid to cross the grassland. As I  enter a denser growth of tall grass, fear  overwhelms me. I do not know how I know  this: whether a sound has betrayed his  presence, or a scent I only know from past  life, or a moment of movement seen or felt.  I know there is a big cat over there, to the  northwest of me (I am headed due west),  waiting for me. It would change nothing for  me to alter my route; he would overtake mo  at his will. I can only walk forward.  My entrails curl in anticipatory agony. I  am afraid  But I know I must continue.  Always, until the final time, this is  where I awoke. Tongue clinging to mouth-  roof, breath ragged, heart fibrillating,  eyes bulging, nostrils flared, the last  cell in my body telegraphing fear.  At first, I cried until one of the adults  in my family came in to soothe me and hold  me until the terror faded. Later, because my  elder siblings called me a  Scairdy-Cat,   I lay in my bed dry-eyed, but literally  shaking with fear through the long nights.  The level of terror did not lessen  If anything, it became stronger with each recurrence.  Finally, almost numbly acceptant, I  willed myself to complete the dream. I  would not succumb to fear again. When the  dream began again, next time, I was ready.  I was no less fearful than before, but I  was determined to end the torment one way  or the other. The grasses parted before my  wet, brown hand. I was dripping perspiration  and breathing noisily as I came close to  that dread spot where my Fate awaited me.  One more forward step, than I saw the moving  tail  I froze. The tail-tip continued  curling left, then right. The grasses did  not as I had anticipated bend aside as a  huge feline body lunged toward me  There  was only a crunching sound, accompanied  by a low growling. I pushed one more handful of grass aside. Before me lay a mag  nificent leopard, crouching over the body  of another small, brown child. Again, this  victim had no discernable sex. It was a  child. Sufficient unto the story and to the  leopard, it was a dead child, being consumed  by a hungry leopard.  I let the grasses spring back as a curtain  between us. I stumbled on until I could  see past the horrible vision in my mind;then'  I ran. I ran as if the wind sailed me toward  home. I ran until my breath could no longer  fuel my aching muscles, until the miraculous  pump of my heart was fluttering with pain.  Then I lay down on my stomach, far removed  from the bloody feast,face down in the  tall grasses and renewed my strength.  When I was strong enough to do so, I willed  myself to awaken, I knew that I was cured,  now, of this night terror. The leopard would  never again stalk me, in this life. He never  has.    But sometimes, in the nights, I pop  awake with a question in my thoughts which  I cannot answer. I wonder which dream-child  was really I? The dream-child who escaped,  or the dream-child whose juices stained  the leopard's jaws a lovely, cherry-red?  Despite the unanswered question, I learned  that fearsome thoughts dissolve when met  head-on and that conversely, they flourish  when they are evaded. This is not to say  that running around the block rather than  meet a killer face-to-face doesn't make  good sense. It only says that that killer  will still be free to stalk someone else, or  possibly you, again. It means that facing  up to an unpleasant thing often has to be  done only once, while avoiding it must be  done forever. As long as the avoidance  is extant, so is the unpleasantry.

New Jazz Record  by Linda Gray  Glenwood, IA  The latest album by the jazz quintet ALIVE  is called CALL IT JAZZ. The album was recorded Hue; and if a recording can convey this  much power and emotion, then seeing the  group in person must be an exhilarating and  exhausting experience.  Rhiannon's intense and powerful performance of the lyrics is reinforced and expanded by the music of the other members: Members of the group are: Carolyn Brandy,  congas, small percussion; Janet Small,  acoustic piano, fender rhodes, and supporting vocals; Barbara Borden, drums; Suzanne  l/incenza, acoustic bass, and supporting  vocals. The collective result allows the  listerners to experience such emotions as  anger, longing, tenderness, love, faith,  joy, and determination.  My favorite cut from the album is the  Ida Cox classic  Wild Women Don't Get The  Blues.  It is a sarcastic, fun-song with  an explosive chorus.  I've decided,if I ever grow up, that I  want to be a wild woman like the one in this  fine album.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  A different kind of quickie....  by JUDITH RAE  Indianapolis, IN   David   I screamed.  Stop the car.  It's here  The baby is here  Now     Relax, sweetheart. Your labor just started. It can't be time already.    My God, David   Stop the car     Pant, dear. That will help you calm  down.    Believe me, David   It's too late to  pant  Stop the car    He pulled over onto the shoulder of the  road. We were about twenty-five blocks  north of our home on the south side of  Indianapolis.   Now, Judi...  he began.  I grabbed his hands and placed them on  the baby's head, which by now protruded  completely out of my body.   Now will you take me seriously?  I asked.   Good grief  You're right. Get in the  back seat.    Are you kidding? It's ten below outside.  And windy. I'm not moving   Just catch when  I push. But first get the baby blankets  out of my suitcase.   I jerked my panty hose down to my ankles.  Then I pushed once, and the baby slid into  David's hands.  I grabbed a blanket, and David put the  baby into my arms. I felt over-joyed as I  heard the baby whimpering. Sticking my  finger into his tiny mouth, I flicked out  mucous. I wiped off his face. David was  already speeding to the hospital.   Is he OK?  David asked.   He seems to be fine.    Thank goodness we knew not to mess with  the cord. It was hard not to push, but I  knew I had to keep the placenta inside of me.  David and I had both attended the hospital's  pre-natal class. One night an expectant  father posed this situation:  Say your wife  is in labor. You're driving her to the  hospital, and she says,  it's here. The  baby is here. What do you do?   Fortunately we had listened to the answers  given by the nurse who taught the course.  She would have approved our actions.  The drive to St. Francis Hospital was  the longest fifteen minutes of my life.  Unanswerable questions darted through my mind:  Was my baby all right? Would the sub-zero  cold put him into shock? Would I hemorrhage  as I did after my first baby?  Our arrival at the emergency room produced  a frantic flurry of activity. It was quite  a challenge getting my placenta-attached son  and me out of the car. (David and a nurse lifted us out into the icy cold air and put us  on a stretcher.) When the attendants automatically wheeled us into the labor room, everyone  laughed. But that seemed as good a place  as any to cut the umbilical cord.  Since hospital rules stated that babies  born outside of the hospital must be isolated  from the other babies, our new son Mike  had a bassinet in a nursery all to himself.  He received an abundance of attention from the  nurses and their aides.  My son is now a healthy, normal ten year-  old. David still thinks I get overly emotional. And I decided that two children  were enough for any family   Plath Papers  Smith College in Massachusetts recently  acquired about 4000 pages of manuscripts  and typescripts of poet, Sylvia Plath.  Manuscript poetry, journals, diaries, notebooks and annotated books are included.  I'm  Not Ready  by PAT HEIDENREICH  The generation gap was quite visible  as my son and I toured a State University  during  Acquaintance Day.  The program -  was geared to high school juniors and their  parents preparing to select a college.   And this is a typical dormitory room,   said the freshman tour guide, as she led  our small group into a little room that was  unnaturally neat.   What time are lights out?  I asked innocently.  My son elbowed me in the ribs.   Lights out?  smiled the guide.  What's  that? We don't even have hours.    You mean, the kids can stay out as late  as they want?  I asked horrified,   Of course,  she said, winking at my son.  One of the other mothers gave me an  understanding look as we funneled out into  the hall.   How do you think the drug problem here  compares to other campuses?  I continued,  as we walked to the Geology Building.   Oh, we've only had two drug raids, so  far. It's the drinking that's out of hand.   she answered matter-of-factly.   Oh,  I mumbled. My son gave me a  dirty look....I gave him one back.  As we waited to get into the Planetarium,  I left the group for a minute to visit the  restroom. I couldn't help but notice a  large sign posted near the mirror. It read:   Did You Give More Than You Got? ...and went  on to list symptoms of certain diseases  I  thought to myself,  I'm not ready to be  the mother of a college student   At times  like these I always have the urge to revert  back to the cocoon....as I rejoined the  group I was mumbling, I want my Mommie and  Daddy.    What?  asked my son.   Oh,  nothing. ...1 tried to erase my  stunned expression.  After the tour,  as we walked to the car,  I noticed a group of boys playing football  wearing only thin T-shirts and gym shorts....  and it was a cold,  damp day.   See.  I said to my bundled up boy.   When these kids get away from home and their  mothers,  they don't take good care of themselves.    They'll probably catch pneumonia.   A tear glistened in my eye.     Will you  promise to dress warm and write to us often  and study hard and not drink and not have  girls in your room and not go to their rooms  and not stay out late at night?   A tiny smile played on his lips.     Sure,  Mom,  he said as he   gave me a little hug.  I felt better.    But then he said:     Gosh,  Mom,...I can't wait to go to college.    It's  gonna be a blast    JOYCE    R.

Husband: That was certainly a  good Mother's Day sermon today, wasn't it?  Wife: Yes, that was a fine sermon.  Husband: That woman he talked about was really something. Up before dawn to fix breakfast, sews for the poor, buys a field and  plants it, a hard working woman, a good  mother and wife.  Wife: Yes, and all her husband had to do  was set and talk with the other men.  Husband: Too bad there aren't any women  left like her today.  Wife: She was some woman all right.  Husband: The Preacher's right you know,  the trouble with America today is the working mothers. They should be home with their  children, don't you agree?  Husband: He had a real good point though.  Maybe there wouldn't be all the unwed teenage mothers and drug crazed kids if their  mothers were home taking care of them.  Husband: And I liked the part on the Submissive Wife. The Apostle Paul said the  wife should be in submission to her own husband.  Husband: Well anyway, it was a good sermon.  I didn't go to sleep on it.  Wife: Ho,  I didn't either  Husband: What's the matter, hon? You  don't look very happy.  Wife: Oh, I don't know. All of a sudden  I feel a little down.  Husband: Well heck. The kids sent you  flowers, and I am going to take you out  for dinner. It's Mother's Day; you ought  to be happy.  Wife: I know, but right now I feel more  like crying than going out to dinner.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Rite of Spring : Women Writers Gather  Written after attending the Third Annual Women Writers Conference in 1981  The power of a new place affects consciousness.  The written word is transformed as it is expressed by the artist.  I still see/smell Lexington in early April   dogwood, magnolia,  forsythia in full bloom three weeks ahead of central Indiana....  by LAUREL THOMPSON SMITH  Akron, IN  Marilyn is driving my f64 Dodge and I  sit between her and her son Aaron, age  one. We sing ourselves into spring, into  the  12-a-night motel room across the  street from the U of K stadium. Hearing  our own voices out-of-the-ordinary excites  us. Can real adventures happen so easily?  We are participants in a very special  rite of spring   a celebration of women  writers who are gathered for the third  annual Women Writer's Conference at U of  K - Lexington. I come timidly, although  I m known as a strong woman in some parts of  Indiana.  I feel as a Marge Piercy poem:  Until we  are all strong together,/ a strong woman  is a woman strongly afraid.  If Piercy's  hands can shake (though her voice does not)  during a question and answer period, then  my heart can beat hard and fast for three  days solid.  Sherley Anne Williams reads her fiction  and poetry, words on fire. I am strongly  afraid with Williams   with her position  as a creative black woman in academia;  with her protagonist, Odessa, the heroine-  slave who is condemned to die.  Why didn't I hear Williams' or Paule  Marshall's name when I studied Black American literature? Why have I not ever seen  the anthology, Midnight Birds(edited by  Mary Helen Washington) as a text for American  survey courses? Black women writers are  the step-children of an Afro-American literary tradition which focuses on the black  man's experience.  So we see the pain; we need the healing.  How do we become strong together?  Adrienne Rich and Mary Helen Washington and Marge Piercy say  READ. Know your  history; ask yourself who is writing and  for whom. Does this writing speak to me;  does it treat my female experience authentically?   When Adrienne Rich looks at you, she  looks in you   her intensity invites touch.  And so I touch. Her words   spoken so clearly,  so intuitively   echo my hidden' thoughts.  Hers is a power not seized from men( Men  have control, not power ). Rich's power  knows the depth of darkness, like the  ocean that is untouched by sunlight or  enlightenment, and is full of life. Rich's  power celebrates the tradition of women  who empower themselves through sharing     Ancient Mirrors  If you purchased a copy of Ancient Mirrors of Womanhood, Vol. II by Merlin Stone  (3rd printing) and have found that the first  32 pages are missing, please return the incomplete book to: New Sibylline Books, Inc.,  Box 266   Village Station, N.Y.,N.Y. 10014.  The company will send you a  complete  book  and a refund of  1.00 to cover the postage  incurred.  VERACITY  CRITIQUES  Route 1 Box 195 Cambridge, MD  21613  WRITERS, LEARN THE TRUTH  ABOUT YOUR WORK   through the laying of hands on our own   natural resources.    Feelings are important,  said Rich.  But  when women gather together, don't just talk  about your feelings without recording them.  We need women's journals, women's publications, women's letters, women's literary  work as our history.   (Marilyn and I have shared letters for      years   and books, and philosophy in the  kitchen, and visions in the woods. Part of  our journey to Lexington is to celebrate us,  and that is another reason why our excitement is wonderful and scary. Female friends  are often reserved for shoulders to cry  on, and we are here in joy and love. Why  is this so rare?)  Writing as woman's work, not her therapy  or her hobby, was the theme of the conference itself. Marge Piercy brought this home  with special force:   Write when you have to, not as an exercise. Share that which is real for you.  Don't try to write a novel if it(the art,  the experience)is really a short story.   Piercy   powerful, funny, dramatic    is  very much a minstrel: One who sings of our  culture with political forcefulness, and  of real women with feelings and flesh. At  her reading, the poems are charged and  charging: as Piercy herself.  I remember the audience giving a loud  responce to  Right to Life,  a poem affirming women's right to abortion. Piercy in  turn challenged us with her own response:   Alright, then do something   Now  Women  are dying.   ...one reason we are strongly afraid.  N.Y. Writers Conference  HOPE: COURAGE; INSPIRATION and CREATIV  ITY is the theme of the 11th Women's Writing Conference/Retreat sponsored by the International Women's Writing Guild.   The conference will take  place at Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,  August 13-20, 1982.  The week-long Conference/Re treat is open to all  women regardless of professional writing accomplishments.  Cost is  350.00 for full week inclusive of room  and board.   Weekend rates are  180. 00 (single)  and  160.00 (double).   For further information contact:   Hannelore Hahn, Executive Director, IWWG.  P. O. Box 810   Gracie Station, New York    N. Y.  10028.

If you  have a  21,20,19,or18   this is your last WOMANKIND you will receive UNLESS you send your  subscription payment.(If you recently sent  a check or money order,  of course this does  not apply to you.)  When we cross the Ohio River at Cincinnati,  it is midnight. Marilyn is driving,  we're on our way home;  Aaron is asleep.  We're high on the cretive energy generated  by women,  and as women we respond.  Yet I have said nothing about the theater  workshop,   or the readings by Appalachian  women or the workshops,  or the women we  met   women who have made choices different  from us,  and we celebrate their power to  choose.  We  joined together for a write of  spring and still you may not know how  Adrienne Rich sounds as she reads a poem,  or how soft-strong Sherley Anne Williams'  hand is.  But this is my song,after all.  If you don't make it to the Fourth  ,  come  to the Fifth Annual Conference in 1983.  The FOURTH UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY WO -  MEN WRITERS CONFERENCE will be held in Lexington   Kentucky, April 1-3, 1982.  This conference is free:   no preregistration is required.

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  No Rest for Rookie of the Year  by CAROL L. SIEGMAN  Indianapolis, IN  One would think the off-season of a Ladies  Professional Golf Association (L.P.G.A.) golfer  would be one of relaxation and retrospection.  Perhaps this is the case for tour veterans.  But Kyle O'Brien is a rookie on the tour.In  fact, she was Golf Digest Magazine's 1981 Rookie  of the Year so O'Brien has had little time to  relax. She is already looking forward to next  season with great anticipation even though this  one has been hectic.  To give you an idea of her schedule: In a matter of a few days, O'Brien spoke at a junior high  Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting, flew to  New York City for the Rookie of the Year awards  luncheon, returned to Indianapolis for an early  morning radio interview, packed,and moved on to  Springfield, Ohio to work with her teaching professional, Tim Tague. All this before going to  Florida to practice for the J.C. Penney Mixed  Team Classic, in which she was paired with fellow Hoosier Bill Kratzert.  At Springfield, a telephone interview revealed  the vivacious personality of a winner. O'Brien  spoke confidently, but modestly about her recent and past successes. She mentioned that the  Rookie of the Year presentation included a brief   history of the past recipients.  Prededed by  such golfing greats as Joanne Carner, Jan Stephenson, Nancy Lopez-Melton, and Beth Daniel.  O'Brien views the Rookie of the Year Award as  an  indication of things to come.   Most would consider O'Brien's competitive  spirit and willingness to work hard,inherent.  Roland Inskeep, athletic director at North  Central High School in Indianapolis, says:   She's got that O'Brien confidence  alluding to  her father, former basketball superstar for  Butler University. O'Brien acknowledges her  parents' encouragement, but is thankful that  they did not mistakenly become overzealous.  A protege of Don Essig III, formerly of  Hillcrest Country Club in Indianapolis,  O'Brien displayed her golf potential as early  as age eight. According to Essig, Kyle had   a lot of ability and a world of confidence.  You could tell at a very early age that she  was going to be a winner.   During her junior year O'Brien played on  her high school's state championship golf  team. The following summer she was runner-  up in the- national junior girls' tournament.  Returning to high school her senior year,  she found the girls' golf coach had married  and moved away. With four of the five girls  from the state championship team returning,  there was no one available to coach them.  That was the year Roland Inskeep became the  girls' golf coach in addition to his responsibilities as athletic director. The team  won the state championship for the second year  with Kyle O'Brien receiving the mental attitude award.  Between golf tournaments, O'Brien managed  to compile a very impressive record in basketball, too. She played on the first Indiana  state all-star girls' basketball team in  1976.  Moving on to the warmer golfing climate at  Southern Methodist University where she  earned a B.A. degree in physical education  j.'itn a mino in Spanish, O'Brien tried to bs   very realistic and very objective  about  her future in golf.  A happy Kyle O'Brien at the 1981 LPGA Mayflower  Classic in Indianapolis.(Photo by C.Siegman.)  Kyle O'Brien promised herself that she  would pursue professional golf if she thought  she  had the potential to do it.  When SMU  won the AIAU collegiate tournaments in 78-79,  she began to see pro golf as a reality despite  some temporary setbacks. For a short time,  she felt she was not performing to the best  of her ability and was letting her teammates  down.  Asked how she handled these types of pressures, she responded that her faith gives   her purpose and direction.  She also relaxes to music.  O'Brien openly admits that her past experiences help her handle the pressures of  the tour. Although she has  always been  part of a winning situation,  she sees problems as a way to grow.  While not enjoying inclement weather,  O'Brien does not shy away from adverse course  conditions. In fact one of O'Brien's best  finishes was at the Rail Charity Classic in  Springfield, Illinois, on a rain-drenched  course.  O'Brien finished second to tour veteran  Jor.nne Carner. This was an important finish  off our backs  Great Feminist Journalism  ourllth year  oob provides  * National and international news about women  * Thoughtful commentaries, and news ahead of its time  * Health, prison, and labor news  oob, 1724 20 St. NW,  Washington, D.C. 20009   7/year    sample copy  1.00  SUBSCRIBE TODAY   cDrdtnfanfi  to her because like the Mayflower Classic,  her hometown tournament, the Rail Charity  Classic attracts many loyal fans who are  nicknamed  Kyle's Krowd.   When asked about the controversial poses  in Fairway Magazine, an L.P.G.A. publication, O'Brien said:  I think it's great.  Realizing that galleries and purses are larger  for the men's tour, O'Brien feels the image  of women's professional golf is changing,  all for the better. She feels  the men  reached their peak' and that  any way to  get them (spectators) out is OK as long as  it's in good taste.   Professionally speaking, O'Brien does  not feel that all golf courses are designed  to cater to the men's style of play. While  some courses place more of a premium on  accuracy, appealing to many of the women  golfers, the L.P.G.A. conditions and grooms  the course for the women  according to the  average on the tour.   Kyle O'Brien's competitive attitude is  in keeping with the true spirit of the sport.  Always wanting to play her best, O'Brien is  also  happy to see anybody do well...I never  root against anyone.  However, her priorities  for 1982 are to  win a golf tournament  and  to have a  great year.   Women in Civil Service  A recent study by the Center for Women  in Government indicates that narrow eligibility requirements bar many women and  minorities from top civil service jobs.  Karen Burstein, President of the Center's  Board of Directors, says the study has  national implications since the promotion  process used in New York is similar to  processes used by governments throughout  the U.S.  The study, which examined the New York  State promotion process for 249 managerial  selections, found that women and minorities  do well when allowed to compete in the examination process.  The problem,  Burstein  explained,  is that they seldom hold one  of a narrow group of job titles that make  them eligible to compete for managerial  positions.   The Center has organized a task force  to work with New York State, its public  employee unions, the New York State Personnel  and Affirmative Action Advisory Councils,  the Women's Advisors and other organizations  to identify and implement a variety of responses to the findings.  * For further information, contact Nanci  DeLucrezia, Center for Women in Government,  State University of New York at Albany,  Draper Hall, Room 302, 1400 Washington Ave.,  Albany, NY 12222.

The 1982 INDEX/DIRECTORY OF WOMEN'S  MEDIA provides a network of existing women's  media, as well as ideas women have on the  overall issue of restructuring the communications system.  The DIRECTORY, with 351 women's periodicals (over 100 outside the U.S.), is an  aid to networking and is published to increase communication among women nationally  and internationally. Over 80 women's presses  and publishers, 64 women's bookstores,  34 women's music groups, 25 women's  film groups, 40 in art/graphics/theater,  and others in radio, TV, video, cable,  women's columns, news services, distributors,  speakers bureaus, special library collections  on women, and other categories of women's  media   as well as hundreds of individual  media women and media-concerned women in the  Individuals section   have listed themselves  with addresses, phone numbers, contact  people and descriptions.  With this resource women, community groups  and others with information can locate  women's periodicals interested in getting  their information out. Writers can locate  publishers, periodicals, and writer's groups.  Presses can locate women's bookstores and  vice versa. Film groups can contact  distributors.  Women with regular radio  and TU programs can contact music groups  for material. Being annually updated assures  accuracy of information in the DIRECTORY.  So interesting are the various entries  written by women around the globe that  it makes fascinating reading simply to  learn what women are doing   apart from its  usefulness as a directory of women's media.

Enclosed is my check for a subscription for  me and a modest contribution to keep Womankind  going.  Also enclosed is a letter that the New York Times  Sunday Magazine did not choose to publish.   They  ran a cover story based on Betty Friedan's latest book  The Second Stage.   I hope Womankind will publish  this letter.  Feminism is not a monolithic movement.   We have  some earnest disagreements, indluding mine with  Friedan, just as there are areas on which we do agree.  It's important that we air both.  Since I do not assume that my name is a household  word even among feminists, I will further identify myself as a former chair of the Board and then President  of NOW(between 1970-74).  Keep on keeping on.  Cheers and Warm Wishes,  Wilma Scott Heide  Sangamon State University  Springfield, ILL.  In Betty Friedan's recent critique of feminism and  call for  new directions,    I think the author projects her own earlier relatively limited understanding  of the implications of feminism onto the thousands  of other feminists who have long understood what  feminism portends.   We(feminists) always knew that   sexual politics  never meant man, meaning males  per se or all males,   were  the enemy  as she alleges.   It was and is patriarchal values, androcentric practices, dominance of  masculine  principles  over  feminine  principles and the institutionalized  oppression and privatization of women in politics,  education, religion, media, health care,  family  just for openers.  It was and is a male-oriented and dominated  society that sanctions:   rape of all kinds, pornography,  women-beating, unequal economic opportunity and pay, sexist language, unshared child care,  medical (patriarchal) models of so-called health  care/ religions where God is characterized as male  and therefore the male is God, and politics that  characterize  women's issues  as separate and unequal and demand compulsory heterosexuality and  pregnancy (bedrocks of patriarchy)from women.  Friedan should accurately use the word I (meaning  B.F. ) instead of we to characterize what she interprets as the  firstltage.    Betty Friedan is premature about the  second stage   because she almost implies that the  first stage  is  accomplished.   For hundreds of thousands of us,  feminism always meant that what she calls the  second stage  was an integral prerequisite to feminist  transformations.   This means we insisted not only in  changes in casts of characters in the world that is our  home, but changes in scripts in employment, in law,  y Jhz.  lt;Jjxlia.n (L ntzx  1100 West 42nd Street  Indianapolis, Indiana 46208   (317) 923-9919    A Counseling Center for Women'  in politics, in international affairs, in health care,  in media, in art, in sexuality, in conflict resolution,  in re-definitions as well as distributions of power.  Finally , feminists have never eschewed families  in the generic sense of social units and environments  where people nurture and are nurtured.   We reject  the white patriarchal model of family which oppresses women and children and represses the  feminine   potential of men (and oppression is not to be equated  with repression).   Most feminists never saw women's  liberation only as individual freedom to be and become, though that is vital, and most feminists always realized feminism could liberate men from  stereotyped limitations.   Feminism's imperative and  potential is to move beyond the terrors and destructions of patriarchy and androcentricity militarily and  in all social institutions of society.   We always knew   the personal is political and vice versa.    Friedan states that  men may be--must be--at the  cutting edge  of what she calls the  second stage.   Wrong.   Men may share in the  cutting edge  of what  are still the first and abiding stages but only on feminist terms that include the power of love, in the sense of caring about ourselves and others, exceeding the  love of power.   These are not  new directions , but  continuing values transformations always affirmed and  portended by feminism.  I would like to hope that Betty Friedan and men  come to know this.  WOMANKIND is interested in publishing a review of Betty Friedan's THE SECOND STAGE.Please  submit manuscript before April 30.  Feminist Conference Grailville  An ecumenical feminist conference will  be held July 11-17, 1982 at Grailville, a  conference center in Loveland, Ohio. Responding to a sense of impending crisis, approximately a hundred feminists of different  religious visions and ethnic backgrounds  will come together to critique contemporary culture and explore elements of an alternative future.  Participants in the dialogue vuiW include  those who find in the biblical traditions-   Jewish and Christian   vital resources  for feminism; those who reject the biblical  traditions as inherently patriarchal and  seek an alternative vision in ancient or  modern goddess-centered approaches; and  those who relate feminism to a racial,  ethnic and/or socio-economic revolution with  or without a biblical base.  Grailville, located on a 350 acre farm  twenty miles northeast of Cincinnati, affords  the opportunity to balance intense discussions  with walks in woods or fields, work in the  gardens, a swim in the pond or a quiet time  in the oratory-a remodeled 150-year old  barn.

Nothing may be reprinted without permission.              1978  A labor coalition pressing for passage of the Equal  Rights Amendment in Virginia organized a march and  rally in downtown Richmond, Virginia, on the last Sunday in January. It was the first major labor ERA move  in the country and was billed as the largest ERA demonstration ever held in that state.  ERA activists travelled through snows and freezing  temperatures from New York, Washington, the outer  edges of Virginia, Indiana and other neighboring state s  to support   the Virginia action.  OVER 3200 WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN, tramped down Franklin Street in Richmond to the Capitol  Grounds across from the State House. The procession  stretched for 11 blocks and passed residences,  restaurants, churches and stores where onlookers  flocked to windows to watch. Chanting and singing, the  marchers waved  200 years is long enough   and  Only  Three More   (states until ratification) signs. A long  blue banner from Washington blazed 'Equality of Rights  Shall Not Be Denied or Abridged on Account of Sex   across the main Richmond avenue.  I carried one side of a skinny paper  Ratify ERA   pennant while a young girl from the east cost clasped the  other end.  After we reached the Capitol park, state and local  labor leaders broke into a barrage of pro-ERA speeches.  Ellen Pearson, vice president of Crusade of Votes,  yelled,  My copy of the Virginia Constitution says that if  this government ceases to act in the best interest of the  population, then it is our responsibility to ABOLISH it    To that, the demonstrators loudly agreed, meaning that  ousting anti-ERA rascals is essential.  LAST FALL, A KEY ANTI-ERA representative,  James M. Thomson, was unseated in the general elections, improving ratification chances somewhat.  Later in the afternoon, the marchers gathered in some  ERA headquarters across the street. I asked Ellie  Smeal, president of NOW, where to target ratification  efforts for 1978. She said,  In '76 and '77 it was a mistake  to target for only a few states. We need to press for approval in every unratified state.  She said, too, that the  most important actions for ratification are to push for  extension of the March 22,1979 deadline and support for  the convention boycott. Scores of organizations as  diverse as Senior Citizens of American and the National  Educaton Association are refusing to hold conventions in  unratified states. The most recent result has been  Chicago's convention bureau issuing a pro-ERA  resolution and lobbying in the state legislature because  of  15 million in lost convention business.  BETH RAGO  1/1  Ui   lt;D  o   gt; gt;  O     *- gt;  o  xi  Epilogue: Despite strong support, street demonstrations, and a recent poll showing 59  of the Virginia electorate in favor of the ERA, the Virginia House Privileges  and Elections Committee defeated the Amendment before it got a chance to be heard by the full House.  Write your Congressperson:  Support H.J. Res. 638  the ERA Ratification  Extension Resolution  A vote for the extension  is a vote for all women

Nancy states,  We all become bogged down in the hectic pace of living, with our multiple responsibilities and  with our daily battles. It is important for us, as sisters, to  stop and refresh ourselves and one another, to inspire  each other, to take stock and gather our strength   both  individually and collectively. That is what WomanShine  is all about.  The producton company is seeking persons who are interested in theatre and in producing non-sexist drama.  Theatre experience is not necessary.

        <pagetext>Page 4  WOMANKIND  Abortion    Forum    Continues  Abortion, The Law and the  Right to Life Movement  The Issue is Freedom  By MARY ANN DOLATOWKSI  CONTINUED FROM ISSUE IV  In 1973 the United States Supreme Court handed down  a 7-2 decision in the case of Roe vs. Wade effectively  granting women the conditional right of privacy in  matters of her own bodily procreation under the  auspices of the right to due process under the 14th  Amendment, rights restricted to citizens under the 9th  Amendment and the Bill of Rights and its penumbras  which protect personal privacy of the citizen. This  decision did not give women the absolute right to abortion, but limited the right to the first trimester of  pregnancy and gave the state the right to regulate after  this point so long as regulation reasonably related to the  preservation and protection of maternal health. Further  more, the court held that the state had a compelling interest in the potential life of the human being from the  point of viability and could proscribe abortion at this  point. The decision totally avoided attempting to define  the point at which time the embryo or fetus becomes a  human being for it was felt that to attempt to resolve this  question was not within the purview of the court. In subsequent cases the Court reinforced its decision by  refusing to uphold that parental or spouse consent was  required under the law for a woman who wished an abortion.  IT WOULD APPEAR that the immediate effects of the  Court's decision would have been to make the choice of  abortion available to all women on a non-discriminatory  basis, at least in the first trimester of pregnancy, and  the removal of the stigma of criminality from this  choice. However, a review of events since the Court's  decision would indicate that freedom of choice for  women in the matter of abortion in most respects has not  been implemented. Although the criminal stigma has  been eradicated by law, access to abortion largely  remains with those women who live in large metropolitan areas and who are in the middle or higher income  classes. Abortion services remain concentrated in one or  two large metropolitan areas of each state and in some  largely rural states abortion services remain virtually  unavailable. As a consequence, the young and the poor,  particularly in rural areas, continue to face difficulties  in obtaining safe, legal abortions. It has been estimated  that between 250,000 to 750,000 women requiring such  service in recent years have been unable to obtain them.  THE PRIMARY ANTI-ABORTION  GROUP is the  National Right to Life Committee, which is a coalition of  Right to Life groups formed throughout the nation  during the 1960's to oppose abortion reform. Their  philosophy concerning abortion rights is essentially that  of the Roman Catholic Church which is not surprising  considering that many of the original Right to Life  groups were formed at the urging of the church particularly at local levels. A prime example of the  machinations of the church in their formulation are the  Right to Life groups in California. When liberalizaton of  existing abortion laws were being considered in this  state the Los Angeles Catholic Diocese hired a firm of  political strategists, Spencer-Roberts Associated, to  organize the Right to Life leagues in the state in defense  of  the rights of the fetus.  Although they attempt to  give the appearance of a heterogeneous, interracial, in-  terfaith group their membership is comprised of approximately 85 to 90 percent Roman Catholics with the  remaining membership being  well-publicized participants from Orthodox Judaism and conservative  Protestantism.   Their philosophy concerning abortion is based on the  theological position of the Roman Catholic Church, a  philosophy they are attempting to impose upon all of  society through the pasage of a constitutional amendment protecting the life of the fetus. Their position is  based upon the premise that life begins at the moment of  conception and that abortion destroys life at its source.  Consequently, those women who would choose abortion  over an unwanted child or a child born with defects are  murderers and should be treated as such under the law.  Although even the most stringent of former state laws on  abortion made exceptions when medically necessary  their philosophy does not perceive any situation where  an exception would be warranted. They emphasize continually that justice must serve life and when balancing  the life of the embryo or fetus against the health or even  the life of the mother the potential life must always come  first. Furthermore, they do not regard quality of life as a  legitimate criteria for justification of abortion as they  maintain that there is no such thing as an unwanted  child and that the child with foreseen mental or physical  defects cannot anymore be deprived of the rights to life  than the child that may be born mentally and physically  normal. This is based on the theory that life with defects  and /or limitations are some nature is unavoidable.  (Continued to Page 10)  By JUNE JACOBS  Religious faiths in the United States hold widely differing views on abortion. Some do not approve of abortion for any reason, others believe it is acceptable only  under certain conditions, and a large majority believe  that the decision should be made by the woman, according to her religious beliefs, her own conscience, and in  accordance with sound medical practice.  The Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights is a group  of 26 Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish organizations,  each of which has an official position which supports this  right of individuals to make decisions about abortion in  the light of their own religious faith and moral conscience. These organizations hold many differing positions  about when abortion is morally justified, but they are  united in support for the legal option of abortion for all  women.  MOST PROTESTANT AND JEWISH groups have  reached positionswhich oppose restrictive abortion laws  because these laws compel women either to bear unwanted children or to seek illegal and often medically  dangerous abortions. They are neither just nor enforceable, and they discriminate particularly against poor  women.  The religious organizations which make up the  Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights strongly oppose  efforts to circumvent the ruling of the United States  Supreme Court by denying the legal option of abortion to  particular segments of the female population, such as  the poor, the young, those living in certain areas, etc.  Most importantly, these religious bodies believe there  should be NO abortion laws which reflect any ONE particular religious viewpoint. Rather, the state should  remain neutral, leaving each faith free to practice and  teach its beliefs as guaranteed by the United States Constitution.  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED in helping to safeguard  the legal option of abortion or if you would like more information about the Religious Coalition for Abortion  Rights, please contact June Jacobs, coordinator of the  Indiana state affiliate, 1100 West 42nd Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46208, (317) 299-8034.  Abortion Rights  By   SUSAN  FLANARY  WOMEN FOR WOMEN OF CINCINNATI. INC  411 Oak St., Cinn. OH 45219.  The days of apathy and complacency on the abortion  issue are over. If you believe in the right of every woman  to decide for herself whether or not to have an abortion  we need your support. Already the ability to exercise  this right has been taken away from poor women and  President Carter has admonished poor women to accept  this denial of their rights because  there are many  things in life that are not fair.   Radical right wing organizations, in alliance with  groups opposed to abortion on religious grounds, are  pressuring state legislatures to call for a constitutional  convention that would pass an amendment prohibiting  all abortions. Nine states have already called for a constitutional convention. Another 25 are needed.  To change the government's attitude about abortion,  lobbying efforts must be made.

HEW employees will ge their Christmas checks, health and education programs will get  their '78 budgets funded, and few poor women will get  their abortions paid for. But very few. Those that do will  be very ill   suffering from a physical health condition  which two doctors have certified would be aggravated  to the point of becoming  severe and longlasting  if the  woman were forced to continue her pregnancy to term.  Or, if they are victims of rape or incest, they must  know enough and be brave enough to report the crime  promptly.  To its credit, Congress was compassionate enough not  to condemn a seriously ill woman to life in a wheelchair  or iron lung because of complicating pregnancy. But  where was the compassion for the thousands of other  cases which would not be covered by this restrictive  language? What about the woman who has been in and  out of mental hospitals for years, whose hope for  recovery is completely destroyed by a pregnancy she  neither planned for nor understands? Or the woman who  has nine children already and simply canot support  another? Where is the help for parents who know from  medical tests that the child they expect will be severely  deformed at birth with little chance for survival? Was  there no compassion for the woman in rural America  who is fortunte if she ever gets more than paramedic  treatment in her lifetime   let alone sees two doctors to  certify need for an abortion? Hard case, to be sure, but  neither exaggerated nor rare in today's society. And all  such cases would have trouble qualifying for coverage  under the language finally adopted by Congress.  We should, of course, be grateful for what we did gain.  The language is somewhat broader than last year's exception only for the woman's life. Moreover, thanks goes  to the Senate for refusing to yield to the House's strong  insistence on coverage of only forced rape   to prevent  teenagers from the  temptation  to claim rape (under  statutory rape laws for minors.) That proposal also  raised the ridiculous spectre of women beggin rapists to  beat them so that they could prove the rape had been   forced.   PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, we gained   and  kept   the support of almost two-thirds of the U.S.  Senate. While we did not have the votes in that body to  strike the abortion language completely from the bill  when it first came up in June (remember those days,  when we still argued discrimination and equal justice?),  the Senate easily adopted the  medically necessary   language. The more the issue was kicked back to them  by the recalcitrant House, the more comfortable the  Senate became with provisions recognizing legitimate  health reasons for abortion   and the more supportive  they became. Moreover, as the House refused to make  even small concessions in the face of honest Senate attempts to compromise, the number of Senators supporting the Senate language increased. They basked in the  national media's praise for their attempts to be   reasonable,  while the Hyde-Flood Revue in the House  continued to label every Senate offer  abortion on  demand  and revealed themselves to be unconcerned  about both the health and welfare of American women  and the salaries of thousands of Labor and HEW employees.  Those same Senators will still be here next year, when  the issue of public funds for abortion comes up again   on  the Labor   HEW bill, Defense or other legislation which  anti-choice groups have in mind as targets. The Senators  know and understand the arguments now, but pro-choice  advocates can't take them for granted. They must be  remembered for this year's hard work and supported  next year. The same goes for pro-choice supporters in  the House. Finally, there is only one effective way to  deal with the anti-choice Congresspeople. Defeat th  ,Ti  at the polls. Otherwise, this year's small gains will be  worthless, and there will be no more in the future.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Satin    Doll  Page6   Satin Doll, that's what we called her. All the fellows  thought she was the finest thing walking,  my grandmother said.  I didn't know we'd end up on opposite  sides of the family then, back in the forties.  She continued,  Collester was built like a brickhouse, with long  coal black hair, a super tiny waist and shapely legs   the  only girl in her family so she was able to look like a doll.  Yes honey, your Aunt Collester was a regular mankiller  back then.   Grandmother paused before she added,  She's still a  good-looking woman. You can see a lot of that Indian  blood in her; you know her mother was a Cherokee. I  remember when she was doing hair. She went to school  right there in the Walker Building, down on Indiana  Avenue. Yeah, graduated from Madame C.J. Walker  Beauty School. Her father owned a barber shop on the  Circle but later moved the business over on the Avenue.  Honey, Collester could step out in a different outfit every  weekday and change up twice on the weekends. I mean  shoes, hat, coat and purse to match. Me   I was glad to  have a coat. I guess that's the difference between those  who have children and those who don't. But, the good  Lord watched over us just the same.   I smiled as Grandmother told me more of Aunt  Collester. I could picture her a real satin doll. Once I  asked Aunt Collester about her nickname. She blushed  and admitted that she was a  clothes horse.  That same  afternoon we reminisced; first she'd remember a  story, then I'd recall an incident. We laughed especially  hard over one time when I was six.  THAT DAY AUNTIE WAS KIND enough to be my  babysitter. Because I was young, I didn't like to stay at  her house   it was old, it smelled old, and it was filled  with old people.  During my stay at Auntie's, she demanded that I  sit  still and be quiet.  This was difficult for a six-year-old  surrounded by old folks, dressed in drab clothes,  smoking filterless cigarettes and soggy cigars.  The grown-ups spit tobacco into half-filled coffee cans  used as spittoons, watched the six o'clock news and  spoke of aches, pains   and who's died, who's sick and  who's who. They'd yawn and doze, wheeze and snore,  and their heads would drop from their shoulders but  theyVcatch them before they fell off. Certainly, I twitched in my seat from boredom and I was willing to make  any noise to break the monotony.  AUNTIE cautioned me again by saying,  Children are  to be seen, not heard. Speak only when spoken to.  She  came and sat next to me, maybe for added encouragement but probably to be close enough for a   pop.  I held my breath through most of our sit-  together, closing my lungs from the smoke. I noticed  her feet were swollen; they were fat, and there was no  difference between her ankles and the meaty parts of  her leg. She had on pink house slippers and socks on top  of her stockings. I saw patches of light and dark pigmentation on her legs   like the skin of a dairy cow. Her hair  was always braided except when she got dressed up and  that wasn't often. She wore a printed house dress with a  night shirt on top. Her fingers were short, stubby and  wrinkled with four diamond rings piled on her ring  finger while the rest were bare. Her glasses hung at her  neck, like a necklace, attached to a chain, the frame of  one side held together by masking tape. She'd doze off to  sleep if I sat quietly, but if I took a deep breath, she'd  awaken quickly.  I had to do something. The commercial between the  news and the Reasoner Report seemed prime time to  escape, so at this point I blurted out,  I have to go to the  bathroom.   SHE EXCUSED ME FROM THE ROOM and I left  with the intention of making my short trip as long as  possible. In the bathroom, I found glistening bottles of  cosmetics and red tones of rouge and lipsticks. I inhaled  colognes and toilet waters. I was a grown-up woman  putting on makeup.  The fantasy ended abruptly. I sensed the presence of  Aunt Collester before I saw her image in the mirror;  perhaps I was too successful in my attempt to make my  trip longer, or perhaps the scent of perfume lured Auntie's nose to the bathroom. I looked at the switch in her  hand and burst into tears of fright. I felt pain before the  first lick. But Aunt Collester gave me a forgiving smile  and pointed me out of the bathroom with the switch.  As we ended our story, Auntie said,  See, sweetie, I  wasn't really going to whip you, but I sure did scare you  good. We didn't have no trouble with you that day.   ALL MY LIFE I'VE SPENT much time with Aunt  Collester. I used to be afraid of her: she was a witch in a  haunted house. The rooms were dark and dreary. All the  shelves were dusty   newspapers stacked in corneres,  piled in chairs and under tables   yellow and as old as I  was. I remember her copy of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  and the basement door that opened from the kitchen  floor and the upstairs where old people had died.  Today, the picture hasn't changed much, but my fear  is gone. Her house is historic, like a museum, full of old  and unusual items. I spend hours in this drawer or that  closet or in conversation that explores her years. At my  last visit, we cleaned out a closet and found shoes that  she used to wear, back in style again   by coincidence   my size. I brought home a bag full, like new.  because she had hardly worn them. And before I left, she  gave me her fox coat.  I had the coat cleaned. I got dressed up in it and went  over to Aunt Collester's. When she saw me in her new old  fox coat, she smiled and said,  I always felt elegant in  that fur. Don't you?    Yes,  I answered,  I do feel elegant   just like a real  satin doll.

        <pagetext>Page 6'  WOMANKIND  Willy-nilly the ideas circle,  Discard this one   save that one,  Hope for a miracle.  Decision, where are you?  What can I do? I have a problem,  I must pursue.  What is the answer? The solution? A clue?  BOBBY JEAN HANSEN  Empty Smiles  upside down smiles  falling like webs  on deafened ears.  empty, waiting seats  gape and move.  blatant whispers  search for ears.  time is mine  no laughter aloud  let me escape to  foreign worlds  locked in eoned minds,  time is mine  to be alone in crowds  closing walls  haunt my soul  my back is to the window only.  HA   what a laugh  to see a tear roll  down a softened cheek,  and shaking hands  that grasp and pull.  upside-down  empty smiles  have no meaning.  HENRI MEANS  Sarabande  The young poets around me  hear my address to Death  rejecting  that slow Sarabande.  The ritual mating they understand  will not be Death's but some other's  as if they cling to that roof  peer into that window  chanting and hugging themselves  teetering there on the edge  hooting their  Joy  shouting their  Existence  pushing the slow dance away.  Death would have to be quick  to catch them in their  prancing.  VERSE  FRIENDSHIP IS FOREVER  A soft grey, rainy day,  Made for remembering, made for friends.  Coffee and smokes and familiar jokes,  The comfort of not having to talk,  Or of being repetitious, and still being enjoyed.  A rainy grey mist of togetherness  That borders on, but dares not touch, tenderness.  A pseudo-rough camaraderie, fabricated  To cover the delicate lace of love,  For friendship is forever; love always ends.  We will stay friends.  MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  All Different, Yet The Same  When in the autumn of our lives, we find  The Love supreme; that Love which knows no bounds.  The smallest bird and we share sky and tree;  The hare, the snail and we tread the same grounds,  The largest whale and we swim the same sea.  We breathe the same air; you and I, a King,  The Hottentots. We all are one   one string of DNA  Contorted into odd gene-shapes. On one day,  A Billion billion life forms come to be:  All different, all One. This Love I sing.  MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  Ben Franklin  Said It  First  Love is not diminished by numerous participants:  If I love you, I find it reasonable for you  to love me in return. This does not mean you can't  Love others, too  In loving me, you do not take from them  Any measure of your love for them. Thus, it rings true  That loving others cannot dilute, or weaken,  The fullness of real love I hold for you.  MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  (Mr. Franklin wrote a letter to a young Frenchwoman  along these lines, when he was in his late seventies.)  The  Runner  She wears her scars proudly  for she has earned them in the struggle  that is life and death.  She has been down more than up  unhappy more than happy  unloved more than loved.  She is willing to share the scars  she has earned.  She knows that a bit of experience  can go a long way.  Her eyes no longer reflect the light  of dreams she once had  but rather, of dreams  she has instilled in her children.  Her smile is no longer the carefree  smile she once had  but rather, the smile of a long distance runner.  J.E. MEANS  Haiku  Fair blushing maiden,  With sincerity and grace,  Your loveliness,    keep.  GLORIA JONES  ANITA SPEER SMITH  The Victim  The Bottom Line  I can defy tradition  And revise roles  Make life a circus juggling act  Nurturing my offspring's impressionable souls  While aiming intensely to fulfill my own goals.  I can divvy up diapers  And scullery chores  Be a mason stacking educational bricks  To be levers, forcing open past warped-shut doors.  The price   festering fatigue and emotional sores.  One foot firmly planted  Into each realm  Struggling for balance between two poles  The bittersweet joys of both overwhelm.  Straddling the equator   me, at the helm.  Yet, the day he comes home  And smile s   promotion  My heart packs my bags with mind's mixed emotion  Aspirations demoted to the ranks of seeming notion  Victim of society's still unready potion.  JACQUELYN S. SIBERT  **J  TEMPTATION  Aimlessly, the foul fiend meanders in,  Spotlighted in slick, furry red  Beckoning of demon head,  Subtle nudge of hairy hand,  Horned feelers tune d in quest,  Cloven hooves suspended,  Writhing, giddy tease,  Capricious, enticing dance.  Impetuous switch of blackened tail,  Intimidations   last chance.  Pleading   disguised in ballet, persuasion an agile waltz,  Demands, frenzied prance.  Malice triumphant on ugly features-  Fiery command   Seductive, indiscriminate glance,  Aphrodisiac contortions,  Wicked invitation to sinister choreography plotted  in advance.  v w n;  Behind the passive muscles of her face,  Shining, feral, in close-lidded eyes  A glimpse of who she was  falls  into  place  Like a still-shot, like frozen time and  space.  She is now, as she has ever been,  a human, whole, but boxed in,  cornered in an airless  gloom  Where thought comes hard and mindless  terror stalks.  (It won't happen again, if she hides her face  No, he won't find her in this quiet room  Never again the warm evening walks)  She knows she must always stay here  And no one need know how often she cries  Recalling the days before fear.  I Am Like  Whistler's Mother  I am like Whistler's mother,  Propped up in a high-backed chair,  Dressed in drabbest colors,  Watching what isn't there.  I occupy a quiet gloom  Of drear flat plane and tone,  Sitting off-center in a room,  Dull and monotone.  In this limbo all is dim,  Peaceful, calm, and still.  Life has lost its rhythm,  Passion, wit, and will.  I would scratch the paint that binds me  I would claw the canvas, too;  But I am bound composed rigidly  By art for art's sake and you.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 7  Portrait  Of  An  By J.C. STARKER  Actress  Book Review  Games    Mother  Never Taught You  By  Amber is sending three of her invisible students into  the hall as I enter the paper-cluttered room we share for  a study.   They won't pay attention,  she says with a flip of her  short, tan curls.  I don't know what I'm going to do with  these children.   After I nod my head in sympathy, she does a mad  dance   a cross between the rumba and the jerk   back to  her desk. Then she ignores me, wiggling on her chair to  find that just-right position. As she turns the pages of a  huge anatomy book, she mumbles  stomach ,  heart ,  and  egg  to herself and I know she is pretending to be a  science teacher today.  While she mumbles, I remember that she hasn't  always been a teacher. Yesterday she was the mother of  six wooden babies, living less than an arm's length  away from a three-foot-high doll house her father built  for her. The day before that she successfully cured two  stuffed dogs of a disease I had never heard of. And once  she was a cheerleader. To prove it, she owns a small  trophy topped by a sweater-clad figure of a curvaceous  female holding up two gold pom -poms.   Do you think my breasts are growing?  she suddenly  asks, poking out her flat, seven-year-old chest through  her baggy sweatshirt.  I want to tell her that brains are more important than  breasts, but I hold myself back. It's too easy to say it, so  I must hold back and strain my eyes and pretend that the  dirt growing on her sweatshirt is something else.   A LITTLE BIT. They're growingjust a little bit.  I  say.  Satisfied, she resumes her work, shuffling and reshuffling the piles of books, notebooks, crayon drawings and  pencils on her crowded, disorganized desk. From one of  the six full purses dangling nearby, she pulls out a picture of Donny Osmond and somehow manages to include  him into the science lesson by pointing to parts of his  physique that have come to symbolize the perfect male  for her. Later she sends another child out of the room for  spitting on someone.  ' I didn't see him do anything,  I say.  She stops her class, surprised to find me still in the  room.   Oh, he always spits,  she reluctantly explains.  I  don't have to see him do it.  She quickly puts a mark  beside his name in her gradebook, and I wonder how  many students she pretends are still with us as she reads  off the homework assignment. Her slender hands, still  brown from summer, point and gesture, mimicking the  hands of women who have stood in front of her at some  time. She has always been an actress...always.   What do you want to be when you grow up?  I ask,  sitting down.  She takes off the purple sunglasses she wears when  she is Mrs. Carey, the teacher, and glares at me for interrupting the class.   Artist,  she says.  I already told you that before.   She turns away, but then remembers something.  And I  wajit to be a veterinarian, too.   I SCRIBBLE her words down in my journal and re-  ber that she collects pictures of dogs. She has always  loved animals. She nearly loved a dog, a guinea pig and  two cats to death before they could be found suitable  homes. She has never been able to understand why  animals   or people   will not always do what she wants  them to. But her world, in which imagination often plays  God, does not limit her to living things or to paper cut-outs.  She developed a love, at one time, for a dead bird she  named Lucky and for a decaying mouse she found frozen  outside. I discovered the mouse in her chest-of-drawers  before she had time to name it.   Germs,  she shouted when I scolded her and warned  about disease,  I didn't see no germs on it.   She finishes straightening her desk for the third time  and dismisses the class for the day. She sighs as though  a great responsibility has left her and removes her purple sunglasses. She leaves me then, but returns later  dressed in the Raggedy Ann costume I made her to wear  last Halloween.  Can I paint my face?  she asks, rubbing the dye  from the costume onto my paper.   NO,  I ANSWER. SHE SHRUGS and starts to leave,  but I want her to stay.  How was school today?   Again she shrugs her bony shoulders and I wait.  Whatever she tells me won't be a direct answer to my  question. Those kind of answers are too easy and bore  her. She leans against my desk and stares at the wall for  a moment.   You know my mood ring,  she finally says. I nod  yes.  Well, every time I get around a boy I like it turns  purple. But even when I get around some boy I say I  don't like, it still turns purple. I think I lie to myself.   She throws herself into a fit of giggles but stops long  enough to tell me she has Kenny D's phone number.   I thought you loved Mike,  I say.   Oh, him,  she says squinching up her face.  I don't  love him anymore.   SHE HALF-LIES ACROSS MY DESK, swinging her  ruffled bottom, balancing herself on one foot. Her amber-colored eyes begin to thoughtfully study her chewed  off fingernails.   Dad was going to take me swimming this afternoon,  but he didn't,  she says.  Clay kept screaming for a  fireman's hat.  She bites a nail.  I hate him. He spoils  everything.   He's your brother and he's just a baby,  I remind her.   Besides, you've done a bit of screaming yourself.   She groans and contorts her small oval face into a yuk.   I wish I never had a brother.  She daydreams and finds  another nail to chew.   Can I wear all your make-up tomorrow?  she asks.   I only have lipstick,  I tell her. She makes her yukky  face again and looks at me in partial disgust.   Aunt Vicki has lots of stuff.  She starts to leave, but  turns back to me with another question.  If I made all  A's on my report card this year, what would you do?    I TRY TO CATCH UP WITH her fleeting thoughts, but  I am caught   a woman in the midst of identifying herself   wondering who this small actress will choose to  copy next. She is an artist of many faces, yet fragile and  new with the skill she practices. Her world was created  within mine, but enlarges daily, feeding on thoughts I  have long since discarded. I can only direct her with the  most gentle caution for I dare not force her, at so tender  an age, to choose between my small world and her own  expanding one.   I know what you'd do if I got all A's,  she says with a  squeal.  You'd go wild.   Then she leans on me quickly, pressing that illusive affection of her world against my shoulder, but before I  can steal a moment's worth of love, she is gone, flipping  a cartwheel out the door and rolling down the hallway.  Betty Lehan Harragan  Information Needed  For Book On  Lesbians   Alcoholism  I am writing a book on lesbians and alcoholism     the first of it's kind. Would like to talk to lesbians  who are recovering from alcoholism about their experiences, friends or lovers of lesbian alcoholic  women who are working with recovering alcoholics  either in treatment centers or therapy programs,  especially those which are lesbian or feminist  oriented. A specific focus of the book will be the  health aspect of alcoholism   both the physical and  mental   positive and negative: experiences and/or  resources are needed.

A rt Exhibit May 6   31  The Woman's Touch, Inc, 6352 W. 37th St., Indianapo  lis, will feature the art of Ms. Cheryl Bopp, opening May  6 and closing on May 31. Ms. Bopp, an Indiana artist, has  shown her work in other one-woman shows in Madison,  Wise, St. Louis, Missouri, as well as a number of cities  in Indiana.  'The subject of Ms. Bopp's art includes many  people and events from her own life. She refers to her  work as documentaries in that it constitutes a documentary of her life and family.  MS. BOPP SEES THE BASIC STRUCTURE of her  work as round, while the themes of that roundness include fantasy, autobiographical ideas, time, life's  essence and women's role.  All that I have been around  is round and curves   roads curve   no severe corners,  curved wheat fields, feathery hills   subtle textures of  corn and soy and of course big skies.    Mountains would have been too powerful   beyond  humanness   but the hills of Indiana   soft like my  mother...nothing sever or angular about her,  Ms. Bopp  states.  The Woman's Touch, Inc. is a bookstore and personal  growth center which encourages women to express their  womanhood through the arts.     Book Review by Roberta Broderick    Women are unequal to men in the business world. Not  because of less intelligence, energy, ability, or  dedication, but simply because they have no idea of how  to play the game, a game that men have been playing in  one form or another since boyhood.  So says Betty  Lehan Harragan in her book, Games Mother Never  Taught You (Corporate Gamesmanship for Women).  Since the early 1970's, a series of judicial decisions have  established equal enforceable work opportunities for  women and hundreds of women are pouring into the  work force, intent on making their way to the top. Yet  businessmen are adamant that women  don't have what  it takes.  They say qualified women either do not exist  or do not apply for top level jobs. The word  qualified,   a mathematical X, as she puts it, is what intrigues Ms.  Harragan. The purpose of the book is to isolate that X  factor so that a career woman can begin to compute her  future chances using the same elements as her male  colleagues.  The existing system is the game of business, and unfortunately most women are unprepared for and  oblivious to the rules of the playing field they are thrust  onto.  The rules have been established by male WASP founders and Ms. Harragan points out many of these rules.  She observes the special language men know and use.  She records the traditional feminine attitudes that handicap women. She notes the effects of symbolism, sex,  dress and deportment. She discusses secrets to success  that we don't want to know, truths that aren't fair and  equal, and traps to beware of that can be encompassed  in the word  feminine.   Yet Ms. Harragan feels this is a game women can win,  and armed with their intuition, sensitivity, and ability to  feel and understand these basics, they can play the  game extremely well. As in any game, perfection comes  only with practice, and women at this point in time,  stand to be wonderful players. Ultimately, when they get  to be dealers, they can exercise the prerogative to  change the rules, but until then, this book might serve as  a guide to corporate gamesmanship as it is today.

        <pagetext>Page 8  WOMANKIND     I il IIIfiA  '    * Ironing Boart  by PAT HEIDENREICH  Get Lost, Bunny   I've had it with the Easter bunny  I've decided one of  us has got to go. I can't take one more year of squashed  chocolate, broken egg shells and smashed jelly beans.  And strands of that darned plastic grass are shining and  glittering from every nook and cranny of the house.  It's the same old thing year after year. The Easter  bunny comes in through an open window, spilling jelly  beans in the yard and leaving a trail all through the  house. He colors eggs with the name of each member of  the family on one of them and arranges them in a bowl  on the kitchen table. Then the little rascal hides the  baskets. And every year he puts one of them in the  clothes dryer. What a drag  No originality   AND EVERY YEAR THE KIDS GET UP at 4 or 4:30  and tramp on the jelly beans in their mad search for the  baskets. By the time Roquespiere and I roll out, most of  the candy has been eaten and the baby has a tummy  ache.  Sunday night after the kids turned in, Roques and I  collapsed in exhaustion. I was in my favorite spot...on  the couch and he was slumped in a chair, his legs stretched out in front of him.   Something's burning,  he said, as he sniffed the air  suspiciously.   Check your cigarette in the ashtray,  I mumbled.  ffMy gosh, there's an egg yolk on fire     Well, at least that's one that's not crumbled and  ground into the furniture.    Why is it that out of four kids, not one of them will eat  the yolks?    I don't know, but I think I'm laying in a bed of salt.    How many more years of this do we have to go  through?    Well, the baby just turned four, so we've got a few  more.    I don't think I can take it any more.    I don't either. Do you think the kids would believe it it  we told them the Easter bunny got run over by a truck  and will never return?    No.    How about if we tell them he freaked out on egg dye  and will never return.    It's worth a try,  he said as he walked to the bedroom  and skidded on a marshmallow chicken.

Blow less than   20 on four or five bottles of one or two types  of wine plus some hearth rolls with butter to  nibble between sips and you've got the  makings of a party for ten or a dozen friends.  And don't worry about not having proper  wine glasses; use disposable plastic tumblers and you won't have to wash anything.  (Get clear ones so you can appreciate the  colors of the wines.)  A recipe requiring red wine covers a  lot of territory, so lets narrow it down a bit.  One of the best known is Chianti; you find it  served with Italian food and it often comes in  fiascos with cute little baskets. These make  great candle holders. Check your grocery  shelves and you'll find several brands of  Chianti and its cousin, Paisano. I like both of  these from that California winery operated  by two Italian brothers; they know what  they're doing. I hate being coy about brand  names, but I've noted that no other columnist  mentions brands, so I'd better not either. Incidentally, it's pronounced key-ountay; not  chant-ey.  A HEAVIER DRY RED WINE that goes  luxuriously with steak, roast beef or even  hamburgers royale is Burgundy. There's  plain Burgundy and a marvelous California-  bred Hearty Burgundy that some famous  gourmets rated better than French imports  in a blindfolded taste test. You might want to  add Beaujolais, Zinfandel, Pinot Noir or  Claret to the red wines at your party. Those  are the names of the grapes used for the wine  and each is a different flavor. Look around,  try a little something new. I love Mountain  Red Claret, but my husband thinks it should  have been left in the hills. To each his own.  What goes with what? When in doubt, serve  Rose. There is a dandy new Red Rose on the  market that tastes right with just about  everything from crackers before dinner to  chicken or beef and on into pound cake for  dessert. I love it, but be warned, it's easy to  drink to much of this one. There are some  tasty dry rose wines from New York state  and if you want to drop  5 on a single bottle,  there's a rose in a brown opaque bottle and a  cheaper one in a green semi-curved bottle,  both imported from Portugal and both marvelous. The bottom-heavy green bottle  makes a great book end when filled with  sand.  Which lead us into the white wines. There's  Liebfraumilch, pure white and lightly sweet,  one brand comes in a bottle you might want  to make into a lamp base. If you're having  chicken or fish or other white meat (such as  veal), a white wine is delicious. These range  from sweet, such as Rhine Garten to dry,  Photo by Pat Watson  such as Sauterne with a lot of stops in between. Take a sampling of Green Hungarian  Wine from California, Riesling, Chablis,  Pinot Chardonnay, or even Moselle. For  3 or   4 a bottle, you can gamble a little   and if  you don't like it, someone at your party will.  CHICKEN AND VEAL basted or poached in  white wine are delicious; and, as the alcohol  evaporates during cooking, you can have the  flavor without the calories. Try this one:  place cut up fryer pieces in a shallow  casserole, pour a cup or so of any white wine  over it (the finished flavor will vary with the  wine, but they all taste good.) Sprinkle with a  little paprika to give it a pretty color, cover  and bake at 325 for 1 to iy2 hours. If you have  mushrooms handy, you can add them too.  Serve with rice or rolls and your favorite  vegetable. Chill the remaining wine and  drink with dinner.  In addition to the plain wines, there are  sparkling wines   Champagne, Sparkling  Burgundy, Cold Duck   and the fortified  wines   port, sherry, tokay, madeira and  muscatel. Fortified wines are strengthened  by adding brandy or spirits. They carry  about 20  alcohol (40 proof) while simple  wines have about 10 to 14  because the rising  alcohol content kills the yeast and stops the  fermentation process as the wine is being  made. Remember there are some cough  syrups that carry that much alcohol as a  preservative.  Don't ever blush at serving American wine  instead of imported. European wines  vary   even from the same vineyard   from  year to year depending on the weather;  whereas California wines don't even need  vintages labeled because they remain the  same year after year.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 9  Not So Far  College     Sponsors      Essay      Contest  After Al  BY  JOYCE MCDONALD  I remember an old maiden aunt of my mother's who  used to come to our house for extended visits. She was  forever lifting her hair from the back of her neck and  fanning with her handkerchief while exhaling a loud   whew . She would then laugh softly, and I would observe as knowing glances passed between Mother and  Aunt Margaret. I felt slightly left out as I often did when  adults spoke in almost embarrassed tones about things  that they shared an understanding for but which were  just beyond my grasp. I had a vague idea that they  shared a secret that someday I would also be a part of. I  longed for that magical time in my life to arrive when I  would be considered one of the ladies and no longer  thought of as a child.  By the time I was ready to enter the ranks of  womankind, the sexual revolution had won most of its  battles, and a new openness had replaced the idea of  secrecy and being special that I had looked forward to  sharing with other women. Now the attitude was that,  biologically speaking, there was nothing overwhelming  about the menses or any other female biological process.  As a modern American woman I accepted my feminine  physiology and psychology as something special but not  as something secret. I looked upon my monthly menstrual periods not as a curse but as a fact of life. I suffered little discomfort and was sure that the reason for  other's sufferings was in their old fashioned attitudes  about such things.  I ENJOYED THE LUXURY of being given choices  about my life and my body and along with the rest of the  females of the sixties, considered the PILL to be at least  as great a medical achievement as the discovery of  penicillin. Once again, however, I was to learn that things  are not as they seem. Ironically it was no longer menstruation that was considered to be a curse, but the very  thing that had guaranteed sexual freedom was now, like  so many things we had long enjoyed, found to be hazardous. How to enjoy sexual openness when one was constantly haunted by the fear of unwanted pregnancy  became the problem of the day.  The technology of space age humankind once again  met the challenge by presenting us with some new alternatives. My family having reached the desired size, I  took advantage of the scientific marvel of the laser  beam and with fewer complications than would have resulted from a dental extraction, rid myself of the need  to worry about contraception.   And she lived happily ever after...  Not quite. For  some mystical reason I am one of those marvelously  lucky women to whom menopause comes early. Did I  say lucky? At the age of 33 I finally became fully aware  of the meaning of Aunt Margaret's ritual with the hair  and the handkerchief. Perhaps the reader has noticed  how I timed this chapter of my life to coincide with  the publication of a multitude of articles proclaiming the  dangers or hormone shots and the declaration that  today's woman needs no artificial help in dealing with  this change in her body chemistry. Being a modern  woman, I take a certain amount of pride in being able to  say that in the last two years I have learned to carry a  handkerchief with me at all times and have devised fifty  different ways to comment on how overheated so many  of my friends' homes are. Aunt Margaret would be  proud of me. I have arrived, but it was a much shorter  trip than I expected.  BABSON PARK, Mass-Babson College is sponsoring  a nation-wide contest to stimulate development of a  program to help homemakers achieve equitable treatment.  The Edward L. Bernays Foundation Award of  3,000  will be presented to the winning contestant who must  write, in 5,000 words or less, a practical format aimed at  solving problems of inequities in law and economics affecting the nation's homemakers.

        <pagetext>Page 10  WOMANKIND  Women in Soaps  by MARY CRISLER  Until four years ago, I was employed full-time and was  not able to watch daytime television. One day after my  retirement, I was watching the Mike Douglas Show  when a comedian, who had played a part on the daytime  serial,  Days of Our Lives,  gave a short synopsis of the  story. It was hilariously funny the way he narrated it;  and I decided to start watching the program. It takes  only a short time, probably about one week, to become  involved with the story and to wonder what is going to  happen next to the characters portrayed.  Many people are ashamed to admit that they're  hooked on daytime television serials. There's an old  stigma attached to anyone who becomes involved with  the soaps. After I started talking about watching  Days  of Our Lives,  I was surprised to learn that some of my  friends and acquaintences were also watching this  program as well as other daytime serials. I became interested in the history of soap opera and in trying to  determine why this entertainment is so popular.  SOAP OPERA IS ONLY about fifty years old. It began  in Chicago during the very late twenties and very early  thirties. Radio had only been in existence in any real  sense since 1920, when KDKA, Pittsburgh, carried the  Harding-Cox election returns. Music, sermons,  prizefights, and political speeches were all evening  programs; but the daytime air was a radio wasteland,  with  Live Stock Reports,   Our Daily Food,   Mouth  Hygiene,  and  Beautiful Thoughts.   James Thurber did research on the soaps. He located  an old-time announcer, Norman Brokenshire, who had  been responsible for filling a free half-hour of air time  with some kind of variety show. The actors who had  promised to perform were late and the announcer started reading a short story from a book which was lying on  a studio table. When the promised performers appeared, the announcer discontinued his reading so that  they could take over the remainder of the program. The  next day, the studio had received hundreds of letters  from listeners who wanted to hear the end of the story.  Mr. Brokenshire believed that he had discovered the  audience for the new art form, the soap opera.   The Smith Family,   Amos 'n Andy,   Lum and  Abner,   Moonshine and Honeysuckle,   The Goldbergs,   Clara, Lu 'n Em,  and  Vic and Sade  were  programs which were the forerunners of the tru soap  opera. They contained many of the elements of soap  opera; however, they also contained comedy of a comic  strip character.  SOAP OPERAS ARE STORIES about American  domestic life. The principal characters are middle-  class, not poverty-stricken or of great wealth, neither  ignorant nor well educated. They are people with whom  the audience is supposed to be able to identify.  The first radio soaps started during the Depression,  when women had hard lives. Time-saving appliances  were not yet available; often there were more children  than could be properly taken care of; divorces were  looked down upon and sometimes, if considered, could  not be afforded; and men were the undisputed masters  of their homes.  Radio soaps were very important to the housewife. All  soaps claimed to be  true to life.   Ma Perkins  was  broadcast daily for twenty-seven years'from 1933 to I960.  Her creators made her appear as a young vital genius in  the person of an old, folksy lumberyard owner who  baked pies for her workers and solved many problems  for everyone.  The Romance of Helen Trent  was about  a 35-year-old woman who had romance and no husband,  no children, and no drudgery. These portrayals were  real enough for the listeners to identify with and to feel  that they possibly might be able to live in the same way.  Irna Phillips was considered the  Queen of Soap  Opera.  She was an Ohio schoolteacher, who in 1930 was  hired by Chicago's WGN to write the first daytime serial  for women,  Painted Dreams.  This was about the  problems of the Moynihans. The main character,  Mother Moynihan, was the Irish mother of a large  family. Those who knew Miss Phillips thought that  Mother Moynihan was modeled after her own mother,  and was the source of inspiration for many of her  characters.  For more than forty years, until her death in 1973, Irna  Phillips had a successful career which included both  radio and television writing. In her writing,  the endurance and sanctity of the family was the most important element.  She was the first writer to use organ  music as a way of setting a mood and bridging breaks in  the narrative, and the first one to employ doctors, nurses, schoolteachers, and ministers as her main characters. It is said that she also was the first writer to have  won the label  soap opera  for one of her creations  sponsored by Procter and Gamble, a soap company  which was thereafter to sponsor innumerable other  daytime serials.  MISS PHILLIPS WAS ASKED HOW a woman who had  never married nor ever had a family of her own could  have portrayed family life and romantic problems so  well. She admitted that she wrote from her observations  of other people. She was interested in talking to those  with whom she came in contact, including the  milkman or newspaper boy, about their problems. She  estimated that her lifetime writing would have been  equal to twenty-five hundred average-size novels.  When Miss Phillips started writing for radio she  wrote all of her own dialogue. Later, she hired writers to  help. Agnes Nixon was one of the writers hired by Irna  Phillips. She had just finished college and was ambitious  to become a writer. In 1946, it was a profession difficult  to make a living in   as it always had been and probably  always will be. Ms. Nixon had had one job offer, from  her father, to work for him in the burial-garment  business. She insisted that she could make a living as a  writer and wanted the chance to prove it. Her father did  not heartily agree, but did make inquiries among his  friends so that she could have an interview with someone  in the writing business. She took along a script of a play  she had written when she went for the interview with the  professional writer. After Irna Phillips finished reading  the script of the play, she asked the young author if she  would like to work for her.  Today, Agnes Nixon is still writing for soap operas. After six months working in Chicago, she moved to New  York for personal reasons, one of which was that her  father was distressed  over her life as a writer and independent (from him) career woman.  She also thought  that since many of the radio serials were moving to New  York, this would be the best place to go. She wrote for  soaps as well as dramas for the live television shows   Studio One,   Robert Montgomery Presents,    Somerset Maughan Theater,   Philco Theater,  and   Hallmark Theater.    ALL MY CHILDREN  WAS her first  creation  and  her favorite. It is also the favorite of many fans. Ms.  Nixon became a housewife, but not  just a housewife.   She continued writing while having four children.  For  the past 20 years, Agnes has written one or more  daytime serials five days a week, 52 weeks a year.  She  said that she had to give up bridge clubs, ladies' luncheons, and civic work; and that she only attended PTA  or went to see her son and daughters in school sports.  Agnes Nixon is regarded as  The Princess  and  the  heir apparent to Irna Phillips' crown.   In the Soap tradition, this Series is continued.  (Continuedfrom Page4)  ABORTION, THE LAW  The Right to Life stance on abortion remains firm  even in cases where pregnancy has resulted from rape  or incest, for they maintain that exceptions for social  reasons can never be justified when balanced against  the life of the fetus. Further, they insist that pregnancy  resulting from rape is rare stating that  ...of every 100  GENUINE rapes, only two to four result in pregnancy.   They maintain that by making an exception in the case  of rape society is not focusing on the true problem of  providing humane treatment for the victim and apprehension of the rapist, but rather are attempting an  apology to the victim by allowing her to abort and forcing her to deal with the double trauma of rape and abortion. They also cite opposition to such an exception  would come from police and other law enforcement officials because such an exception would require proof of  rape.  It is the belief of the Right to Life movement that the  Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade has denigrated  the rights of the unborn child based on a nebulous right  of privacy not actually protected by the constitution and  is a sanction of immorality in American society. They  further believe that a  constitutional amendment is  required to restore integrity to American law and make   the American legal system once more the guarantor  and protector of all human rights and the human rights  of all.  Accordingly, it would appear that their dogma  confers upon the state a compelling, legitimate interest  in the woman's right to abortion and the right to legislate  against abortion for it assumes that the function of the  law is to protect the community and fetal rights would  necessarily come under this mantle of protection. They  fear that if this is not accomplished liberal abortion under the law will undermine American society by  creating a social climate wherein sexual immorality  runs rampant and the value of human life becomes extinct. In such a moral climate they envision abortion  becoming a tool for social engineering eliminating the  poor, the unfit and unwanted minority groups. They  argue that legalized abortion is based upon the premise  that society has the right to rid itself of a problem by  eliminating a problem child. As an adjunct to this  argument they insist that abortion rests not on principles of freedom and equality but discrimination and  utility and as such sets a precedent for legalized social,  economic and political use of murder to eliminate unwanted elements of American society. In support of this  they quite often turn to events that took place in Nazi  Germany to illustrate that human power over life is immoral and that once such a power is established it  becomes contagious and legal safeguards disintegrate.  ALTHOUGH PUBLIC OPINION  POLLS would indicate that the Right to Life position may be a minority  position in the United States, their hardline stance, tactics bordering on the fanatical and strong lobbying force  have   brought  them   important  victories   in   the  legislature. Although they have not brought about the  passage of a constitutional amendment to date, there  have been Senate judicial hearings to consider the  passage of such an amendment and as of July, 1977,  eight states including the stae of Indiana have passed  resolutions calling for Congress to convene a constitutional convention for the express purpose of considering an amendment to the constitution that would  forbid abortion. Further, they assume credit, and apparently justifiably so, for the recent controversy over  the availability of Medicaid funds for abortion for indigent women in Congress which has blocked funding for  the Labor Department and the Department of Health,  Education and Welfare. Outside of the legal arena they  have effectively limited the availability of abortion to  many women by pressuring doctors and hospital boards  to refuse abortion services. Their tactics have, of course, been particularly effective with Catholic doctors and  personnel, even those who believe in the right of choice,  as the threat of excommunication from the church is a  very effective weapon   one that has been recently reinforced by the church on all levels for those Catholics who  participate in aboriton in any way even at the level of  abortion counseling.  To determine whether the Right to Life position on  abortion is valid within the context of the law and its  place in society it is necessary to examine not only the  law in relationship to morality as determined by  theological precepts, but also the civil rights of the  citizen to privacy and equality and the effect the  changes in the law they propose would have on society as  a whole.  IT WOULD APPEAR THAT morality is not always the  primary impetus for legislative action. Although moral  standards are relevant to the law and laws may be  promulgated that reflect the moral standards of  society, criteria for the law should be based upon not  only a consensus as to what moral standard for the  society should be (without undue influence from a particular church's theological precepts) but also upon  utilitarian considerations in the context of which the  welfare of the members of society are considered.  It is impossible using this criteria to affirm the  position of the Right to Life movement as valid for they  have established a moral absolute, the sanctity of embryonic and fetal life and that abortion is termination of  life unlawfully, based upon the theological precepts of a  particular religion. They have used moral absolute as a  basis for law without consideration as to whether a  moral consensus exists, which it apparently does not, or  to the welfare of the members of society. Where  theological precepts are not universally accepted in a  society and a moral consensus does not exist they cannot  be validly used as criteria for promulgation of law for  such law would unduly discriminate against the citizens  of the society and quite possibly lead to legal chaos.  Since the position of the Right to Life groups cannot be  separated from the theological precepts of the Roman  Catholic Church, if American society would allow law to  be promulgated by amendment to the constitution that  would impose these beliefs upon all citizens, regardless  of their personal beliefs, we would be seriously jeopardizing the right of all citizens to freedom of religion  which is guaranteed by the 1st Amendment to the Constitution. Furthermore, theological speculations as to  the moment when life begins and whether abortion is  immoral according to their tenets have no place in the  formulation of law, particularly criminal law, for they  would be imposed upon believers and non-believers  alike. Law in a society such as ours which is based upon  separation of church and state and encompasses a  myriad of religions and religious philosophies must,  always be based upon criteria that is civil and not upon  the religious tenets of a particular religion such as  Roman Catholicism.  THIS   WELL-RESEARCHED   ARTICLE   WILL   BE  CONTINUED IN OUR NEXT ISSUE.  How Will You Feel on  March 23,1979 if the  Equal Rights Amendment  is not Passed?

In any circumstance, you can change your name  in two ways. No court action is required.  An individual can file a petition (fill out a simple form)  with the Marion Country Circuit Court, first floor, City-  County Building. A clerk will help, if necessary. An Indiana Supreme Court Ruling states that a name change  should be granted automatically if there is no suspicion  of intent to defraud. (This process may also be done for  you by an attorney, but it is not required.)  You can also change you name by consistent use of  another name. First, change the name on your insurance policies, bank accounts, charge accounts and on any  property held. You need not produce any documents or  proofs. Next, contact the Social Security Administration  and the Department of Motor Vehicles and request  issuance of a new card and license.  IF YOU EXPECT TO NEED A PASSPORT, you may  need to consider that it must be issued in the name you  have used consistently for at least the past year. Keep  records of when you initiate your name change.  The major legal consideration in name change is consistent usage with no intent to defraud. Not correcting  someone's error in casual conversation (i.e. someone introduces you in your husband's surname when it's not  your legal name) would not be breaking the consistency  rule.

BOX   :  lt;)       BERKELEY, CA. 94709  Dear Sister,  We are writing to invite you to join the Feminist Writers' Guild. We  are forming this organization to act as both a service group and a  political body for feminist writers.  As women writers in an inhospitable culture, without each other's  support we are at the mercy of our own self-doubt. One priority of the  Guild is to develop grassroots writing communities through its local  chapters, eventually forming a visible, national network. By  organizing on the local level, we hope to break our isolation through  groups that act as a professional support, a political catalyst, and a  source of friendship.  As a service organization, the Feminist Writers' Guild will assemble a handbook containing a list of minimal rights and percentages,  standard contracts, and a guide to reading them. A file on feminist  editors, agents and presses will be compiled, and a newletter will  provide information about publishing, grants, and Guild activities.  Eventually, we hope to provide insurance and even a retirement plan  for members. We would also like to found a rural retreat for women  writers and their children. Finally, the Guild, working through its  local chapters, will encourage the growth of community among  feminist writers.  Originally, the idea for the Guild came from efforts to combat the  current backlash against femimism in the partriarchal press. At the  present time, this backlash is, if anything, increasing. Among the  most serious threats to our livelihood as writers are the reviews of  feminist works which are so seriously biased that they distort the  content of the books. (Publicity for a book can be dropped and  distribution curtailed because of a negative review in The New York  Times, for instance.) Many reviewers have refused even to enter into  reasonable dialogue with feminist ideas.  As a political body, one of the actions of the Feminist Writers'  Guild, when we have raised the funds, will be to take out an ad in a  major review publication; this ad will point out the review bias  against feminism. We will also publically protest the small number of  grants and prizes given to women each year; we will encourage the  creation of grants for the special needs of women, such as childcare.  We will pressure publications with national distribution to review  books by feminist presses, and we will work to promote small press  distribution. We will work against the suppression of writing by  lesbians. In addition, we will use whatever leverage we gain as a  national organization to open up more places for feminist writing by  both white and Third World women. On the local political level, Guild  chapters will pressure their city and campus newspapers to review  the more feminist books.  The Guild is currently under the direction of a Temporary Steering  Committee.  The membership fee is  10 a year ( 5 for the unemployed). The  Guild will include memers with various feminist points of view and  will avoid factionalism. A feminist writer need not make her living  solely by writing in order to be eligible for membership; the Guild is  open to any woman writer who takes her writing seriously. Supporting, non-participatory memberships of  10 are also available to  women who are not'writers. If you know an interested woman who  may not have received this letter, please share yours. Gift memberships of  10 are available, if you wish to pay for a friend. Feminist  organizations (e.g., presses, publications, literary ag; encies,  women's studies programs) may join for  20. In joining, please print  clearly your name, address, and telephone number. Checks should be  made out to The Feminist Writers' Guild and sent to the address  above.  The following are a few of the writers who have already joined the  Guild. We invite you to join us.

Dear Judith, Mary, and others at Womankind,  To the Editors of Womankind,  womankind appreciates you   '**,  V     v,  0,    a *       0    cfe    1     ' *.    gt; lt;v  I have enjoyed receiving the first couple  of issues of WOMANKIND and am looking  forward to the next one. I teach eighth  grade English and while I do not have  much time to join and participate overtly  in the women's movement, I feel very  much attuned to the needs of all of us. Indianapolis has long needed a publicaton  such as yours and I hope that it'continues  for a long time to come.  Sincerely yours, Joyce McDonald, Indpls.  Please send me a sample first issue of  your magazine as advertised in Off Our  Backs. Thank you.  Yours   truly,   Charlotte  M.   Dorusak,  Rockaway, N.J.  We recently received your form letter  urging our subscription to WOMANKIND.  In that letter you indicated that a sample  copy of the paper had previously been  sent to us. Apparently our sample copy was  either not received or has been misplaced  in our office. Could you please send us  another copy for the instructors here to  review and approve.  Sincerely, Sally Heinen, Women's Studies  Department Metropolitan State College  Denver, COL.  I attended a Poetry Reunion Class last  Friday night and Mary Walker was also in  attendance. Mary passed around sample  copies of your Issue 2 of WOMANKIND.  She talked about your publication and I  asked her if I might have a copy of it to  study. After perusing this publication, I  decided it has a lot to offer women. I  decided I would like to try a 1 year subscription. Enclosed is my check for  5.00  Bobby Jean Hansen Indianapolis  We wish you all the luck in the world on  your new venture and will try to help in  any way.  Sincerely, Mrs. Beverly Timberman,  Black  Magazine  Agency,  Logansport, IN  Thank you for sending me a copy of your  Volume I, Issue III, fascinating summation of current woman's scene. In  fact, everything by, or related to, women  has always won my admiration, and it is of  unceasing wonder to me that in this otherwise advanced century some male  chauvinists   doubtless concerned for their  self-assumed but daily disproven  superiorities continue to include women  among the minorities and refer to them indulgently, patronizingly and with  gratuitous kindness rather than meriting  at least equality of consideration.  I gather that your splendidly written and  edited publication essays to correct some of  the wrongs we men have committed  against women through the ages and I  think your fresh and broad-scope and persuasively temperate reformation efforts  are bound to achieve splendid results.  Inevitably, you and other protagonists of  feminine emancipation from the  masculine protectivism or so pretended) are handicapped because so many  women   whatever their brains, their  skills,, their high potentials of achievement  in all fields   seem content with the  Kinder, Kuche, Kirche  role they have long  endured. It has seemed to me that many  women like to be coddled and immunized  from the harsh competitions in the  professions and the marketplace, perhaps  fearing a loss of their very special  femininity and subtle appeals through  outright competition with men for status  and recognition. That must seem to you a  special problem and challenge, along with  a companion tradition that many mediocre  men fear women's continuing advances as  endangering, one of their few claims of  dominance. Maybe WOMANKIND will be  just another voice crying in the wilderness, but you have a worthy cause and a  genuine challenge of an urgent need, and I  hope you and your enthusiastic staff find  tremendous comfort in your dedicated  zeals.  Yours faithfully, G. HURST PAUL  Seattle, Washington  Editors' Note: Bless you and thank you,  my dear Mr. Paul. Your erudite letter  brightened our day and made us feel  grand   On behalf of the residents and staff here  at the Indiana Women's Prison, I would  like to take this time to express our sincere  thanks and appreciation to you.  The newspapers you sent for the ladies  were most welcome. They certainly did  appreciate reading them in their spare  and free time.  Once again, thanks for being so thought  ful  Sincerely,  Patricia  Gray,  Recreation  Director, Indiana State Women's Prison  Indpls., IN  Rather than cut up my copy of  WOMANKIND, I am sending my subscription this way. Please send me the next 11  issues to my home address. Thank you and  much success in the future with your  publication. I will shortly be ordering a  subscription for my office at Indiana State  University, the Women's Resource Center,  so we can turn on Terre Haute.  Sincerely, Yvonne Reed, Terre Haute, IN  I think your newspaper is just great   How in the world did you come up with the  idea of starting it in the first place?

Please note, according to a recent INFACT  bulletin, that the Beech-Nut Foods Corporation  markets only Beech-Nut Baby Foods, so the baby  foods should be boycotted.  On page 3 of Issue 15 of WOMANKIND, please  omit from the Nestle Boycott list:  Beech-Nut Lifesavers  Salvandas Confections  Table Talk Pies  The paper apologizes to the company for this  error in information.  The general boycott of Nestle products continues.

LAWRENCE  . in 1971 we (feminists) were treated with ridicule, now, we have advanced forward and have  the great honor of being treated with hostility.  It's a step forward, I'm telling you,   says  Gloria Steinem to the women and men at the  Indiana Women's Political Caucus luncheon.  (Photo by K. Niles)  In Indianapolis, on October 4, 1980 Gloria  Steinem, co-founder and president of MS  magazine and prominent feminist spokeswoman  stated that the Republican party platform supported the patriarchal authority in the home and  opposed a direct relationship between women and  children and the federal law. Steinem was here  for a pre-election speaking engagement for the  Indiana Women's Political Caucus.   In a press  conference she answered WOMANKIND staff  writer J. R. Lawrence's question concerning the  future of the ERA by replying that if she were  asked for the odds in passing the ERA, she  would say 60-40 in favor of passage of the amendment.   She continued:  ''The fundamental problem is that the state legislatures have not been representative of the states in  which they sit, especially in the conservative state  governments. . I think what is on trial is the state  legislatures and them--not the ERA--and the question of whether they can be democratized quickly  enough.    What is called the Republican platform should  really be called the John Birch Society,   she  explained.    They are against the Equal Rights  Amendment, they are against laws against battered  children, they are against busing, they are against  battered women's centers, they are in favor of the  (Continued to p. 4)  WOMANKIND wants you   WOMANKIND wants to publish YOUR essays, articles, poems, stories, cartoons, graphics, one-  liners, book reviews, etc.  Our only requirement for our contributors is that  they be female.

Johnson, was the guest  speaker at the 25th  anniversary luncheon of the  Indianapolis Women for Better Government organization .   Approximately 120 members and  guests gathered at the Murato Shrine Club  Saturday, September 27, 1980.  Remembered by the mostly mature audience as  a teenager and very young woman during her  White House stay, today Lynda Robb is 36 and  has acquired a long and impressive biography that  includes serving as Vice-President of LBJ Company  and Vice President of Northern Virginia Broadcasting.   Formerly on the staff of McCALLS, she  is now a contributing editor to LADIES HOME JOURNAL.   She is currently on the Board of eleven organizations, in addition to being chairperson of the  President's Advisory Committee on Women.  Twenty-three years old when she married Charles  S. Robb, the present Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, she may be Virginia's first lady at age 37 as  her husband Chuck is expected to run for governor  in the November 1981 election in that state.   The  Robbs have 3 daughters, ages 12, 10, and 2 1/2.  In a soft and slightly southern accent, Robb spoke  to the gathering of her sincere affection for Indiana's  Birch and Marvella Bayh.   In 1964, the Bayhs traveled  throughout the country with Lynda Bird and her sister  Lucy organizing Young Citizens for Lyndon Johnson.  They became very close friends.   Marvella was a very special person. She talked to  me when Chuck decided to run for political office,    Robb said.   Marvella also encouraged Lynda to have  a life of her own:    If something happened to Birch,  I would not only lose my lover and best friend, but  I would lose my own identity, because I am known  as the wife of Senator Bayh,   Marvella said.   It was shortly thereafter,   Robb added,  that  Marvella started getting involved in her own life,  primarily in her involvement with the Cancer Institute.    Echoing Marvella's wisdom, Robb advised:   We women must have something that is 'ours,'  something that makes our own heart sing, not  through someone else.   I am basically a private  person. .. but when I got the request to be the  Chairperson of the Women's Advisory Committee,  I had just received word of Marvella's death shortly  before.   I could not separate the two; it was like  a call from Marvella - a message.    Her voice  quivered, her eyes filled; then Lynda Bird Robb  continued.  When she accepted the position of Chairperson,  she was told it was just a part-time job   just one  day every two months probably.   You've all heard that story before, haven't you    she asked.   Instead, it's been an every day thing. But I consider this something I can do for my country. I can  manage to give 1 1/2 years of my life for this important issue.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  An Admirable Woman  by ROSEMARY  DILLEY  Aunt June was always my dad's beloved  little  sister,  but she was also loved in a very special  way by our whole family.   My three brothers and  I thought her lifestyle was quite glamorous and  we were fascinated by everything she said and did.  When she came to dinner on Sundays and holidays,  we children always gathered around to hear her  tell about her experiences - for June Gray had done  things that few women had done in those days.  Right before World War I, June Gray trained  as a nurse at the Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis in the days when student nurses did everything, including scrubbing floors and plucking  chickens. Each morning, six days a week, the  students rose at 6 A. M. and attended mandatory  chapel services.    Wearing black shoes and black  stockings which were almost hidden by their long  white, stiffly starched skirts, they cared for patients  from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M.   Evening hours were spent  attending classes to prepare them to become registered nurses.  Aunt June's training ended in 1915, and she was  made assistant superintendent of nurses. The following year, she became the superintendent and held  that position until 1917.  June's brother, Lemuel, (my uncle) had joined  the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1916 and  died in France.  Seeking adventure and an opportunity to serve  like her brother, Aunt June enlisted as a Red Cross  nurse, and joined a hospital unit formed by the  Lilly Pharmaceutical Company: Lilly Base Hospital  32, which was originally stationed at the  village of Nancy in northeastern France.   She was  twenty-three.  A supply ship that traveled ahead of the Base  32  group in the early winter of 1917 was sunk by a  German submarine.   Thus, the medical contingent  arrived in France with no duties to perform until replacements were sent from the United States.   This  took several weeks.  During this time, Aunt June and three other nurses  from her unit covered as much of France as they could.  They used whatever transportation was available-,  rickety old railroad coaches or ambulances or whatever.  The air force at that time, was a small group of biplanes that flew observation missions at low altitudes.  We loved to hear her tell about bouncing along bumpy  dusty roads to Contrexeville, France in the sidecar of a  sputtering motorcycle to a tiny airfield where the nurses  would take turns flying with the observation pilots.  After the supplies finally landed, there was a  different kind of excitement as Aunt June assumed  the job of head surgical nurse at the Base  32  hospital in Contrexeville, France under Dr. Edmund  Clark.    She served for more than a year - until the  Armistice of November, 1918.  She came home the following year, but she never  lost her love for France. In later years, she studied  the country and its language hoping that she might  return, but she never did.  In the early 40  I was a high school student; I  expressed a desire to be a nurse until Aunt June  related stories about the things she had done in  surgery in an operating tent only a short distance  behind the front lines.   One of the most sickening  tasks she recalled was to hold up damaged limbs  as they were amputated.    When the limbs swung  free, she had to cast them out of the tent onto a  horrible pile of dead flesh, and blood-stained  bandages that were waiting to be burned.   Her  honesty was very effective--I didn't enter the  nursing profession   After the war, June worked at Methodist Hospital  in Indianapolis for a few years, then allied herself  with the Tuberculosis Association when the drive to  wipe out the  white plague  began in the 1920's.  One of the main thrusts of the T B program was  good nutrition .   My older brothers remember  having publicity pictures taken for the T B  Association eating quantities of green spinach--  appearing rosy-cheeked, but feeling inwardly as  green as the spinach they pretended to eat.  In the early '30's , Aunt June was encouraged by  a group of doctors to open a downtown office to give  x-ray  and ultra-violet treatments to their patients.  Even though this was her main occupation for several  years, she was still associated with the hospital, and,  of course, whenever one of the family had surgery she  was always present.  I remember when I had my tonsils out at the age  of five, she quieted my resistance and escorted me to  the operating room.   Her face was the last one I saw  as I went to sleep and the first to smile at me when  I woke up again.   She was there when we needed her.  In the late *30's, June Gray was able to realize a  life-long ambition.   She closed her office and  attended Butler University as a full-time student.  She was almost forty and rather a novelty in the  classroom at that time, but she earned a B. A. degree,  Magna Cum Laude.   I was in high school at that time,  and her achievement was a source of pride and encouragement to me.   It showed me that education  was its own reward and not just a means to an end.  Aunt June never married.   My mother told us that  she had been engaged to a French doctor who was  killed during the war.   We were firmly told not to  question her about it.   As a child, this seemed very  romantic to me  For several years in the post -war period, she lived  with a friend, Lefa Nida.   When her middle-aged  friend married, Aunt June was begged by both the  bride and her rather elderly groom to share their  large old-fashioned home.   She accepted their  offer.  (Continued to p. 4)  Election Results   . y.

But, that's exactly what will happen unless women  mobilize their talents, skills, money, and energy.  The polls were hardly closed when leaders of the  Radical Right were reading the election results as  a mandate for a return to the simpler, darker days  when women knew their place.   Those who oppose  equal rights for women were claiming that the election represented a mandate against the ERA.   Those  who opposed reproductive rights claimed the election  represented a mandate against abortion.  In short, the forces of reaction moved quickly to  read the 1980 elections as a mandate against all the  gains women have worked so hard to win.  There's no mistake about it    The results of the  election hurt the cause of women's rights .   A number  of good friends and close allies in the U. S. Senate and  friends in the House of Representatives were lost. In  some state legislatures, the results were the same.  But we also had some victories. Victories that the  National Organization for Women helped make possible through the NOW Political Action Committee.  In Rhode Island, pro-choice candidate, Claudine  Schneider, defeated  pro-life  leader Edward Beard  for Congress.  In Pennsylvania, pro-choice Arlen Specter defeated  the anti-choice candidate Pete Flaherty for the U. S.  Senate.  In Oregon and Maryland, pro-choice Senators Bob  Packwood and Mac Mathias prevailed against campaigns by the  right-to-life  forces.  Across the country there was plenty of evidence that  the election was not a mandate on the social issues involving women's rights.  In Connecticut, Christopher Dodd won the U. S.  Senate seat over the well-financed and ultra-conservative James Buckley.  In Illinois, Dave O'Neal     the candidate backed  by Phyllis Schlafly, went down to defeat by moderate  candidate Alan Dixon, despite the fact that Ronald  Reagan carried Illinois by a wide margin.  In Massachusetts pro-choice candidates Jim Shannon  and Barney Frank vrete victorious despite massive  efforts by anti-choice forces.  In other states which went heavily for Ronald Reagan,  a number of good friends of NOW and women's rights  were returned to office, including Senator Gary Hart  and Representative Mo Udall.  The fact   of the 1980 elections is that the issue of  women's rights, the ERA, and abortion were not voted  on by the American people.   People voted in protest  to the high level of inflation and unemployment, to  the Mid East situation and against the incumbent  President.  But, now we are faced with a Congress and state  legislatures that are far more conservative than they  were before the election.   And, in all candor, this  makes what was already a difficult task of passing  the ERA even more difficult.  Within hours after the election, the leaders of the  Far Right were proclaiming victory.   And within days,  they had announced their plans for the 1982 elections.  The National Conservative Political Action Committee,  the Pro-life Amendment Committee, the Committee  for the Survival of a Free Congress, Christians for  Reagan     all claimed some special mandate and all  moved immediately to stake their reactionary claims  on the new administration and Congress.  The National Organization for Women has decided  to seize the initiative     to let the Far Right know that  the election was not a mandate for a return to the 18th  century for women and to let Ronald Reagan not forget  the promises he made for  women's rights  and the  fact that the majority of the nation supports the ERA         Beginning with Inauguration Day ERA  supporters and members of NOW from  all across the country will line both  sides of Pennsylvania Avenue, to remind President Reagan of the nationwide support for women's rights.  i Across the country during his term of  office, women and men will continue  to remind the President that more  than 60 percent of the population  favor the Equal Rights Amendment  and more than 70 percent favor reproductive rights.  The President, the Congress, the state legislatures  and the American public must know that those who  Poem by June Gray appeared in 1915 class book.  (Continued to p. 9)

        <pagetext>4.  WOMANKIND  Admirable Woman        Continued from page 3 60   40 for ERA Continued from page 2       Lunch with  Lynda        Continued from page 2  My brothers and I loved to visit the 3 of them,  especially at dinner time - - just to see the maid  hurry in from the kitchen in response to the foot-  buzzer hidden under the dining room table.   The  groom, Mr. Gresham, drove downtown to his  men's club a few evenings each week to play bridge.  We always hugged ourselves with laughter when  the  girls.n as he called June and Lefa, would tell of the  winter night he went to the deep, narrow guest closet  to put on his galoshes in preparation for his outing,  and disappeared head first into the closet as he bent  over to fasten them.   A little later he was discovered  in this pose by  the girls,   and rescued in time to go  downtown as usual, his dignity somewhat restored.   He  was a small, quiet man, and he often entertained my  brothers and me by showing us lovely vases and oriental  pictures that were relics of the years that his father was  ambassador to Japan--I believe during the administration  of Benjamin Harrison.  The only thing we didn't enjoy about staying overnight in that house was my aunt's insistence on what  we considered unnecessary cleanliness.   Her routine  included morning and evening baths for all--whether  we thought we needed them or not   As with most active people, Aunt June sometimes  needed to be alone.   A cabin in Brown County, Indiana  was her retreat.   That cabin was the one possession she  had that was entirely her own.   She had purchased it  with her government bonus, received by World War I  veterans in the mid-thirties.   First, she bought the land,  then she purchased an old cabin back in the hills which  was numbered piece by piece, and then disassembled,  and moved to her own land.   In those days, Nashville,  Indiana was primarily an artists' colony with none of  the commercial aspects it has today. She loved the  serenity of the pokey little town and spent most of  the glorious fall season there whenever she could.   We  were allowed to take turns visiting her occasionally,  but my father insisted that her privacy be respected  even when we begged to go more often.  The first thing to be done on arrival was to pick  up a few five gallon bottles at the cabin and go to  the town pump in Nashville to fill them with drinking water.   No one was ever to drink from the cistern -fed pump in the cabin kitchen.   Another shorter  trip was to the outhouse down the hill to see if any  chipmunks had taken up residence there.   Aunt  June called the outhouse  the Eleanor  because  Mrs. Roosevelt had promoted the idea that  concreted ased facilities were more sanitary  and the government had provided plans for  building these rustic models of non-plumbing.  I don't remember the riding stable on the  main street in Nashville, but my older brother,  Bill, likes to talk about the pleasure he and June  shared when they rented horses there to ride up  and down the hills of Brown County back in the  '30's.  My memory is still stirred by the day in June,  1941 when were wondering how to celebrate Aunt  June's upcoming birthday.   We knew she was ill,  but in the way of teen-agers, we thought she  would surely be well enough to come to dinner  next week on her forty-seventh birthday.   The  phone rang.   It was Dad, his  little sister  was  dead.   A sudden heart attack had taken her away  from us, so swiftly that it seemed impossible    I  still recall the sadness I felt as taps marked her  burial at Crown Hill Cemetery.   Because of the  encouragement and inspiration she provided us as  we were growing up, she will always be remembered  by our family.  I am proud that June Gray's name is on the roll  of the Women's Overseas Service League, a  national organization founded by the women who  went to France during the war  to end all wars, to  commemorate their sisterhood of service.   In the  Indiana War Memorial, on the wall of the west  staircase, her name is listed among the veterans  of World War I.   She lived and died a member of  an honored company who gave of themselves to  serve humanity, but to my brothers and me, she  was our Aunt June, a warm beloved woman.

Though not endorsing Carter, Steinem told a  press conference she planned to cast her vote for  the President, feeling that he at least is a person  with whom women can work.  Ms. Steinem also spoke glowingly of Indiana's  Birch Bayh, Democratic senator, as  a person for  whom we can work wholeheartedly for.   (Bayh  was defeated in his run for a 4th term by Dan  Quayle in the recent election.)  Later addressing a luncheon in her honor, Steinem  spoke at length of the similarities of the extreme  right republican stance of the Reagan platform and  Hitler's rise to power.   She pointed out that a good  example of this analogy is the Republican's stand  on reproductive rights, explaining that when Hitler  came to power, one of his first acts was to close the  abortion clinics, ending what Hitler called the  ridiculous idea that women control their own bodies.    (See the October issue of MS.) In addition, she  noted that Reagan's authoritarian ultra right wing  was counting on the majority of women voters not  using their right to vote.    They are depending on  us staying home... otherwise, if more go to the  polls, they cannot win.    WOMANKIND staff writer J. R. Lawrence chats  with Gloria Steinem during her pre-election stopover in Indianapolis.    We receive WOMANKIND  at our office,   said Steinem.  (Photo by Claudia Davis)  How Women Voted  For the first time since passage of the 19th  Amendment, women voted differently than men.  And they did so on the basis of women's issues.  Apparently, a significant number of women were  aware of the Republican Right's opposition to  women's rights.   And they acted upon that awareness.  According to all of the exit polls, women voted  for Reagan significantly less than  men did.   The  NEW YORK TIMES/CBS News Poll reported that  8 percent fewer women (46 percent) voted for  Reagan than did men (54 percent).  ABC's poll was similar.   This difference calculated in actual votes amounts to a net loss of  3.3 million female votes for Reagan.  Also significant is the fact that, for the first  time in a decade, fewer women voted than men.  Although women are a majority of the registered  voters, only 49 percent of the total electorate  were women.   The November 4 figures showed  the lowest turnout in a presidential general  election since 1948.  In a dramatic protest against President Carter, the  high rates of inflation and unemployment, and the  Mid-East situation, Carter was swept out of office.  The Republicans and Reagan were successful in  making Carter the issue, blaming him and Democratic policies for the state of the economy and  the crisis in the Mid-East.  (NATIONAL  NOW   TIMES,  DEC/JAN. 1980-81, p. 1.  7461 W. 10th Street  Indianapolis, Indiana 46224  W  Residential  Commercial  Farms  HOMES  When asked if she thought a change in the Presidency would mean the demise of the Women's  Advisory Committee, Robb said she  didn't know,  but she felt sure Phyllis Schafley would have her  job    Encouraging women to give volunteer time to  issues of importance to them, she quoted syndicated columnist, Ellen Goldman on the  New Ambidextrous.     On the one hand they want welfare mothers to get  off their duffs and work; but on the other hand they  want them to stay home and take care of the kids.  On the one hand they want more services; but on the  other hand they want lower taxes. On the one hand  they want more security; but on the other hand they  want more independence.   On the one hand they want  equal pay for equal work; but on the other hand they're  against ERA.   And so they just sit on both hands.    Robb pointed out that women's statistics have always  been important and said that/  today's statistics are  45-52-33.    Forty-five percent of the working women  are mothers with children at home; fifty-two percent  of all women hold paying jobs; and 33 million working women are in low paying jobs known as pink or  blue collar jobs.   By 1990 it is expected that 75 percent of all mothers of teenage children or younger  will be working outside the home.    In response to a question about the President's  Conferences on the Family, Robb said she felt  the Conferences were very successful in spite  of the fact that considerable press coverage  pointed out all of the negative results. Although  participants disagreed on many issues, there  were many areas of mutually shared concerns,  such as domestic violence, economic problems,  child care, marriage penalty tax, and the lack  of parental involvement in schools.  Lynda Bird Johnson Robb urged women to  not  sit on your hands, but reach out and touch each  other's lives   reach out and help to make this a better  country for all of us to live in.    She received a standing ovation.  BOBBIE BOSE  A Feminist Realtor  Office 271-5555  Residence 244-4876  I cannot quite close this account of my  lunch  with Lynda  without relating my personal observations  and feelings.   When she spoke about  Reading Is Fundamental,  a national program to  which she is also committed, she described how  the organization worked and praised the results it  has had.   I felt as though I was listening to a PTA  mother in Bloomington, Indiana. She spoke love-  ingly of her three daughters and of the youngest  said;  She's such a doll    I spent an hour in a room full of people listening to this young woman speak on national, state,  local, and universal issues.   Then I sat in on an  intimate press conference where we really looked  at each other, and spoke to each other.   I shook  her hand and said I had enjoyed her speech and I  thanked her for her work.   That's all.   She was  going back to her world and I to mine, and they  are pretty far apart.   But, for a few brief moments  I felt we were friends.   I think that is one of the  wonderful things about the women's movement--  about being a woman--we have so many things in  common, so many shared experiences.   Lynda Bird  Johnson Robb is the daughter of a former president,  a wealthy woman, and her name is known wherever  she goes.   I am the daughter of a former carpenter,  a member of the middle class, a working woman an  and a  household executive , I am known only to  my circle of friends.   And yet, right then our lives  touched, and it was good.  I BELIEVE IN  WOMANKIND  AND I HELPED PAY FOR  THIS AD   Rebecca Pitts  Martha E. Eubanks  Faith Vahle  Joan B. Bennett  Cordelle K.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Paula Modersohn-Becker   * G ? y  A  BOOK  REVIEW  by JUDITH  WEGENER  When reviewing a book, I open it, leaf through  the pages, look at the illustrations and pull crumbs  of information, at random from the text. Then I  go back, research the topic, search for details and  research the author.  It took me a long time to complete this process  with Paula Modersohn-Becker; Her Life and Work,  written by Gillian Perry, (Harper   Row, 1979).  Being both an artist and a feminist unfortunately  didn't help speed up the process.   I found myself  reading the book saying, this would make a fine  PHd thesis... and indeed that's exactly what it was;  a doctoral thesis for the University of Sussex.  Reading about a famous (yes, I said famous)  woman artist, I found that almost nothing had been  written about Paula Modersohn-Becker and much of  this book comes from the original letters and diaries  of the artist.  The organization of the book is done by artistic  subject (i. e. images of women, children, etc.)  rather than in chronological order, giving a good  insight to Modersohn-Beckers' art, but making it  a bit difficult to follow her life and development  as an artist and person.  Paula Modersohn-Becker lived a short but productive life and during her lifetime was largely  unnoticed as an artististic force.   She is now recognized as an artist of note.   Born in Dresden  on February 8, 1876, she died in 1907 from a  massive heart attack, three weeks after the birth  of her first child.  Modersohn-Becker was a dedicated and serious  artist who took her first formal art lessons at the  age of 12.   Initially her art career was supported by  her parents until a poor review of her first exhibit  (1897) caused them to withdraw their economic  support.  Married shortly thereafter, to Otto Modersohn,  Paula attempted to continue her development as an  artist by changing her base of support from parents  to husband.   All indications were that her's was not  a successful and happy marriage and that Paula  needed freedom to create and travel.   Four times  during the marriage she left the small artist colony  of Worpswede,  Germany and her husband, for Paris,  to study and improve her craft.  Although her husband considered his wife a  genuine  artist, such as there are few in the world,   Paula's  experience as a wife to Otto and mother to a stepdaughter was lonely and unhappy.    Marriage takes  away the illusion that previously bore unpon one's  entire life - that there is a soul mate,   she wrote  in her diary in 1902.  Paula felt a great need to nourish her art, and  found in Paris, the art of Cezanne, Van Gogh,  and Gauguin.   She has been credited with being  the first German artist to use post-Impressionist  styles in her art, a radical break from the lyrical  realism of the Worpswede artist's colony.  Influenced by the overlapping planes of the Cezanne  artistic style, her art became simplier and flatter  and this influence may be seen in many of her  still life compositions (1902-06).  As she wrote in a letter to her husband in 1903,   I have a feeling for the interfacing and the  layering of objects.   I must develop and refine this carefully.     This greater simplicity,  and interest in the color and form of objects,  was to become even more evident in the artist's  work as her style progressed.  'I know I shali not live very long. But why is  that so sad? Is a festival more beautiful because  it lasts longer? My sensuous perceptions grow  sharper, as if I were supposed to take in  everything within the few years that will be  offered to me . ..'  PAUUk BECKER. 1900  The quantity and quality of the reproductions,  both black/white and color gives the reader a  good overview of the artist's style and variety of  work.   In all, Perry's book was a long overdue and  excellent addition to the body of materials written  about notable women artists.  Still Life With Sunflower (1907) uses the color  and brush work of Van Gogh, where the painting  Nude Girl With Flowers (1907) is clearly after the  manner of Gauguin even to the use of the  noble  savage  subject matter.  Modersohn-Becker had difficulty finding models  to pose for her works, as did women artists of that  time period, and relied upon the peasants and  families of Worpswede.   Her interest and concern  for the harsh life of the peasant is seen in such  paintings as Old Woman With Handkerchief (1906)  and Old Bredow (1899).  Modersohn-Becker's diaries and papers weren't  published until a full ten years after her death when  she began to be known within the German art world.  During the Nazi era she was held in disrepute by the  regime and was considered a member of the  degenerate art world.     Today with the growing voice of the  the feminist oriented art world, Paul a-Modersohn-        f  Becker is enjoying her first real recognition as an  artistic force.  esther fuller  consultant to women  in business and the professions  assistance establishing new business or making new businesses more profitable  p.o. box 314 zionsville, in. 46077   50.00  per hour 317-293-1612  Women Who Kill  by    ANN    JONES  A  BOOK REVIEW  by  CAROL  ANN   WILDS  Five years ago a woman-author-scholar-  professor by the name of Ann Jones was teaching a women's literature seminar at City College  in New York.   Many of her students were depressed  by all the literary heroines who had committed  suicide.   One of them posed this question:   Isn't there something a woman can do besides  kill herself?  Jokingly, Jones replied,  A woman  could kill someone else.   Aware that psychological literature indicates that  suicide and homicide are often alternatives to each  other, Jones began researching women who have in  fact killed people and decided to write WOMEN WHO  KILL.  As certain patterns began to emerge, she became  more interested in the subject and stuck with it for  five years.   Because of the extensive research, in  front of the public now lies a provocative and beautifully written book on the subject of  women who  kill.   The book discusses where women have been placed  in society from Colonial times until today; and the  historical value is unsurpassed by any book I have  ever read.   Although throughout the book the main  topic is women who kill or women who have killed,  the message that is communicated is the low position  of women in society.   This low status has caused many  women to escape desperate situations by the only  means they could   by eliminating what they felt  was the immediate source of their oppression, be it  husband, lover, father, or even child.   Women  rarely kill strangers.  The trial descriptions in WOMEN WHO KILL are  excellent and certainly should be carefully examined.  Jones' work is clearly a myth dissolver and is long  overdue.   The book is educational, packed full of  women's history, and it would make a marvelous textbook for a class on women's history, as well as interesting reading for any and all interested parties.  Personally, I anticipate the book will be widely discussed. I'm sure that it will be discussed where I  reside.  One-fourth of the prison population at the Indiana  Women's Prison is incarcerated for killing someone  they loved.   I am a member of this group, serving  15-25 years for killing my husband.   I would be sincerely interested in any comments, positive or negative by those who read WOMEN   WHO  KILL.  Please write to me directly or via WOMANKIND.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  CAN TWO WOMEN  survive a camping  trip without their  husbands? You bet   The Wild, Wild  West is Still There  by  PAT   WATSON  If you haven't washed your hair in a bucket of icy  river water, and I mean icy, you haven't lived.  After four days without showers, Sharon Merriman,  an Indianapolis attorney and I were willing to wash  our hair in anything.  We had been river rafting on the Dolores River,  which is exclusively Colorado mountain snow melt  water. The bucket of river water was so cold, it  made our neck and head muscles contract to the pain  level; but it was worth it. It felt so good when we  quit.  We were surprised to discover that both Sharon's wiry  natural curls and my baby-fine straight hair felt and  looked better than any beauty-shop chemicals had  achieved     ever.   The exhilaration of freshly washed  hair, sparkling summer sunshine, icy water was  truly a  Rocky Mountain high.    Seventeen passengers and eight crew in six rubber  pontoon rafts similar to those used by WWII commandos  made the trip from Cortez to Bedrock in the Southwest  corner of Colorado.   The young crew, six men and two  women, all in their twenties, were referred to as the   kids  by us middle-aged tenderfeet.   They   introduced  us to their wilderness with a contagious joy.  Our first day on the river was a short shakedown cruise  to an early campsite.   We went through a few rapids,,  but nothing that broke water over our bow.   The  scenery in the high Colorado mountains was lush with  spruce, pale aspen in their spring green leaves and  wildflowers - - delphinium, daisies, translucent orange  poppies     all covered by incredibly blue sky.  That first morning in the mountains brought a heavy  frost.    There's ice in the canteen,   Sharon muttered,   no wonder I damn near froze.    A summer sleeping  bag isn't enough when you're above 7, 000 feet --  even in June.   We watched enviously as the 'kids'  popped out of their warm cocoons; they had slept like a  litter of puppies under a community tarp.   Sharon and  I would have gladly traded our air mattresses for a spot in  the middle of that warm group .  Shivering, we dressed in layers for the day:  first, a two-piece bathing suit, then long underwear (my wool blend was much warmer than  Sharon's cotton thermal knit), jeans, hooded  sweatshirt jacket and over that a bulky wool  sweater.   I blessed my expensive Duxback wool  socks, they  were worth every penny they cost.  By the time we had wormed our way into all  this clothing, the kids had breakfast well started  and the call was:  Mud's up   -- campfire coffee,  boiled with fresh river water.   There's nothing  like it.  The*kids'fed us royally.   We had fresh  fruit,  Scrambled Eggs Adrift, sausages, coffee, rolls.  It's unfair to mention Scrambled Eggs Adrift  without sharing the formula: Two eggs well-beaten per  person, minced fresh green onion, diced tomatoes,  sliced mushrooms, and grated mild cheddar cheese  scrambled in an iron skillet.   Another breakfast  featured blueberry pancakes and the final breakfast  of the trip, after six days on the river, was Eggs  Benedict.  Lunches were dependent upon the difficulties  of the river; when we hit a flat campsite anytime  between 12 and 2, we had salad and sandwiches,  fresh fruit, lemonade or beer, and cookies.   An  interesting phenomenon in that dry country is  having your sandwich bread change from fresh and  moist to dry and crusty before you finish your peanut butter and jelly.  At dinner we ate like stevedores, even though  the crew had done all the rowing.   They were  marvelous.   They'd pull those oars for eight heavy  hours, unload at a campsite, and pitch in to cook  dinner for 25 hungry people with never a cross  word or impatient sigh.   And those dinners  The  grilled pork chops were easy, but try chicken  cordon bleu on your next campout, or lasagna  assembled on the spot, or the most marvelous beef  stew.   We even had fresh baked brownies and peach  cobbler.   But the best dessert was strawberry shortcake with whipped cream on Saturday night.  As the only unescorted women on the trip, Sharon  and I became  You-two-girls.     First day, some  of our male fellow passengers offered to help us  wrestle with our duffle bags and tent; we thanked  them, but lugged our own.   Some of the men looked  a trifle glum.      Later one of the men told me:    I  thought sure I'd have to help you with your tent,  your baggage, everything, and there you are, doing  a faster, better job of setting up than I am.    Another accolade came from a dignified older  man who said,  I have to thank  You -two-girls   for giving me the best adventure I've ever had.  I was going to walk around the rapids, and come back  to the boat to get my daybag, but when I saw you  ready to go; I had to go.   I couldn't back out with  You -two-girls sitting there.     He bounced and  bubbled like a little boy:  Shooting Old Snaggletooth  was the most exciting thing I've ever done.    Old Snaggletooth.   Scoring about a five on the  kayak scale of difficulty.   Old Snaggletooth had  loomed ahead like a frightening promise. Anyone  who chose to walk around the rapids rather than ride  them was encouraged to do so. Every piece of gear  was checked to make sure it was secured with rope  and tarp.  Old Snaggletooth was the wildest water I had ever  seen since the tide came in at Tenby, Wales. I  hitched my life jacket tighter and asked:  What  should we do if we get tossed out of the boat?   John, the group leader,   gave me his full attention.   Don't let the boat go over you.   If you fall out, get  as far away from the boat as you can.   Are you sure you  want to go?    Certainly.    It was nice to see his eyes approve.  I'll always remember the light of anticipation on  crewwoman Chris Raffin's face as she checked out  Old Snaggletooth.   One fleeting glance told it all:  she loves the river, loves adventure; she comes fully  alive facing danger.   After seeing her expression,  the Israeli Army couldn't have kept me out of that  boat  Alan Bussey, our boatman, quietly told Sharon and  me where to crouch and where to hold on when going  through the rapids.   The boats were going through  one at a time, so we had to wait our turn -- last.  Over the layers of swimsuit, long Johns,  jeans, sweatshirt jacket and wool sweater, I added my husband's  motorcycling rainsuit and pulled its hood over my  sunhat.  Our turn    My mouth is suddenly dry.   Al pushes  the boat off the bank and we are gripped by the current,  yet it's quiet.   Al rows easily.   I wonder if Old Snaggletooth is a shaggy dog joke.   Suddenly,  we dip.   Water  breaks over the three foot high pontoon prow of the  boat.   I hear the oarlocks creak with strain.    Hang on    Hell yes, I'm hanging on.   We whirl into another rock.  Sharon yells,   Wow   More icy water hits my face  and trickles inside my layers of warm clothing.  Rock. Bounce. Twirl. Strain. Rock.  Spin. Rock.  Creak. Rock. Bounce. Rock. Bounce. Rock. Spin     Peace.   It's all over.   We pull into the bank  and pick up those poor souls who had elected to walk.  We are different.  Al breaks out the beer. For the first time, Sharon  and I, (dedicated winos) appreciate a beer. I start  bailing and one of the crew grabs the bucket to bail,  with more strength and efficiency than I can summon.  We push into the calmer part of the river, and Al  stands to shake his fist,  I've beaten you again, Old  Snaggletooth    We camped early that night. The crew was down to  their last calorie of energy, yet they remained cheerful as they set up for supper.   Sharon and I spread our  wet clothing on shrubbery and toasted our triumph over  the river with a little Chablis.   We watched the rising moon illuminate a rock formation that looked  like a Greek temple on a hill.  The next morning Sharon and I walked about 50  yards to a higher meadow to photograph wild  flowers.   I am suffering from altitude sickness.  I must stop and gasp for air before I can focus  my camera.   It's scary to feel so weak. Striking the tent becomes a major project and we  struggle with zippers, tent poles, sleeping bags  that refuse to roll, and hands that have lost  their strength.   By the next day, we are at a  lower elevation and the weakness has gone.  By our fourth day, we were ready for anything.  One man, a dignified captain of industry who  shall remain nameless here, set off enthroned on  a pile of baggage, wearing a plastic poncho and  holding his can of Coors like a scepter.   That  evening, he was among the first to bathe in the  icy water.   Whoops, yelps, and gasps punctuate  the men's bath as they lather up.  I feel so good  it's sinful,   the 'captain' exults.    Never felt  better in my life.    Back at the next campsite, Sharon and I  elected to take a river bath.   We find a shallow  eddy with a sturdy bush to grab if we lose our  footing in the fast water.   Clutching soap and  branch, I step into the water.   After my feet  turn numb, it is quite refreshing.   The biodegradable Neutrogena soap promptly slips out of my  hands, so I finish sudsing with shampoo and discover that if I immerse just part of me at a time,  I won't go into hypothermia.   Drying in the sunshine while we walked back to our tent in freshly  washed swimsuits and towel sarongs was a marvelous  feeling.   You-two-girls just  amaze me,  says a male  voice.     Did you really take a bath in that river?    Yep. Felt great.     Where did you go?   How did you manage?    Easy. Right over there. Hang on to your soap.    And another convert goes into the river.   We're gonna howl tonight,   Al promised. After  a dinner of chicken cordon bleu, tossed salad, and  strawberry shortcake, John broke out his harmonica  and Al tuned his battered guitar.   Then we had a  campfire songfest that drew this group of strangers  into friends.   A small jug of Tennessee sippin'  whiskey made reverent rounds about the circle.  Al's pleasant voice led us from  When the Saints  Go Marchin' In  to a composed-on-the-spot  ballad about rafting on the Dolores.   The stars  were thick overhead until the moon crept over the  ridge; we threw back our heads and howled and it  was glorious.  I want to go back and ride the river again.  indy rent-a-dent  TALL (317) 923-DENT  Denise McAHi9ter-Lenn, Vice President  2810 Merchants Drive *  Indianapolis, Indiana 46222  Now that I know what primitive camping  is, I can offer some suggestions:  1. Don't skimp on wool clothing; dress in  layers so you can shed or don warmth at  will. Wear wool socks; even when wet,  they will keep your feet warm.  2. Bring SCUBA wetsuit booties.   They won't  hold up to a life on the river, but they'd  have been perfect for a week.   My feet  were cold and wet, with bleeding blisters  where my tennis shoes rubbed.   Pack  moleskin and Band Aids.  3. Get the best tent you can afford. The cost  increases with efficiency, but at high altitude or in a strong wind, an expensive tent  is worth every dollar.  4. Pack a thin mylar emergency blanket; it  literally saved Sharon's   life.  5. Remember you are leaving warm water  behind ; pack a spray can of shampoo, a  jar of cleansing cream, and a box of pre-  moistened towelettes for comfortable  camping.  6. Eventually, you will WANT to take a bath  in the river; carry Ivory or soap on a rope  for this occasion, or splurge on backpacker's  biodegradable soap in a tube.  7. Be prepared to be sleepless, cold, wet, and  to have a glorious experience.

        <pagetext>rjw?  ONI)  W  What's So Good About Cookin'  Anyway?  by   PAT   HEIDENREICH  If just once Mrs. Olsen's coffee would taste like  burnt bark... I would be happy.   My favorite fantasy is that of Mrs. Olsen's cakes falling... because  she took a short-cut in her baking.   Just imagining  that show-off failing in the kitchen sends me into  ectasy  Actually, I guess I have a complex when it  comes to the kitchen.   I realized this last week  when my mother-in-law gave me a soup bone   No  instructions... just a soup bone.   Outside I remained  calm, but inside, I panicked.   It didn't help to notice out of the corner of my eye, that amused little  smirk on my husband's face.   I know he was thinking  . .. after almost 18 years of marriage, she doesn't  know how to make home-made soup.  I decided I'd just show him.   Nonchalantly, I  tossed the bone into the freezer, for use at a later  time and after I've had a chance to research the  subject.  The next morning before the rest of the family was  awake, I blew the dust off the cookbooks and smuggled  them into the bathroom.   I noticed the inscription on  the inside cover of The Betty Crocker one:  Dear  Patty, It's about time you started to use this... Love,  Dad, Christmas 1959.     Mentally I kicked myself  for not taking that good advice.  I finally found soup, Vegetable.   It said,  After  making broth, add diced vegetables simmer 30  minutes.  ... That's the trouble with cookbooks...  they assume so much. Like ...  after making broth   .. .or  top with simple white sauce   (I never saw a  white sauce yet that was simple.)  Oh well, why make this soup thing so difficult, I  thought.   I put the cook-books back on the shelf,  threw the bone in a pot of water and turned the heat  on high.   By the time my husband got up I had celery,  potatoes, green beans and onions all chopped up. He  looked surprised and lifted the cover on the pot.   That  little smirk reappeared as he looked at the globs of  white fat floating on top of the bubbling water.  I gave  him my worst look, so he didn't dare say anything.   He  just shuffled out of the kitchen whistling  Someone's in  the kitchen with Dinah .. .or was it  Be it ever so humble  there's no place like home ... I don't know, it was some  such dumb tune.  Anyway, I didn't let him discourage me.   I  cooked the bone almost all day, periodically  scooping off the fat globules.   Then I took it  out, cut off the meat, gave the bone to the  dog and put the meat and all the vegetables  back into the  broth.     I cooked it all for 30  minutes.   I tasted it.   It was absolutely awful. I  threw in some boullion cubes and some chili powder.   I tasted it.   I threw in some more boullion  cubes.. . It still tasted rotten.   In desperation I  opened two cans of bean sprouts (It was awfully  thin)... and three cans of Beef Stew (it needed  carrots anyway.)  I tasted it again. HMMMMM.  That canned stew certainly did help.  Later we all sat down to the table.   I dished up.  The soup smelled good.   Everyone tried it.   My  husband looked surprised.   This time the smirk was  on my face.    Nothin' to it,     I mumbled.  Everything would've been O.K. but unfortunately  my husband got a sliver of bone in his bowl and  went to dispose of it in the little garbage pail by  the refrigerator.   I knew I should've buried those  Beef Stew Cans...  He didn't say anything.. .but he gave me that  superior-know-it-all look. .  and I noticed that  darn little smirk was back... spoonful of soup  . . . smirk,    s-poonful of soup... smirk.. . spoonful  of soup... smirk. . .

I haven't received the sample  copy.   I'm still interested and if you forgot, please  send me an issue.  The issue might have gone astray.   Not only am  I bedeviled by insensitive editors who do not appreciate my provocative prose and profound wisdom,  but our no-good mail man throws half my mail in  the bushes.   If I could find out whose bushes, I  would retrieve it.  Sincerely,  Catherine Walsh  Editors' Note:  We sent it, and we sent it again and Catherine  Walsh made these comments.. ..  There is mounting evidence that the ERA may be  bogging down, because of its association in the minds  of many with Abortion on Demand, even though they  are entirely separate issues.  I'm sure there are many women who are working in  a man's world--or who have worked there--who see  a crying need for ERA but who are appalled by abortion.  It might be reassuring to us intellectually belligerent  --but spiritually humble souls if ERA had a patron saint.  Ergo:       if we would pass the ERA  We must work and fight and plan and pray  And if our leaders would not faint,  I'd like to suggest a patron saint  Namely, Teresa of Avila,  Outspoken woman, eloquent writer,  As manager number one  A beautiful Spanish lady  A holy mystic,  A Carmelite nun.  And:  In response to  Do clothes make the woman?   which appeared in Issue XV of WOMANKIND and  intimated that we might be losing ground by  a partial return to skirts....  Socrates wore skirts  That's good enough for me  For we all know those gentlemen  Were smart and they were free.  They had a word for everything  And if they opted for flirty skirts  I'd be inclined to trust their choice.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  9.  Continued from page 3  Information  on  Sterilization Available  by J. R. LAWRENCE  What is culdoscopy?  What does colpotomy mean?  How about laparoscopy and laparotomy?  All of these  are  methods of sterilization for females.   A broader  understanding of the differences between these forms of  of permanent birth control could help a woman who is  considering voluntary sterilization.  The Association for Voluntary Sterilization (AVS)  was founded  to make voluntary sterilization readily  available to all adults regardless of parenthood, marital  status, or income.    Their well-written brochures are  understandable and informative, yet concise.   Covered  are the explanations of the various methods of sterilization, their effectiveness factors, safety of the  operations, the legal aspects of the surgery, and the  possible emotional factors that may be involved before  and after the surgery.  Caution is the watchword of the association and  hasty decisions (or decisions to sterilize for the  wrong reasons) are discouraged.   Instead, the AVS  explains what sterilization will or will not do, and  also suggests cases wherein the surgery should not be  considered.   The final choice, of course, belongs to  the individual.   It is the right to know and the right  to choose that is emphasized by the AVS.  The AVS estimates that there are over 12 million  adults who have chosen voluntary sterilization as a  birth control method.   This figure increases by about  one million each year.  For further information on voluntary sterilization,  contact:  The Association for Voluntary Sterilization,  708 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017.

Key elements of NOW'S strategy to win passage  of the ERA and bring the issues of women's rights to  the top of the public agenda include:  A  MASSIVE  MEDIA  CAMPAIGN  STATE  AND  NATIONAL  LOBBYING  to counter reactionary efforts and,  where possible, to make gains for  women's rights.  A   MASSIVE   SERIES OF   SPEAKER TOURS,  backed by an investigative unit, to let  the public know who is paying to keep  women down, and what the right wing is  really up to.  A   VOLUNTEER  NOW  GROUP:   Missionaries for Women's Rights  to  go to Utah and other Mormon areas.  DEFEND  AGAINST RESCISSION  A mobilization of money and legal  talent necessary to meet the challenge  of illegal rescission attempts.  The effort to outlaw abortion has the support of the  Republican Platform, the President-elect and the  Radical Right, and will represent one of the historic  battles of this century - a battle where more than the  right to abortion is at stake - a battle where this  nation will decide whether individuals are free to decide  how many children they will have - a battle to keep the  right to birth control itself.

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  Liberated Children Are Better  by JUDITH  RAE   Gosh, Mom, you wouldn't like Mrs. Taylor,    Robby said.    She's so unliberatedl    Oh, really?  I asked.    Why do you say that?    Like yesterday.   She made Tommy go to the  office.   Just because he socked Jenny,   Robby explained.   Oh?    Yeah.   Mrs. Taylor said, 'Boys shouldn't hit  girls.'    You think it's OK to hit girls?  I asked.   Sure, when they hit you first,   Robby blurted  out.    Like Jenny did to Tommy.     Oh.... Well, how else is Mrs. Taylor unliber-  ated?  I questioned Robby.   Well, she says a lot of dumb things - like  'Young gentlemen shouldn't wear hats inside the  building.' And 'ladies first,' he mimicked his  teacher.    She's even against the ERA    since he wears it often, I imagine Robby is oblivious  to any resulting teasing.  Robby's friend Jimmy recently spent the night.  As the two boys ate French toast for breakfast,  they discussed the upcoming talent show they were  in.   Four boys and four girls were going to dance  disco.   Gee, I wish I could be there on Monday,   I  said.    But I have to teach a class from 8:30  - 10:30.   I won't be able to see you.     That's OK, Mom.   I understand,   Robby  assured me.    Come on, Jimmy; since she won't  be there, let's show her.    Pushing their chairs under the table to make room,  Robby announced,  I'll take the girl's part. Jimmy,  you do the boy's.    Then the two eleven year-olds whirled around the  kitchen.  Enjoying the dancing, I realized how different  Robby is from the boys of my generation.   I could  not picture any eleven year-old boys I had known  dancing happily together.   Certainly none would  have volunteered to be the girl.  Once when Robby quickly needed a short sleeved  shirt, I pulled out the top shirt from my shorts and  t-shirt drawer.   Here, will this do?  I asked without noticing  which shirt it was.  Unfolding it, Robby slipped it over his head and  dashed to the mirror.   Neat-o    This is perfect    'Liberated men are  better,'  he read.    That's me.     Look how well it fits you, Robby,   I laughed.   First you could wear my shoes. Now my shirts.  Soon you'll be taller than I am.... That shirt looks  nice on you; you may have it if you like.     Thanks, Mom,   he said.  So Robby wears the t-shirt proudly.   I've never  been around when anyone commented on it, but  Jeanine C. Rae, M.S.,M.Div.  Feminist Therapist  Announces  The Opening of an Office  For the  Practice of  Individual, Couple,  Family Therapy  Graham Plaza, Suite 614  205 North College Avenue  Bloomington, Indiana 47401  812/332-3238        812/988-6555  Last summer I drove four boys home from  science and math enrichment class.   Boy, I wouldn't want to be President,   Greg said.   Why not?  several voices asked.   It's too hard.   Too many decisions. Nobody in  their right mind would want to be President,   Greg  exclaimed.   My mom would,   Robby challenged.     Wouldn't  you,   Mom? Wouldn't you like to be the first woman  President?   Before I could answer, Robby turned back to his  friends   My mom would make sure the  ERA passed. She'd  do lots of things for women  If you ever want to know  anything about women or the ERA or anything, just  ask my mom.   She knows all of it.    My eight year old son Mike is also a free spirit.  After Mike and I had seen KRAMER vs. KRAMER,  we talked in the car about men crying.   Let's read 'It's All Right to Cry' when we get home,    Mike suggested.   You mean the song in FREE TO BE YOU AND ME?   I asked.   Yeah, that one,   Mike answered.  We both forgot about the book until it was almost  bed time;for Robby, Mike, and I had been playing  the card game Chauvinist, a feminist version of  Old Maid.   Who wants a massage?  I asked after I got  caught holding the chauvinist   Me    both boys yelled.   Great  Let's all three massage and be massaged.  Two of us can work on the other one,   I proposed.  After three alternating massage sessions on the  carpet, Mike asked if I'd read him a story.   Gee, Mike, I don't know,   I yawned.    I'm  so relaxed. It's hard to keep my eyes open.    I'll read to him,   Robby volunteered.   I'll go get FREE TO BE YOU AND ME,   Mike  said.  While Mike scampered off to his bedroom, Robby  and I plopped pillows on the floor.  As I cuddled both my sons, Robby sang  It's All  Right to Cry,   recited some poems, and read several  stories to his brother Mike and me.  After I had tucked them into bed, I thought about  my friend whose twelve year-old niece had declined  her aunt's offer of a message with mumblings of not  wanting anyone to think she was queer.   I'm glad my  sons can enjoy touching each other without those  concerns.  Of course Robby, Mike, and all children are influenced by society - grandparents, teachers, Little  League coaches, peers, television, baby sitters. But  I feel my sons' basic attitudes about women will not  succumb to traditional stereotypes.  Though I hope there are many boys and girls who  are free of established roles, I'm afraid there are  not.   I hope feminists will make sure that at least  their own children are liberated.  *z Helaine Vidtoria Press 2*  4080 Dynasty Lane  Martinsville, IN. 46151  Phone: 317-537-2868  Since 1973 - Specialists in Postcards  on Women in History - Past   Present   t r JOCELYN COHEN     NANCY POORE  To receive a catalog, send 300 in coins or stamps.   1  h '  fcl '  O*  a*i lt;  ,l S  YWQ   l   gt;    c  S  ?*o lt;   o  c     4*60   sV**a   v  v    t*s    (3vn  299  .2150  Robby Rogers, author Judith Rae's son models his  Liberated Men Are Better  T-Shirt.  (Photo by J. LaFourest)  A friend recently suggested that people of superior  intelligence and talent should be having more babies.  Unfortunately, she lamented, this is not happening.  I applied her theory to feminists.   How many of us  are choosing not to have babies?  How many decide  to have abortions?  To use birth control until we fear  we're too old to bear children?  How many of us encourage other women to continue to be childless?   It's a drag,   we tell them.    Enjoy your freedom.  Don't get into the hectic life of being a mother.  Don't do what we did.    In the past, I've said these things to certain friends,  to my sisters-in-law, and to my sister when they've  mentioned wanting to have a baby.   Now I'm reconsidering.   My message has changed to:  Please  have a baby. Take care of yourself during your  pregnancy and then rear a child who's free of  stereotypes  gt;   Bring as many liberated children into  the world as you want and can afford,   We need  all the feminists - women and men - we can possibly  get.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  II.  T h  a   w  W  by ROBERTA  LYNCH  Li  v e  I  n  I have nothing against lawyers.   Some of my  best friends are .   Moreover, I couldn't agree more  with all the contemporary Clarence Darrows who  hasten to remind us that the people in power in  this country have learned how to use the law --  in many cases written the law--to serve their  own ends.   We do need attorneys on our side to  make sure that tEe scales of justice don't get  tilted so drastically that we just slide right off.  Having said this, however, I have to go on to  say that I'm beginning to get worried about the   legalization  (to redefine a term) of our society.  First, there is the growing tendency to look to  the courts not just as social mediators between  citizens, e.g. landlords and tenants, but as personal mediators between friends and relations.  This is best exemplified by the case of divorce.  As more and more spouses fail to wait till death  do part, divorces alone are creating an entire  legal industry.  But that's not all.   Now we also have live-in   girlfriends  suing for alimony and children suing  their parents for not bringing them up properly  and husbands suing their wives for failure to keep  the house clean.    The vengeful streak that all  of us possess is increasingly finding its outlet in  attempts to bring the entire weight of the law  down on those who cross us.  Secondly, there is the intensification of the  long-standing American tradition of seeking redress for pain and injury as a solitary individual  embarked on a long and often tortuous journey  through the land of lawsuits.   These days personal injury suits are becoming the primary  response--sometimes the only response--to  the wrongs that big business visits upon the average citizen   for everything ranging from defective  lawn mowers to radiation contamination.  Take the recent revelations about the hazards  of Rely tampons.   I don't know just what I expected, particularly since Procter   Gamble did  pull them off the market so quickly.   But somehow  it seemed disconcerting to have the major image  beamed into my living room be that of lawyers  describing the million dollar lawsuits that would  be filed by victims of toxic shock syndrome.  I guess I wanted angry women marching, or  major public hearings, or inquiries into other  brands (no one has yet paid much attention to  the persistent rumors of asbestos in Tampax).  It is the tendency to rely on the courts     which frequently offer attention-getting tactical ploys--rather than concentrating on the nitty-  gritty of organizing.  The issue of sexual harassment on the job may be a current case in point.  Considerable public pressure--primarily through  the media--is being directed toward getting the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to  issue guidelines regarding such behavior.   A  recent newspaper article announced their  imminent publication and quoted a local lawyer  as optimistically predicting a  litigation explosion  in their wake.  Women should, of course, have whatever  tools it takes to maintain their jobs and their  self-respect.   But there's something about this  gravitational pull toward the courthouse that  strikes me as problematic    in this and other  instances.   It represents the intersection of  several disturbing elements in our society today.  Perhaps the most widespread of these is the  mystification of knowledge.   Everything is projected as being so complex   or is made so complex--that the  layman  (or woman) can't grasp  it without the help of the expert.  I happen to be among those who believe in the  necessity for specialists: some things are so complex that it would take a lot more time than this  average person wants to expend before they could  be grasped But more and more there is a tendency  to complicate things that could--and should--be  simple.  In my state the worker's compensation system is  supposed to be a straightforward program of no-  fault insurance.   In reality, it has evolved to the  point where nearly 79, 000 cases required attorneys  in 1978 alone.   The technicalities built into similar laws in most states mean that nation-wide,420  of every workers' compensation dollar goes into  legal and administrative costs rather than into aid  for the injured worker.   And workers end up feeling  that that it's all beyond their ken.  Another element is a kind of de-personalization  that leads people to seek legal redress for every  form of personal conflict.   The breakdown of '  communities means that informal mediating  figures   an older relative, a respected clergyperson     have largely vanished as integral parts of social  networks.   Moreover, people are without a sense of  ethics about how to relate to each other and therefore without much sense of what is  fair  behavior  anymore.   The result is that intimate relationships  can move almost overnight from the privacy of the  bedroom to the publicity of the courtroom.  The third   and perhaps most important   element  is a feeling of powerlessness.   Because people so often  see themselves as isolated individuals, they find it  hard to think of or effect collective solutions to the  problems they face.   And they tend to look for the  small trade-off rather than any significant resolution.  In this context,  taking their concerns to a lawyer often  appears as the only recourse.  Thus, a woman whose husband assaults her may  seek a restraining order when economic circumstances  make her feel she can't simply walk out on him. Or  an injured worker will settle for a workers' comp payment because it seems so hard to get the company to  correct the unsafe conditions that caused the accident.  One final factorin all this that can't be ignored is  the increasing reliance on legal strategies among  America's power elite--both in managing its fortunes  and in managing its workforce.  What Robert Reich of the Federal Trade Commission  has termed  paper entrepreneurism  has become the  dominant aspect of corporate policy today.   In essence,  industry no longer concentrates on technological innovation, but on manipulation of assets through joint  MARBAUGH  MARBAUGH*MARBAUGH  MARBAUGH  MARBAUGH  MARBAUGH*MARBAUGH  MARBAUGH  I   lt;  CQ  or   lt;       I  e gt;   lt;  m  or   lt;       O   lt;  m  or   lt;       I  O   lt;  CO  or   lt;       I  O   lt;  CO  or   lt;       I  O  D   lt;  m  or   lt;  Complete Instant   Offset Printing  6324322  FORMS  BROCHURES  LETTERHEADS  SPECS  BOOKLETS  ENVELOPES  AR BAUGH  ENGINEERING  SUPPLY  CO.,  INC.

At the same time, attempts to control the workforce  have reached new levels of sophistication through the  use of legal tactics.   In fact, lawyers have replaced  personnel managers   and Pinkertons--as the primary  agents in undermining the operation or organization of  unions.  I suspect that these kind of trends at the top tend to  make those at the bottom feel that they can't make it  without lawyers at their side.   And sometimes, of  course, they can't.  But I'd like to advocate a little judiciousness in our  approach to the law as political movements.  First because, however inadvertently,  legalism   can serve to reinforce social characteristics that  stifle rather than free people.   It can add to people's  sense that the problem is beyond them, something that  can only be dealt with by experts.   And it can call up  the ever-ready impulse to rush off on one's own to file  suit or whatever rather than reaching out to others to  look for a common solution.  Secondly, courting the courts can frequently lead to  putting organizing on the back burner while waiting for  The Decision to resolve the problem.  Finally, I'm really not convinced that a  litigation  explosion  is the most effective approach to many  issues.   I suspect that a good union local--initiated  and led by concerned women--could do more to end  sexual harassment at a workplace than a dozen court  suits.   And it could do a lot of other things as well     like give women a sense of their own power and  strengthen relationships among them and teach them  new skills that would demystify even the law a little  bit.  Maybe we should make the courts the last resort for  a change.  Roberta Lynch is active in the New American  Movement, a democratic socialist organization  (c) In  These   Times  UNIVERSITY  6360 N.

Q)  The ERA was re-introduced into Congress on July 14, and will probably  pass after the November elections,  when dissatisfaction with Reagan's  policies will translate into more liberal  members being elected to Congress.  The struggle to get the necessary 38  states to ratify it will begin again, and  women may have to revise our tactics.  The opposition will also gather in  force. But whatever the eventual fate of  the ERA, the principle it embodies     equality of rights   will continue to  revolutionize American society.

Thus the ten years of struggle to  ratify the ERA have not been in vain.  During those years, women have  rediscovered their power as individuals  and as a united force, a power which  has lain nearly dormant since the  suffragist movement. Further, and as  important, society has become aware  of, if not yet willing to rectify, the terrible inequities faced by women, and attitudes have changed drastically in  favor of equality in all segments of life:  all surveys showed that the majority of  Americans favor ERA.  We don't  expect every  woman  in America to  send  25 to  NOW.  Just the  100 million  who are  discriminated  against.  NOW    National Organization for Women  P.O.

If peace broke out tomorrow, what one  word would writers have to describe the  event? Many words exist to describe tragic  events, including catastrophe. To solve  this dilemna, a competition was created  to find the antonym to catastrophe.  Over 400 unique and creative words were  submitted. Entries from England and Switzerland added an international flare to the  quest. The contestants themselves, using  a participative Delphi voting technique,  determined the top 10 words. Their second  vote produced the winner: BENE5TR0PHE.  Bene comes from the Latin for good. The  Greek word strephein, to turn, produces  strophe. Most  radical turns for the good   require creation or bringing together.  Merging of Latin and Greek seem very appropriate.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Wonder Woman Award   ...Sports are everywhere that Girls Clubs 9  g  are.   The Wonder Woman Foundation, a public foundation initiated by Warner Communications  Inc. and DC Comics Inc. in 1981, and the Girls  Clubs of America, Inc. (GCA) has announced  a new joint Sports Award Program for 1982-  83. The Wonder Woman Foundation grant to  the Girls Clubs for the Sports Award Program  was announced by Donna de Varona, NBC sports  commentator and Olympic gold medal winner,  at the 37th annual Girls Clubs of America  national conference held in Cambridge, Massachusetts (April 15-18).  Donna de Varona, a founder and current  President of the Women's Sports Foundation  and Board member of The Wonder Woman  Foundation, addressed at the GCA conference  and said:  We are proud to be undertaking this program with the Girls Clubs of America.   We believe the program will encourage  excellent and innovative sports programs for  girls at the local level.   Speaking about the expansion of women's  sports, de Varona noted that  women are setting  and breaking records at an incredible pace;  internationally, women are being recognized  as athletes, and as a result, women's cycling  and a women's marathon have been added to  the 1984 Olympic Games; two women have been  recently elected to the International Olympic  Committee (the first time in its history that  women have had representation on this powerful committee); and in the U.S. women and  girls are participating in sports at unprecedented levels.   Recalling the importance in her own career  of the early sports training which led to  her Olympic medals, de Varona said,  the need  to train, to strengthen our minds and our  bodies, to experience the feeling of accomplishment, to develop skills which encourage more  positive, open attitudes are all fundamentals  of sports participation. These experiences  can benefit and challenge every aspect of  our development.   The Wonder Woman Foundation/GCA Sports  Award program is intended to give national  recognition to outstanding Girls Clubs sports  programs. Awards of  1,000 will be given  to eight Clubs for their accomplishments in  sports programming, and an additional two  awards will be given out for special merit  in innovative sports programs. The awards  may recognize an ongoing program or a onetime special event. Programs may be team  sports such as volleyball, soccer, basketball, or track and field events. Individual  sports will also be eligible, such as swimming  gymnastics, mountain climbing, rafting, and  skiing.   The Wonder Woman character, created by  psychologist William Marston in 1941, has  always been an inspiration to girls and women:  self-reliance and self-respect are two important aspects of her character. Because these  two qualities are the positive aspects of  sports programs in general, we developed the  idea for an awards program involving a youth  services organization,  said Jenette Kahn,  President of The Wonder Woman Foundation.  The Wonder Woman Foundation was established  to honor the 40th anniversary of the creation  of the fictional heroine, Wonder Woman. During  1982, the Foundation will distribute financial  awards to individual women forty years of  age and over, and will honor other women of  achievement in a variety of fields.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Winner,Sally Little,dedicated her victory  to close friend,Glenda Cannon of Dallas,  whom Little said was very ill. Little  said Cannon helped her when she first  came to the U.S. to play golf. Little  plans to become a citizen soon.  (Photo by K. Niles)  Sally Little, the South African golfer,  shot a four-under par 68 at the 72-hole Mayflower Classic in Indianapolis this summer.  Over 43,000 spectators paid to watch this  four-day Ladies Professional Golf Tournament,  (July 15-18).  Little took home  30,000 of the total  purse money of  200,000.  Beth Daniel came in second, 5 strokes  behind the winner; Sandra Haynie was third.  The LPGA which was on the verge of bankruptcy not too many years ago, today, is one  of the most prosperous professional sports  organizations. Tournament purses continue  to rise. However, they still do not compare  with male golf prize money. But, the LPGA  has instituted a retirement plan for its  athletes: a non-contributory pension fund  that is the first of its kind in the world.  Two rain delays on the last day of  play, that totaled 2 hours and  14 minutes, made the Indpls.  Country Club soggy. However,  this two-person spectator team  didn't seem to mind. (Photo  by K.Niles)  Movie Review of An Officer   A Gentleman  Leaving the theater, I tell my husband  that I am uncomfortable with this much  touted film, An Officer And A Gentleman.  The film manages to demean us all.  Later, rethinking the movie, I perceive  the insidiousness of its bad tidings:   You will be able to napalm villages of  women and children,  barks tough father  figure Sergeant Foley (Lou Gossett, Jr.)  at the outset of the Navy flier's training  program for Officer Candidates. The meanness of the picture, and its brutality are  encased in a cocoon of romantic love. A  strange alliance, one might say. Yet not  so.     How else  to pitch militarism than  through the true path of anti-feminism,  which in this picture becomes romantic  love? Hand in hand they go, we might say,  militarism and anti-feminism, although  the blurbs call it  the best love story,   and one critic says ...it has a touch of  the old-fashioned about it...   Zack Mayo (Richard Gere), the hero,  achieves old-fashioned growth by learning  consideration for his fellow trainees.  Among them, he sheds his loner mentality  and his selfishness through the help of  Sergeant Foley. It is through the byways  of Navy camaraderie, absolutely necessary  in war, coupled with the sexual relaxation  which the local women provide, that Zack  matures into a true blue Navy flier heartthrob.  Yet, Lynette (Lisa Blount), not Zack's  'girl' but his best buddy's 'girl', has  the churlishness to say that  the men   are  using  the 'girls  from the paper  LABYRIS  631 East Michigan  Indianapolis, Indiana 46202  (317) 635-3638  Open at 4:00 p.m.  Monday - Friday  Saturday - 7:00 p.m.  A Feminist Women's Space  OFFERING  A warm and relaxing atmosphere  a large variety of beverages     alcoholic and non alcoholic  and the finest in local and nationally known  women musicians and entertainment  Monthly Events Include  POETRY READING  OPEN MIKE  BIRTHDAY PARTY  PICNICS  WOMENS REVUE AND SHOW  LIVE ENTERTAINMENT  Call, Write or Stop by  For a monthly CALENDAR of upcoming events  mills during their rigorous training near  Seattle.  I feel used , she says.  Not  me,  says Paula (Debra Winger), Zack's  'girl'. These young women do not have  the solidarity that the Navy trainees have.  They have only the drab factories from  which escape is possible by bagging a Navy  flier by any means, including planned pregnancy.  However, Sergeant Foley warns the  Navy's aviators-to-be against the wiles  of these  Puget Sound debs.   On a long deserved first leave, Zack  and his buddy, Sid, not heeding the warning,  sally forth in pursuit of the love game.  On this love route, they meet up with  a local resident who detains them, a  peacenik , a young man who calls them  war-  SPECIAL THANKS TO:  The women and men who called, came over,  sent letters and energy, gave encouragement  and money, who cared and who said WOMANKIND  cannot die.

If one still desires to see the film, do  so, by all means. But have your own fun.  You will enjoy the actress Debra Winger  (Paula). She is vibrant, alive     it's her  picture. Why? She has the life force. We  can believe her whether or not her choices  are sensible. She's a winner. The rest of  the film is not. It's hokum.  This film depicts females as generally unsavory, out to get what they can from a man.  Women should go ga ga over the idea of a  Navy aviator, shouldn't they? Women should  have no further ambitions, should they? If  we believe these ideas, we are indeed demeaned. Are we, men and women, come to this,  that we believe all that?

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  An Interview with Margie Adam  fp  by NANCY BROOKS  Bloomington,IN  Elyssia McCormack and I interviewed  Margie Adam for WOMANKIND on one of the  first warm days of spring. We were a  little nervous. Elyssia was almost eleven years old, and a composer. She likes  Margie's albums, and was eager to meet  the woman whose music she'd heard. I was  eager to hear more from the woman whose  music has accompanied me (no pun intended) in many places, physical and emotional. And Margie, as it turned out, was  eager to talk. She had much to say. With  expressive circular gestures and an expansive conversational style, Margie talked.  As we walked into the room, Margie said:   You must be Elyssia. I hear you write  music.   Elyssia: Uh-huh. Just a few songs.  Margie: Do you play the piano?  E: Uh-huh.  M: When did you start playing?  E: Last year.  M: Last year  So just right after you  started playing, you started making up  your own songs? I started playing when  I was around two. But I didn't start  writing music til I was about sixteen.  It took me a long time to start making  up songs. I think that's incredible.  What do you make up songs about? Do  they have words?  E:  My mom and I are writing some words.  Don't underestimate love's own true  beauty.  It really is so much more than it  seems.  It shines 'round your face and grows  as a flower blooms.  It opens our hearts and brings out  the rainbows  All of the colors that live inside  you....  M: That's wonderful. What's your idea of  what you want to do ? I mean, are you going to keep writing? Think you're going  to sing them out in the world or...?  E: I don't know.  M: I didn't know either. I mean, I don't  think you have to know.  E: I'm just gonna wait and see.  M: Yeah, that's what I said. When I started  writing my songs, I didn't write 'em on  purpose, you know? I just let 'em     whenever they came they just came. I did  n't just sit down and say,  Now I'm going  to write a song,  or something like that.  And I think I wrote music for the piano  alone for about ten years. Just whenever  they'd come.  E: When you were in the mood.  M: Yeah, exactly  When I was in the mood  they'd kind of pop out on me. But then I  decided I'd try to. I just thought,  well, how about if I really try to do it  on purpose. How about if I really take  myself seriously as a composer? That's  when the words started coming. I hadn't  written lyrics. I didn't know that was  going to happen. I thought, I'll just  write these songs and I took off a year  on purpose for my work. I didn't go to  school or anything. I just focused on  it, which I'd never done before. That  was about ten years ago. And just by taking myself seriously, that's when the lyrics came. And at the end of that year I  noticed that I wanted to see what other  people thought of it and that's when I  (Continued to Page 11)  There is an amazing moment that comes between  the end of a song and the beginning of the audience's  applause. I can hear a sigh from anywhere in the  room in that second or two of intense stillness.  Through that tiny opening, I feel a powerful stream  of energy flowing between the audience and me.

I could feel the  audience's anticipation. They were waiting  for Nancy Brooks of Womanshine Productions,  Inc. to perform excerpts from WOMAN'S WORD.  I was at the National Women's Music  Festival in early June at Indiana University  in Bloomington, Indiana and this taas my  first opportunity to experience Brooks,  performance.  During the all-too-brief time from  when she walked up the aisle to the stage  until the house lights came on and she  took her bows, I was totally involved in  her magic. Bringing alive her own words  and thoughts and those of other women like  Susan Griffin, Marge Piercy, and Gertrude  Stein, I experienced their(and my own)  lauqhter, pathos, pride and anger.  During  Matrilineaqe,  I admired  the women who were part of Brook's own past  and her present; I regretted how little  I knew of my own foremothers.  During  I Like to Think of Harriet  Tubman  by Susan Griffin I uncomfortably  confronted some of my own anger. And I  enjoyed and was supported by Brooks' finger  snapping  Push On Through.  Minor on-stage  costume changes of shawls and dresses  indicated the changes in characters and  added to the enjoyment. Each time, Brooks  came forward a different woman. It.was  truly magic.  Then Brooks and her enthusiastic  and talented crew received their deserved  applause.  I look forward to seeing another  performance by Nancy Brooks and Womanshine.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  National Women's Music Festival in Bloomington, In  Women from across the nation and Canada  migrated to Indiana University for the 8th  National Women's Music Festival.  Spanning  June 4, 5, and 6, attendees roamed two  large merchants' rooms, joined any of around  80 informational and recreational workshops,  and attended their choice of nine concerts  by leading performers of women's music and  comedy.  The idea for the festival was sparked after  last year's Michigan Women's Music Festival  by a group of women including Mary Byrne,  the owner of Indianapolis' Labyris nightclub, and Robin Tyler, a nationally known  feminist comic. Byrne went on to become the  festival's producer, assisted by Jewel Ech-  elbarger. Due to extreme right-wing opposition and homophobia, the festival was exiled  from its seven-year home at Champaign, Illinois. According to Tyler,  This just goes  to show people that if we get pushed down in  one place, we'll pop up in another. This  festival is an historic event     it's an act  of resistance -  Festival preparation began in January and  included much help from Ann Falkner of the  I.U. conference bureau and Kathy Caras of  the festival administration. Outside help  was received from resources in Indianapolis,  Chicago, Louisville, and Cincinnati.  Mary Byrne estimated the festival's budget  was between 20 and 30,000 dollars. Outside  financial help was given through Robin Tyler  and Ginni Clemmins benefit shows, T-shirt  sales, and the sale of ads in the festival  program. Byrne commented on how pleased she  was with festival response, citing that the  workshop holders received no money for conducting their workshops, and performers received only a small stipend, making the major portion of the festival a cooperative  volunteer effort.  by E.K.B.  FRIDAY CONCERTS  Friday evening's performance began with  the piercing beauty of Kay Gardner's flute.  Using the eerie notes of a tri-tone gong  and a percussion background provided by  the audience's jingling car keys, Gardner's  haunting melody smoothed the surface of   Temple of Ishtar,  to a satin finish.  Another offering, the Hindu  Pan-Kasmika,   fared less well, lacking the spontaneous  blend of sound and mood which only intimate  involvement with the culture can provide.   Moods  made it up to us with the personalities of each instrument displayed with  consumate artistry. Gardner and protegee  Mojo wove a tapestry of emotions into a  masterpiece of musical language. As they  interpreted words suggested by the audience,  the wit and subtle, tongue-in-cheek style  of Gardner and Mojo worked its magic from  Anger to Passion to Eggplant Parmesan.  Gardner's  Wandering Girl  theme led us  into an exotic 'other world' made familiar  by a realization of the universality of  women.  Leaving the Temple,  was the perfect recessional to this emotion packed  performance.  Concerted Effort combined the talents  of Julie Kabat, soprano, and Carole Friedman  pianist. Showcasing the talents of women  composers past and present, and examining  the problems each woman faced and overcame,  Friedman and Kabat presented an innovative  hour of sample sketches of the personalities  and their music.  The National Endowment for the Humanities  funded this segment of the program. Credit  must go to Kabat and Friedman for a quality  performance of unusual music.

ERA/NOW Rally before the NWMF Sunday Concerts that featured ALIVE  Ginni Clemens, and Mary Watkins. The Showalter Fountain at  the IU Campus in the foreground. (Photo by;K. Niles)  I forgot about taking notes, so all I remember is a warm, beautiful woman being my  friend in a world of music. Margie Adam  is what women's music is all about. She  revels in Being, from the barely repressed  anger of  We Shall Go Forth  to the gentle  timelessness of  Tender Lady.  All of  her is onstage, reaching out.  The audience and Margie Adam become one  as they reach out towards each other. There  were several encores. An evening with Mar  gie Adam is unforgettable.  by M.P.  See Margie Adam Interview on Page 6  SATURDAY CONCERTS  Saturday, the main day for crowds and the  first day of sunshine, closed with a set of  three concerts by Teresa Trull and Julie  Homi, Robin Tyler, and Edwina Lee Tyler and  A Piece of the World.  First on the night's agenda were Teresa  Trull and her pianist, Julie Homi. As the  stage lights brightened, Trull stood front  and center, graciously recieving a hearty  round of applause. Bouncing around the  stage in an olive green jumpsuit     complete  with a bright purple belt -- and white high-  top sneakers, she immediately set the mood  with audience participation and lively, exuberant behavior. Following her first song,   Natural Woman , she told a brief story of  the  terror  which infants used to cause  her. Having been reluctant to even be near  infants, her attitude was swiftly reversed  when she attended the births of three  friends' children. Awed at the miracle of  birth and proud of her new attitudes, she   wanted to exploit them in a song,  and so'  sang  Precious One.  Julie Homi, Trull's pianist, performed her  own rendition of Playing In The Yard,  in  which she bounced along the keyboard to a  spritely tempo. London-born and classically  trained in jazz, she regularly travels with  Trull.  Later, Trull comandeered the aid of Brenda  Cartwright, the interpreter for the audience's  hearing impaired. In this, Trull sang the  fast-paced blues number,  Everyone Wants to  Go to Heaven, But Nobody Wants to Die,  increasing the pace each time through.  The point of this was to see who would get  tangled in the words first; Trull, singing  with her mouth, or Cartwright, singing with  her hands. As Trull was reaching the limit  of her speed, Cartwright waved her hands in  a definite  Help   gesture.  After a brief rest for Cartwright, Trull  gained the audience's help for background  singing for  My Love is In Your Hands , then  closed her concert with a tribute to Olivia  Records, her  home  recording company, and  stated that it also applied to the festival  and the persons in attendance.  After all,  she said,  home is where your heart is.  Following Trull, the emcee announced, to  great applause, the name of the next performer     Robin Tyler. There was an unusual wait  for Tyler's appearance, and just as the audience began to mumble, a follow-spot was  trained into the pit in front of the stage.  There, in typical  Joe Cool  fashion, rose  Tyler on a hydraulic stage apron.  Bedecked in tight black slacks and a black  velvet-like jacket over, of course, a lavender shirt, Tyler launched into a monologue  of topics including the Falklands war, the  President, childbirth, gynecology, fashion  trends, religion, and  coming out.   Herself a Jew from Winnipeg, Manitoba, she  reported how Jews know for a fact that Jesus  was indeed Jewish:  ... he lived at home until he  was   thirty,   he   took  up his  Father's  profession, and his mother thought he was  God.   In explanation of the  'old school' of  dykes,  she included that it was proper for  a  butch,  to be paired with a  fernme,  and  lamented the fact that she was attracted to   butch,  in obvious clash with the rules.  I  can't believe it.  She shook her head. I'm  a queer queer... a faggot dyke..'.' Then she  brightned, and said,  Aw, I'm just a born-  again butch    Later, she told of a typical trip to the  gynecologist; she lay upon a footlocker and  raised her legs into the air and continued,   ...then the doctor leaves the room to get  the speculum out of the refrigerator... By  the way, anyone who takes a picture now has  got to be a pervert..'.' Of course, there were  muffled chuckles and a flurry of tripping  shutters. Tyler lowered her microphone and  yelled,  Perverts    Once again;. Brenda Cartwright, the quiet,  shy interpreter, was confronted with direct  involvement with a performer. Tyler walked  to a small table set with a vase of dried up  flowers and a bottle of Perrier, and asked  Cartwright to come over and have a drink.  Cartwright blushed, and slowly went to the  table. Tyler poured a glass of Perrier and,  looking at the glass and the bottle, and offered the bottle to Cartwright, saying,   You're butch, YOU drink out of the bottle    Cartwright's face turned as red as her hair,  and she looked to the audience and shrugged.   Life's lonely on the road, I've got to  flirt with someone   said Tyler, as she took  one of the crispy flowers from the vase and  said,  Here, have a weed.  At this, Cartwright was totally destroyed, and turned  her back to the audience and covered her  face. Tyler beamed.  Edwina Lee Tyler and A Piece of the World,  doing African folk music, appeared last.  (Continued to Page 10)

        <pagetext>Oh How We Danced  by PAT HEIDENREICH  Last week had a lot of potential for  gaiety, frivolity and good times...even a  second honeymoon. Roquespiere, my husband,  had to fly to Chicago on business, so naturally  I planned to tag along. I could dig laying  around a plush hotel for a few days.  From experience I learned not to plan too  far ahead. The last time we planned a second  honeymoon we were loading the suitcases in  the car when our oldest came running after  us with a freshly broken arm. He had been  polevaultinq in the backyard. ..we spent the  weekend at St. Vincent's Hospital.  So this time, I waited until Tuesday, the  day of departure, to get ready. Being the  responsible parent I am, I made reservations  on a different flight than his, so in case  one of us got wiped out, the other would  still be left to clobber the kids when neces  sary.  Everything was cool... then I found out  that my brother and his wife, our babysitters,  had temperatures of 104 and 102 respectively.  I toyed with the idea of getting a stranger in, but the last minute housework to make  the joint presentable, seemed an unsurmountable  gigantic hassle. Gad, I'd even have to clean  the bathroom.  I decided to stay home and plan a big Saturday night for our anniversary.  I figured  we'd have a few cocktails at home while dressing for the occasion. Then dinner at a quiet  candlelit French restaurant, with our own  bottle of champagne in a bucket of ice at  our table. After a long drawn out dinner  with lots of romantic conversation and the  reliving of our favorite memories, we'd spend  the rest of the night until the wee hours  dancing in  each other1s  arms.      It  would be  an anniversary to remember.  When the big night arrived, I knew from  the start it would be a bummer. First of  all, Roquespiere had the cough of the century  and I didn't get a chance to get my hair done.  We couldn't leave until we picked up one  of the kids at school from an out of town  trip with the team. By the time he called  at 8:30, we were sleepy from the cocktails  and had eaten two pizzas to appease our appetites.  And after listening to ... Gosh, (cough,  cough) I sure would like to watch (cough,  cough)  Andromeda Strain  on T.V. tonight  (cough, cough)  for two hours, I decided maybe  a quiet evening at home together would be  just as well. After all, who was I to deprive  him of seeing an unknown virus from outer  space take over the world?  I consoled myself with the fact that   Psycho  was on the Late Show and I knew I  would like that one myself.  I had to kill time until Andromeda was  over so I opened a can of cashews and settled  down comfortably on the couch with the February  issue of Redbook, and started reading  Why  Every Woman Flirts...And What It Really Means.   I remember I was just about to find out...when  I fell asleep. I woke up on the couch at  8 a.m. with the can of nuts perched precariously on my stomach and realized that the anniversary celebration was all over... and,  worse, so was  Psycho,  which I had missed  altogether.  Indiana Writers Conference  The Seventh Annual  Central Indiana Writers' Association  Writers' Conference  1400 East Hanna Avenue in Indianapolis  October 30-31, Indiana Central University  **featuring**  Jackie Johnson, Fiction Editor   Redbook  Tom Keating, Columnist   Indianapolis Star  Janice Lee Smith, Children's Author  Bill Thomas, Freelance Photojournalist  For a brochure, call (317) 888-2219,evenings  WOMANKIND  Some Kind of Triumph   That's right, call the police,  I righteously demanded.  We'll see what they say  about your assault on me    The pharmacist had deliberately chosen  to be mean and unreasonable. I was the customer and it was my right to have the last word.  I had wanted to exchange a previously  purchased can of car wax. I had explained  to him that the wax I had bought had taken  the paint off my car, and had left a dull  surface appearance. The pharmacist accused  me of dishonest motives for wanting to return  used merchandise. I felt justifiable indignation.  Since I judged myself av rational person  and since I had a receipt for car wax, I  chose a course of action and took the desired  brand. The pharmacist objected.   Give me that wax   he shouted. He lunged  and grabbed my blouse at the throat.  You're  not going anywhere,  he growled.   You can't touch me like that,  I cried.   You're in big'trouble now    Five minutes later, I was waiting at the  back of the drugstore when the police arrived.  The three patrolmen fanned out. Each man  advanced up a separate aisle. Their faces  were grim; their guns were drawn. The situation had taken on a frightening seriousness.  A true story by KATE STRUCK Indianapolis, IN.  Before  I could speak, the pharmacist declared  I was causing a disturbance and was refusing  to leave the drugstore.  The patrol-at-center turned and surveyed  the length of my body.  Lady, what's your  problem?  he barked irritably.  Prudence dictated that I recognize a biased  and unsympathetic judge but irrationality  made me unhearing. Truth and justice had  to be adhered to. I insisted the patrolman  vindicate me.  Animosity permeated the air. The patrolmen  and the pharmacist were exchanging knowing  glances. I had become the bad person.  The middle patrolman thrust his face close  to mine.  Get..out...now,  he ordered.  Bravado struggled with fear. I couldn't  move.   Lady, what do you want?  he snidely asked.  'A little... re... re...respect,  I stammered  Snorts of disgust met that plea.  Sensing my confusion, the patrolman threatened,  I've lost my patience with you. Get  out   fast or I won't be responsible for  what happens next.   Shameful fear dominated outrage. I locked  eyes with the patrolman's.   You win; I'm leaving,  I acquiesced,  only to proclaim triumphantly,  but you're  a son-of-a  .   In the caged darkness of the patrol wagon,  my triumph was ludicrous.  My Father's Message     by judith rae, Indianapolis, in.   How's Michael?  my father asked last  week.   Oh, he's fine,  I answered into the  telephone.   Well, Judi, I want you to give him  a message for me. OK?    Sure,  I said.   What is it?    Tell him to ...to...,  his voice quivered.  To take care... of my...my little  girl,  he said.  I gave Michael the message. But the  message was really for me. My father has  told me the same message a million times:  Judi, you need a man to take care of you.  You can't take care of yourself.  I know my dad has good intentions.  He wants me to be happy. He thinks I will  be happy if I get married again. At seventy  four he's probably not going to change  his perception of me. I will always be  his  little girl.   And Daddy is not the only one. As a  child, I heard a similar message from my  mother, my teachers, my friends, and the  television. I still hear it from my insurance agent, the realtor who sold me  my house, the radio and TV commercials,  and countless others.  Sometimes I believe that stereotype.  I feel I cannot live without a man. I  get scared. I picture myself alone, stranded, without a job, without money. I see  myself as a  bag woman  walking the streets  and going through trash cans looking for  edible garbage.  But wait  That's not accurate. For  two and a half years I have lived without  my husband of thirteen years. I have a  respectable job. I've paid my bills.  I even have some money in a savings account.  When the alternator fell off, I got my  car fixed. When a fuse blew, I (who had  never before touched one) changed the fuse.  I filled out my own income tax forms.  I gave a party all by myself. I've shove?  ed snow, raked leaves, mowed the grass.  In other words, I've survived.  Yes, I've survived. And more, for I  often enjoy taking care of myself.  I remember the satisfaction of putting  together some self-assembly furniture -  a table, a chest of drawers, and a two-  door unit. I recall the good feelings  I had from my first garden of tomatoes,  lettuce, green peppers, kale, spinach,  and onions. Other successes bring smiles:  the kitchen curtains I made. The mice  I got rid of from under my kitchen sink.  The light bulbs I changed from ceiling  fixtures.  The Friday nights I've enjoyed  reading a book at home. The trip I took  to the Smokies alone.  While reading THE HITE REPORT by Sherry  Hite recently, I pondered over one of the  questions in the questionnaire asked of  women:  Do you think of 'single' as a  temporary way of life or a basic one?   I've thought a lot about that question.  For two and a half years I've been thinking my situation was temporary. Eventually  a man would come riding along on a white  horse, swoop me up, and take me off to  the castle of my dreams. He would take  care of poor-little-feeble-weak-me.  Could I enjoy such a life now? After  learning to do so many things that my ex-  husband used to do, would I ever contently  sit by watching a man do them? Would  I willingly give up the control, the power  I've grabbed for myself? Would I want  to stop making decisions for myself?  I think not. I like to think I'm open  to a warm, loving relationship with a man.  But I could never endure a man taking  care of me as my father envisions.  I don't have a daughter, but if I did,  I think I'd want the same for her as I  want for my two sons: to become a strong,  responsible, loving, capable, compassionate  human being.  Hey, I'd like that for my father's daughter, too. At thirty-five, it's not too  late. And once there, there's no turning  back.

        <pagetext>UJOMANKIND  A   Tragedy   in   Four   Acts  I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties  that WOMANKIND is having. My involvement  so far has been to make a sign for the  Dreams   Swords bookstore.  I would like  to offer these drawings for the paper.  The title is  A Tragedy in Four Acts.   It originally was an ecological statement,  but I think it applies to the situation  at Womankind/Womanspace.  I hope the paper will continue.  It  is a source of inspiration for me   my  husband.  My first reading of Womankind was in  Bloomington at Jeanine Rae's office. Thanks  Jeanine.  Kathy Ostling/Herdrich  Indianapolis, IN.  AND  For the first time in my life, mostly  because Womankind's position is one of  support for all women, I feel confident enough  to write and express m  feelings about the  division of women into separate interest  groups. Rebecca Pitts' editorial (issue  22) sparked an angry fire which has been  smoldering within me for over a year. The  concepts of equality, freedom, and particularly sisterhood are, unfortunately, not  held by all feminists.  I have yet to come to terms with who I  am and what is expected of me. I am searching  always, and discovering sometimes, that there  is a rainbow of possibilities for me. I  assumed that many women were going through  this growth process.  I was raised to believe that my worth  as a woman depended on how I raised my children. I was educated to believe that my worth  was dependent on how much money I made.  Unable to have children, I wondered,  what  was my worth?  Unable to find a job, make  a career, I wondered,  what am I doing here?   It was with these feelings that I moved  to Fort Wayne, Indiana with my husband two  years ago. I found myself in a suburban  community surrounded by women who were content  (at least on the outside) with their roles  of wives, mothers, and homemakers. I did  not fit in. Finally, I found a job as an  associate faculty member at a small college.  I thought,  Now, I'll meet some women with  whom I'll have something in common,   and  I did     at least I thought so.  I was invited to attend a networking party  sponsored by the Fort Wayne Women's Bureau,  and I was delighted by the sheer number of  women there, most of whom had impressive  careers. I thought,  I'm going to belong     they will help me.  Several of us, including my friends from the college, stopped  afterward for a glass of wine. During the  discussion that ensued, upcoming activities  sponsored by another feminist group were  being hashed-out. I said,  Hey, why haven't  I been invited to that group's meetings?    BECAUSE YOU ARE JUST A MIDDLE-CLASS HOUSEWIFE  NOT RADICAL ENOUGH FOR US,  they said.  Tears filled my eyes, I finished my wine,  excused myself, and went home thinking,  I  have been insulted by the very people with  whom I thought I would be supported. But,  I am a middle-class housewife, sort-of, so  I haven't really been insulted.  Once again,  I found myself back at square one. This   who am I and what am I supposed to do  stuff  was getting to be more than I could handle.  How can I become active in the women's movement if someone doesn't help me to know how?  Sociological research has shown that the  women's movement is basically a middle-class  phenomenon, but there are many middle-class  women who haven't enough confidence to throw  themselves into active service; there is  a lot of emotional resocialization to contend  with, and the successful resolution of this  conflict is a function of sisterhood.  The defeat of the ERA (and maybe Womankind)  can be directly traced to the fact that many  women are either confused or totally disenfranchised by the varied interest groups  within the movement. Sisterhood must be  the first priority. Divide and conquer is  so obvious. Why have we let it happen?  What are we going to do about it? What can  I  do about it?  Sincerely,  Brenda Johnstone  Ft. Wayne, IN.  P.S. Enclosed is  5.00 for my subscription  renewal, plus another  5.00 to use for attorney fees.  I was very impressed with Volume IV,  Issue XXII, from the Guest Editorial by  Rebecca Pitts and all the way through the  magazine.  I am sorry to learn of the trouble you  have been having. I sincerely hope you  are able to continue with your magazine.  Of the poetry in Volume IV, I especially  liked DAUGHTER OF CULTURE.  I am passing along my copy of Volume  IV ,Issue 22, to my niece.  Best wishes.  Sincerely,  Lois C Solvin  Louisville, KY.  CAREER CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENT  You can gain access to the unadvertised job market through the  insider  system .  Sharon Hatton  Feminist Career Management Specialist  MIKE KENNEY AND ASSOCIATES  107 N. Pennsylvania, Suite 404  Indianapolis, IN 46204  (317)634-8611  Until I received Issue XXII of Womankind,  I would never have thought of the paper  as anything less than a literary journal  of the highest calibre.  I was stunned  at the inclusion of Rebecca Pitts' editorial. Numerous statements in the editorial were offensive to me.  Because the editorial is highlighted  in Issue XXII, I must examine it as an  example of editorial policy, your disclaim -  mer to the contrary.  I no longer wish to subscribe to Womankind. You can keep Issue XXII.  Sandy Marksberry  Indianapolis, IN.  P.S. Do you honestly wish that two hundred  years from now Issue XXII will be read  as an example of feminist endeavor?  A friend here gave me your June Issue  22 so I could read the guest editorial on  your troubles in Indianapolis with splits  in the feminist family. I say family because  we are together whether we like it or not.  I've been involved in three feminist family  splits in Louisville, one purely personal  and two a mix of politics and personal.  I grieve about all three: for where other  people are and for my own losses. I have  no answers. My questions aren't much beyond  a why?  But I believe we must listen to each other  and to keep listening, and to say our own  feelings as clearly as we can.  Being a Hoosier I was happy to discover  your paper. Enclosed is my check for a subscription.  Sincerely,  Lawrie Hamilton  Salem, Indiana  I have subscribed to WOMANKIND in an effort to support women's enterprise and women's writing.  After reading issue 22, however, I must  cancel my subscription, effective immediately. I can not support an individual or institution which exhibits such misogynist attitudes.  I take particular exception to  Many believe that the alliance between the women's  movement and the cause of 'gay' liberation  has had an unfortunate effect on the struggle to ratify the ERA . I would ask you to  consider that through the many years of  struggle for equality, it has been, in great  part, lesbians who have worked and sacrificed for equal rights for all women. If  not for lesbian support and energy (sometimes in spite of the 'movement's' reluctance to recognize lesbian presence) the ERA  would not have succeeded to the point that  (Continued to Page 11)

Tyler introduced a number which she composed as a tribute to her dance instructor,  Sevilla Ford, which employed a variety of  African percussion instruments.  Next was the  Gambia , a number from the  rights of passion, played when a girl enters  womanhood. After this, Tyler did a solo  performance on the stage apron, informing  the audience of the make-up of her drum and  demonstrating the methods used in obtaining  the wide range of sounds. Tyler stated that  the drum was used as a reflection of the  drummer's feelings, employing the drum as a  reflection of the heartbeat.  Finally, the group did a Zulu number, the  Gumboot, a march-style dance which drew much  laughter from the audience, as eight dancers  paraded onto the stags clad in various hats  and caps, T-shirts and tank tops, fatigue  pants, and a multitude of various styled  boots, all of which was adorned with spangles and bell-like decorations. Arms raised  in fists above their heads, they made their  final exit.  Next year's festival dates: June 3-5,  1983.

At the 1982 festival there  was a daily gathering of women  over  forty.  Some women who attended these  workshops barely qualified, while others  were clearly in their sixties, with most  somewhere in between. These gatherings provided opportunities for participants to share  their concerns, to network, to tell their stories, and to enjoy each other's company.  The over 40  meetings were unscheduled  by the planners of the festival. It was  pointed out that in the pre-festival  publicity there was no mention of older  women. This recognition then led group  members to express some concerns about  the lack of interest and consideration  for the particular needs of aging women  on the part of younger persons in the  women's movement. It was suggested that  this may be an indication of younger  Now Hear Thisll  WOMANKIND'S primary source of funds  to publish and to distribute the magapaper  is from subscriptions.

Relating to the Michigan festival  itself, it was pointed out that there  was no provision for the shuttling of  older women for the mile or so that all  participants had to walk and carry their  camping gear. If a woman wanted to  identify herself as  differently  abled,  she could avail herself of  shuttle service to set up camp in the  area designated for the disabled. Most  older women found this identity not  acceptable for themselves.  Out of such expression of concerns  and problems came creative suggestions:  That mention of older women be included  in the Michigan Women's Music Festival's  pre-publicity; that the  over forties   meetings be scheduled as an integral part  of the festival; that shuttle service for  older women be provided if needed; that  a special interest tent be designated  as a gathering place to discuss issues  related to growing older; and that a  camping area be set aside closer to the  center of activities for women whose  walking ability or energy is waning.  But something happened which might  be an indicator of one reason that the  concerns of older women are not considered or taken seriously. Did this vocal  group compile a list of demands to take  to the festival planners? No. Did they  picket? No. Did they make themselves  known in any significant way? No.  The group sent to the collective  one request: that older women be mentioned in the pre-festival publicity.  Has the older woman's conditioning  to  be nice  and  don't rock the boat   kept their concerns and demands from being  known by others? Perhaps so.  The Michigan Women's Music Festival  is for all women, and growing numbers  of women are becoming forty and over.  This is a fact that will have to be recognized by the planners of festivals  and conferences. However, it is also the  responsibility of older women to make  their needs known as well as to participate directly in the planning for the  meeting of those needs.  504 Sudberry Ct.

I didn't think in my head: I'm  going to be a performer now, or I'm going  to be a commercial songwriter and that's  why I've taken this year off. I took it  off....   E: Because you wanted to do it.  M: Yeah, I wanted to do it. It was bothering me that I wasn't writing music, that  I wasn't dealing with that part of myself.  E: Because it made you happy.  M: Yeah. I kept ignoring it and it just was  more and more irritating the more I tried  to ignore it.  Nan: It doesn't leave you alone, does it?  M: No   It just wouldn't leave me alone. So  I finally said, OK, Ok, OK, I'll take a  year off and that's it. No more than  that. And at the end of that I'll go  back to my real work. Whatever that was.  At the end of a year I was so involved  with the process of writing that I wanted  to see what other people thought of it.  So I went to Los Angeles. I had a tape  recording of three songs that I thought  were my best and I took it around to all  the publishing houses.  And lucky for me,  none of them could agree on why it was  that they didn't think my music was what  they wanted to record. Some of them said  it's too complex and some said it was too  simple; some said it was too trite, and  some said it was too philosophical...They  couldn't agree at all. They just knew  that it didn't sound like the music that  was being played on the radio.  E: Or that they bought.  M: Exactly. That they bought. Mostly what  they were buying in the early 70's was  music that was like something else   it  wasn't original music. It sounded like  the latest hit. And my music didn't  sound like anything. It sounded like  mine.  I feel real lucky that that's how  it happened for me. No one said,  Your  music is terrible.  They just said they  didn't know what to do with it. I'm real  lucky That I didn't take their confusion  as reflection on my music. I just said:   Well, that's not where I belong.   And then I heard Kate Millett say that  she was going to have a women's music festival at Sacramento State in California.  So I thought I'd take my music there. I  wasn't a performer. I was a songwriter.  So I said,  I'll take my music there and  maybe someone there will want to sing my  songs.

I also strongly object to the use of the  term  splinter group  which intimates that  WOMANKIND is the only valid feminist group  in the area and that the group you refer to  is subversive. That group has a name, which  in all decency, you should acknowledge. Further, many women involved in Womanspace were  not only 'on the horizon', but actively involved in the feminist movement in 1977 and  long before. Further, many of the women currently involved in Womanspace were involved  in the 'Center' since its conception.* ,  There are many straight sisters involved  in Womanspace, and the argument that  an attitude of overt hostility and contempt for  straight women...has increased  is inaccurate. Womanspace includes and welcomes  all women, regardless of sexual preference,  and I, personally, find it intriguing that  sexual preference has been made an issue  (but then, it has always been a handy  weapon). I would suggest that you ask the  straight women supporters of Womanspace how  they perceive the reception.  Although lesbian-baiting has been a major  focus in this conflict, straight women have  been slandered and offended as well. It is  obvious to most that lesbianism is not the  issue, but only a weapon, and on that basis,  I challenge your claim to fame as a feminist  gt;  Most Sincerely,  Sue A. Bredemus  Indianapolis, IN.  * Editor's note:  Please note that WOMANKIND Center was in  the making before 1980 and that I was looking for a building to house the publication,  lending library, archives, book store, etc.  in December, 1980, and deciding on the 3711  North Sherman Drive building before there  was anyone else involved except my family  by March 1981. The first women's group met  there in May 1981 - at my request. I know  no one from any group that was there at the  WOMANKIND Center's birth except Mary Osborn  and all the women who were in my thoughts  and who have supported the paper and its con -  cept since 1977. Womanspace came into being  in January, 1981 with their first newsletter  and a separate banking account for them. R.  Pitts was referring to this January coup in  her article and in reference to, of course,  the WOMANKIND Center.  I have enjoyed   been stimulated by  Womankind through the months.  Your guest editorial(Issue XXII) by  Rebecca Pitts was helpful to me to understand what was going on   to clarify issues.

        <pagetext>12  WOMANKIND  Letters From Our Readers  Please send us some sample copies of WOMANKIND.  Thank you very much.  Werner Gross  Frankfort  WESTERN-GERMANY  WOMANKIND js very interesting, and I  think it will make a terrific gift for  friends.  I have enclosed a check to cover  my renewal and subscriptions for two friends  Thanks,  Donna Nelson  West Lafayette, IN.  I was very impressed with the results  of the efforts of your limited staff and  resources (Issue 22). It is encouraging to  know that a small number of women, in one  of our most conservative states, have the  courage and the will to persevere in the  name of Sisterhood. Good luck.  Sincerely,  Diane Muzio  Senior, Fordham University  Woodhaven, NY  I've xeroxed you an article from the May  Writer's Digest concerning women's poetry.  I think you will enjoy the article, even  the irony that Jerome uses as his examples,  two poems written by men. What  He's  never heard of Adrienne Rich or Susan Griffith? Sigh   Well, I suppose some of us  are slow, (groan)  I read numerous changes in your organization   realize change is growth,   oftentimes we need others help when we grow.  I've enclosed  5 to extend my subscription to  WOMANKIND   wm continue to help as I am  able to. I believe in what you are doing. I  believe it is good.  Good luck with the Womankind Center    please keep in touch.  Lynnann Sayre  Indianapolis, IN.  I received my second copy (issue 22) of  WOMANKIND and it's better than morning coffee.  I believe in WOMANKIND.  Good Luck,  Lois Barg  St.   Louis,  MO.  Subscribe  PLEASE    NOTE    NEW    ADDRESS     P.O. Box 16305  Indianapolis.

Having succumbed to more promises in  four-color direct mail advertising pieces  from magazines than I care to admit to, it  is seldom that I get pleasure as well as  information from a new publication. However, my first issue of WOMANKIND was read  with several  Wow's  of delight, especially  for the page of VERSE, a medium about which  I do not ordinarily get much excited.  Accolades to all columns and writers.  I am sending a contribution, and a list  of 11 friends who should be as interested  as I in seeing future issues.  Peace and Light,  Kitty Baker  Freelance writer  Hatboro, PA.  In the issue of WOMANKIND (22) I've  just received, I was surprised and delighted  to find that you'd published my poem,   Phoenix.  Thanks very much for the acceptance and the encouragement it brings  me. I've been sending out creative and  critical work for several years and have  met with some success; but never has an  editor been more helpful nor an acceptance  more pleasing.  My women's studies literature course  is going well, and I've been sharing WOMAN  KIND with my students. Some of them are  likely to become readers and perhaps contributors.  Best wishes to you and the rest of the  WOMANKIND staff for a good and productive  summer   Sincerely,  Lauren Lepow  Bridgeton, MD.  Thank you very much for the complimentary  issue of WOMANKIND(22). I enjoyed reading  the publication from cover to cover. As a  matter of fact, it is pleasing enough to  start a subscription....  I will be patiently awaiting my first  copy   Again, thank you   Sister Strength -  Deborah Petersen  Ft. Wayne, IN.  I thoroughly enjoyed your publication  and wish you continued success for the future*  I am interested in contacting one of  the organizers of the October, 1981 dinner  in Ithaca, New York, and wonder if you would  be able to assist me by providing me with  a name and address. Your article on the  event was most enjoyable.  Sincerely,  Nancy Bareis  Brooklyn, NY.  Coming Up in Issue 24  The National Organization for Women  1982 Conference in Indianapolis  The Carnegie Hall Concert  (See Page 3)  Record Reviews,  etc.  I am enclosing  6.00 for a year's subscription, and this includes an extra dollar  for use as you see fit. For your records, I  was led your way by MATRIX, Olympia, WA,  which reprinted WOMANKIND'S Carol Ann  Wilds' story from your Issue 18.  Your sample issue was a delight  I had intended to forego a subscription at this  time, but that issue turned me right around.  Two items in particular interested me  greatly. Firstly, I am attempting to focus  the interest of ACLO's National Prison Project and the American Friends Service Committee on Wilds' plight so I was particularly interested in the letter from the Belgian  woman regarding Amnesty International. Owing  to the survival mechanism of strictly  avoiding dealing with cases in the country  where they occur, A.I. here is unavailable  to us directly. Consequently, we must count  on the assistance of our friends elsewhere.  Logan, by the way, is on the more-or-less  direct routes between Denver and Boise, Las  Vegas, and Jackson. Any of the WOMANKIND  staffers who find themselves passing this way  should stop by for shelter and a chat   Aloha,  Jo Lillis  Logan, UT.  I got the story of Carol Ann Wilds (issue  18 WOMANKIND) published in a feminist magazine called Queen of Spades, and I got very  positive and emotional reactions from it. I  sent her a copy of the article, in Dutch of  course. On March 21, 1982 we had a large  happening of poetry from oppressed authors-  and I read Carol's article there, too.  If you should visit Carol, give her a big  hug from me.  Hope '82 is a good year.  Love,  Freda Groffy  St. Niklass, BELGIUM  My check for  5.00 is enclosed. I had  allowed my subscription to expire.  While I do not subscribe to your hardline feminist stance I defend to the death  your right to hold it.  Besides, I think that WOMANKIND is a  splendid magazine.  Besides, I think your poetry page is  excellent.  Besides, I am enclosing some light verse  of my own in the hope that you include it  in future issues. (You included some in  former issues.)  Sincerely,  Catherine Walsh  Ft. Wayne, IN.

Anthony dollar  If you can tell a  5 dollar bill from a  1 dollar bill,  you can tell a Susan B. dollar from a quarter so don't  forget to continue to ask for them--sometimes demanu  them--from banks and post offices and wherever. Ask  for them and use them Keep them circulating Other  states, businesses, women's groups, government organizations, etc. realize the advantages of the Susan  B. dollars. For intance:  Irvington, N.J., is planning to purchase 1, 200 new  parking meters equipped with slots for the Anthony  dollar.   The meters operate for 12 hours for one dollar.  Bally Manufacturing Corporation, one of the nation's  largest manufacturers of pinball machines, is introducing a new line of pinball machines that will take the  Anthony dollar--five games for one dollar.  The U. S. Postal Service, in cooperation with the  Treasury Department, has distributed promotional  materials on the coin to post offices and branches.  The items include information kit, posters, counter  cards,  and brochures.

Subscription Rate:  4.00  Copyright  1980 by J. LaFourest and M. Osborn. All  rights reserved. Nothing may blueprinted without permission    Bills to create a Women's Rights National Park in  Seneca Falls were introduced simultaneously in the  Senate and House of Representatives on February 5,  1980.   The proposed legislation would create a  national park consisting of the following historic  sites:  Elizabeth Cady Stanton House:     Stanton's home will  be used to portray her feminist activities and her role  as a leader in the Women's Rights Movement. Re      sponsible for calling the first convention in Seneca  Falls,  Stanton wrote the resolution demanding wo -  men's suffrage in the Declaration of Sentiments.  Wesleyan Chapel:   Location of the 1848 meeting,  this site will serve as a Visitors Center providing  information on the historical district.  Bloomer House:  The home of Amelia Bloomer in  Seneca Falls could be used to describe the impact  of her newspaper, the Lily, the first feminist  newspaper in the United States.   Amelia Bloomer  and her paper were also significant for their advocacy of dress reform --  bloomers.    McClintock House:    Mary Anne McClintock was one  of the five women who organized the 1848 meeting,  and she was a member of Waterloo's Hicksite Quaker  Meeting.   The Declaration of Sentiments was composed at her home in Waterloo. Abolitionist and  Quaker influences on the Women's Rights Movement would be presented here.  WITA  gives awards  The Women's International Theatre Alliance  (WITA) will offer two major playwriting awards  in 1981 for women playwrights of all countries.  These are:  The Aphra Behn Award, given in honor of the  first woman to earn her living as a writer, for one  original unproduced and unpublished full-length  play by a contemporary woman playwright.  The Margaret Mayorga Award,  given   in honor  of the woman who brought the one-act play form  to international recognition and acceptance,  for  two original unproduced and   unpublished short  plays by a contemporary woman playwright.  The recipients of these awards will receive public  readings of their winning plays during the Women's  International Theatre Festival, at Skidmore College,  Saratoga Springs, N.Y., June 1981, written introductions to play publishers, and honoraria consisting of festival attendance.  The deadline for submission of scripts for both  awards is January 15, 1981.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Over 40 years ago, it was noted that  among the  really poor people . .. the death rate among bottle  fed babies is twice as high as that of breast fed  babies.     In the 60's mass consumer advertising  discouraged breast feeding and promoted bottle  feeding.   In 1970, the Pan American Health Organization strongly discouraged advertising on govern  ment premises, especially hospitals, and the  acceptance of    free' milk samples.   In November,  1977 the first formal INFACT Conference was held.  Those involved: church groups, developmental  educators, women's groups, etc.   This group had  grown from an earlier Minnesota coalition formed  in July of the same year.  A year later, in September, 1978, more than 250  health professionals at the 11th International Congress of Nutrition signed a petition asking  Nestle  to change its marketing strategies in the developing world . . . and recommended that they  discontinue all promotion of milk formulas and the  use of feeding bottles .  Nestle   boycott  to   continue  The Nestle boycott will continue in an effort to  halt the exploitation of disadvantaged women and  their newborns in Third World countries.   According to INFACT (Infant Formula Action Coalition),  the marketing of baby formulas in developing  countries kills or severely malnourishes infants  whose mothers: cannot afford to purchase adequate  amounts of formula to insure proper infant growth  and development; do not have the means, equip.-  ment or literacy to learn proper sterilization techniques; could breastfeed but are discouraged to do  so by  milk nurses  who are employed by the  Nestle company.  The typical  bottle death  begins when new  mothers leave the hospitals with free samples of  Nestle products.   When the samples are gone,  mothers often find that their breast milk has  dried up.   When the cost of purchasing formula  is found to be prohibitive, mothers often resort  to overdilution in order to  stretch  the formula.  The resulting  nutritional impotency  causes death  by starvation of thousands of infants annually.   In  addition, mothers often do not have access to clean  water or the money to purchase fuel to sterilize a-  vailable water supplies.  Illiteracy also hampers the ability to successfully  bottle feed.   One woman was reported to have fed  her newborn on water alone, thinking the manufactured bottle itself provided the needed nutriments.  In October of 1979, UNICEF, in conjunction with  WHO (World   Health Organization) recommended  guidelines for the Nestle Company which included the  curtailment of advertising, the use of  milk nurses ,  and the distribution of free samples.   Though Nestle  claims to be complying with the WHO/UN ICEF  guidelines, INFACT has isolated specific examples of  Nestle promotional tactics   during the last three  months of 1979 in several Third World countries.   Thus far Nestle has avoided all opportunities to  clarify their own ambiguous position,   Douglas  Johnson, National Chairperson of INFACT, told  WOMANKIND.   He also added that the International  Nestle Boycott Committee has recently been established in order to deal directly with the company.  The committee consists of worldwide labor, religious,,  and women's organizations.  Paul Kramer, of INFACT's Research and Communications Division, also echoed Nestle's failure to comply with the WHO/UNICEF recommendations:   Nestle's  mothercraft nurses continue to operate in South African  health clinics in poverty areas and communities, in  violation of the WHO/UNICEF recommendations and  Nestle's own claims to have fired all such nurses. . . .  Another report from Aboriginal Health Section of  by J. R. LAWRENCE  New South Wales, Australia, several weeks ago  stated that Nestle continues free sampling and  advertising in baby booklets. .. these infractions were  uncovered with a minimum of effort.   We've seen no  evidence that Nestle is taking the recommendations  seriously.    INFACT is urging boycotters to: avoid purchasing any  products manufactured by Nestle or any products manufactured by Nestle-owned companies; clip and mail  Nestle coupons to the company (in order to remove  them from circulation); write letters supporting the  boycott to Nestle offices both in the United States  and in Switzerland.  The success and impact of the continuing boycott  is evident.   For instance, the Norwegian manufacturer  of Jarlsburg cheese ended its contract with Nestle (its  U. S. Distributor) because of the drop in sales.   In Fall  River, Massachusetts, Nestle products were banned from  use in public schools.  David Guerrant, president of the Nestle company  failed to respond to WOMANKIND'S query.   Henry  G. Ciocca, manager of Nestle's office of Corporate  Responsibility, however, sent WOMANKIND several  reprints of articles and testimonial letters which  support Nestle's position.   The materials state that  the boycott attracts support by marketing half-truths  which are rejected by residents and doctors in developing countries.   One missionary, stationed in  Zaire, stated that hundreds of toddlers would die  daily were it not for manufactured powdered milk.  The statement did not, however, mention newborn  babies.  Sales of Nestle products gross billions annually  for the company.   Such an income enables Nestle  to purchase additional corporations,  as the company  did in November,  19T9,  with the Beech-Nut company  which manufactures chewing gum and baby foods.  By continuing the boycott,  INFACT hopes Nestle  will halt or at least curb what it considers to be dubious  --and dangerous--profit-making strategies.  RECENT DEVELOPMENT  The World Health Assembly unanimously   adopted  a resolution on infant and child feeding, including a  mandate to draft a marketing and advertising code for  infant formula and breastmilk substitutes at the May  1980 meeting in Geneva.   The resolution follows  action initiated at the 27th World Health Assembly,  and the joint WHO/UNICEF meeting on the subject  of infant and young child feeding in Geneva in  October, 1979.   It is also the result of persistent international efforts by non-governmental organizations  (NGO) who launched and are still maintaining a campaign against the practices of transnational baby food  companies like Nestle, involving boycotts and other  measures.  BEFORE AND AFTER PHOTOS  These photos were sent to INFACT from Sylvia B  and Herman M. Salk, veterarians, who have returned  from Cameroon, West Africa,  John Fuh was photographed at the Catholic Mission  Hospital in Bafut,   N. W. Province,  Cameroon, where  he was suffering from marasmus     a wasting away  of the body, associated with receiving inadequate  food. (Photo 1)  In John's case he was being fed a  watered-down powdered milk diet.  After 5 months of hospitalization, tender loving  care, nourishing food such as powdered whole milk  and fresh goat's milk, he appears to be normal.  (Photo 2)   We don't know that he was on a Nestle formula,  but it doesn't matter.   The biggest source of powdered milk in Cameroon is the Nestle company.   There  is no fresh milk in the country to speak of, so in a  way Nestle fulfils a need. However, (there are)  dangers involved with poor, uninformed mothers  who are encouraged to formula-feed.  (from a  letter from the Salk's)  John Fuh, June 1978 Catholic Mission Hospital,  Bafut, Cameroon, W. Africa   (Photo 1)  According to UNICEF's 1980  Year of the Child  report  As many as 15 percent of children born in developing  countries will not live to see their first birthday; 200  million children are inadequately nourished; half of the  15 million children under ase 5 are victims in some way  of malnutrition.

        <pagetext>4.   No matter how much women prefer to lean, to  be protected and supported,  nor how much men  desire to have them do so, they (women) must  make the voyage of life alone, and for safety in  an emergency they must know something of the  laws of navigation. ...   ELIZABETH   CADY   STANTON  From an 1892 speech given to the House  Judiciary Committee  You've Got A Long Way To Go, Baby -  Thoughts About Women  59 Years After The Suffrage Amendment  by MARY  L.   BRANSON  Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton met  in the early 1850's and, at once, became fast friends  and co-workers.   Their collaboration is described by  the phrase:    Mrs. Stanton makes  the bullets and  Miss Anthony fires them.    Actually, Susan herself voiced the idea in a letter  to Mrs. Stanton in June, 1856:  Dear friend:... not  a word written on that address... and mercy knows  when I can get a moment, and what is worse, as the  Lord knows full well, if I get all the time in the  world I can't get up a decent document. So for the  love of me and the savings of the reputation of  womankind, I beg you with one baby on your knee  and another at your foot, and four boys whistling,  buzzing, hallooing  Ma, Ma,   set yourself about  the work... it is of small moment who writes the  address, but of vast moment that it be well done....   (Mrs. Stanton used to write most of her speeches after  midnight when the children were asleep.) To make  her point, Susan added:  Now will you load my gun,  leaving me only to pull the trigger and let fly the  powder and ball.   Like Anthony, Lucy Stone, the woman who is most  famous for keeping her maiden name, was another  effective speaker.   A Unitarian, she had earned her  way through Oberlin College, the only school admitting women in the 1840' s.   She had intended .  never to marry; but when she met Henry Blackwell,  brother of Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to  become a U. S. physician, and himself a dedicated  feminist   she married at age 37.    They wrote their  own wedding vows,  and since Lucy never used his  name,  many people did not consider them really  married.  During the Civil War, there was little activity in  the women's movement.   Most of the women were  devoted to the abolitionist cause, and they gave themselves freely to war work.   The end of the war terminated  the 50-year alliance between the women's cause and the  Negro movement.   The split took place when Negro men  got the vote.   Leaders argued that this was the  Negro's  hour  and that it was a matter of practical politics to  push through the vote for Negro men while it had a  chance of ratification.   Adding women's suffrage to the  amendment would inevitably lead to its defeat.  Immediately after the passage of the 15th Amendment, giving Negro men the right to vote, Susan B.  Anthony decided to test the new law which was worded in such a way that it might be construed to include women.   In Rochester, New York, she and 12  other women armed with a copy of the Constitution  demanded the right to register and vote.   The election  inspectors were so startled that they allowed them to  cast their ballots.   The women were promptly arrested  for voting illegally.   Susan was fined  100, which she  refused to pay, hoping she would be imprisoned and  the case could be carried to the Supreme Court.   But  the judge was a shrewd politician and did not order  her arrest.   The fine was never paid.  Many of the women were embittered by the 15th  Amendment  sell-out1.' Elizabeth Cady Stanton, in an  argument with Wendell Phillips, said:  May I ask you  just one question based on the apparent opposition in  which you place the Negro and women? Do you believe the African race is composed entirely of males?   Many Negro women, like Harriet Tubman, the  extraordinary leader of the Underground Railway, and  Sojourner Truth, an early feminist, also played .  active roles in the women's rights movement. Outstanding Black women leaders today, such as Shirley  Chisholm and Barbara Jordon, have remarked that  their sex is a much greater handicap than their race.  Susan B. Anthony continued to campaign until 1906  when, at the age of 86 she gave her  failure is  impossible  farewell address to the women's rights  convention.  For fifty years women had fought for me abolition of  slavery.   Naturally they felt they had won the right to be  included in the suffrage amendment.   Both the Negro  and women's movement were greatly weakened by the  split in their ranks, and it was another fifty years before  women got the vote.  WOMANKIND  CONTINUED FROM ISSUE 14   The women suffragists believed that all other freedoms would follow the right to vote.   A look at the  six decades since 1920 is some sort of an assessment  of women's progress.  During the 1920's, women's clothing underwent the  biggest revolution in history.   Gone were the tight  corsets, long skirts, voluminous undergarments. Although we laugh looking at the 20's fashions today, at  least they enabled women to move easily, and they  did not exaggerate the differences between male and  female shapes.   Also, somehow, even without the  Pill, middleclass women of the 20's had no more  children than they wanted.   Almost all my contemporaries were 'born in the 20's and had only one  sibling.   Also, in the 20's, Wyoming, the first state  to give women the vote elected Nellie T. Ross as      governor.   She was the first woman governor in the  United States.  The 30's brought the Depression and a set-back for  women as well as men.   Many employers believed that  there could be only one paycheck per family, and that  to the man.   Married women schoolteachers were not  hired.   Thanks to the liberal Roosevelt administration,  Frances Perkins, the first woman cabinet minister, was  chosen Secretary of Labor, in 1933.   Also that year the  first woman was elected to the Senate--but only to fulfill the unexpired term of her deceased husband.  Joseph Alsop's biography of Eleanor Roosevelt notes  that many of the reforms of the Roosevelt administration  were her ideas.   She exerted a tremendous influence  upon her husband.  During World War II, women were needed to  man   the defense industry.   Women entered every branch of  the service, ferried planes to England, and filled innumerable jobs in industry.   Every woman who wanted  to work--from 16 to 60 -- found employment and the  excitement of having earnings to spend, along with  the good feeling of independence that brings.  At the end of the war, however, there was a tremendous surge to return women to  their rightful place   in the home; and as marriage and birthrates soared a-  bove all expectations, it seemed that the independent  woman was disappearing.   Movies of the 40's and 50's  featured stars like Rosalind Russell, the hard-boiled  businesswoman who gladly gives up her Adrian suit  with the padded shoulders for a frilly apron a  The Eisenhower decade of togetherness and kids  found me from 1949-58 at home rearing four children.   Toward the end of the diapers, runny noses,  and peanut butter sandwiches decade, I began to  feel I was going batty and began teaching art again,  part-time.   My youngest daughter, who was only six  months old at the time, turned out to be the most  healthy, outgoing person any mother could hope for   The 50's decade yielded no firsts for women on the  political scene.  We think of the 60's as the decade of the youth  revolt.   Those same kids that we stayed home with,  that we dosed with Dr. Spock, permissiveness, and  instant gratification broke out to   do their own  thing .   But the women's movement broke out again,  too.   With Betty Friedan's book, The Feminine Mys-  tique in 1963, one woman after another began to  question all the pre-structured roles of women in  society.   It was like the beginning of the movement,  over 100 years earlier, when every issue as it pertained to women was ctiallenged and examined.   The  Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was intended to end  employment discrimination against blacks, was  amended to include sex discrimination, too, largely  because of Michigan Congresswoman Martha Griffith's  presence in the House of Representatives.   This single  act did much for women's fair employment. However,  it has certainly not done everything it should have  done.  The 70's has been a decade of rapid progress.   The  percentage of women in graduate business school has  tripled.   One recent development has been the recognition of unequal treatment of male and female  students in athletic programs and budgets.   Title LX  of the Education Act requires that schools and colleges  evaluate their own practices and take remedial action  where discrimination exists.  It was during the 70*s that the first women priests  were ordained by the Episcopal church   two of them  in Indianapolis.   And the first woman to become a  Rabbi is also serving a temple in Indianapolis. (The  Unitarian-Universalist church is proud that they  ordained Olympia Brown, their first woman minister ,  way back in 1863 )  The considerable increase in the number of women  law students will be reflected throughout the legal  system.   The availability of feminist-oriented lawyers will be of help to women in every area of litigation, and since law often leads to political careers,  we should see more women in state legislatures and  the national congress.   Today women are serving as  governors in Connecticut and Washington, and mayor  of Chicago   I hope to live to see more equal representation in  government    Since women are 51 percent of voters,  we should make up half of the representatives in state  and national legislative bodies.   And I long to see a  woman sitting on the Supreme Court lending a woman's viewpoint to the interpretation of laws.... I  hope someday soon to vote for a woman for president   **     Cdean up 9ol ittcs  ELECT WOMEN  In addition to political power, I want women to gain  more economic power.   We live in a society in which  money is the most powerful force, and yet women are  told to forego having a career - to stay home and rear  the next generation.   We all recognize that our society  would come to a screeching halt if Someone didn't  rear the next generation- -but it is most unfair for women to make all the economic sacrifices-  While she stays home with  her  children, a mother  loses seniority on a job, and gains no Social Security  credits.   Young children need nurturance for these  first important years.   This should be provided equally  by a father and a mother. Young mothers also need a  chance to get away from the suffocating atmosphere  of unending child-care.  Many women in my generation did not pursue  careers,  received no training,  nor accumulated  seniority. Suddenly they find themselves alone,  without any qualifications, needing remunerative  work.   One interesting book I read this summer is  called  How to Raise Independent and Professionally Successful Daughters  by Dr. Rita Dunn and  Dr. Kenneth Dunn.   It points out how much  happier are women who pursue a career throughout life .  Contrary to the popular stereotype,  most of the women in their study had good  marriages and well-adjusted children.  The 1973 Supreme Court decision allowing abortion  during the first tri-mester caused much controversy.  The so-called Right-to-Life forces are working now  to amend the Constitution to make abortion illegal.  Having worked as a counselor in an abortion clinic,  I would never want to have the right to a safe, legal  abortion taken away from women.  I long for the day when each person born into this  society will be treated as an individual with special  traits and talents to be developed to the fullest, regardless of sex.   Little boys will be allowed to be  sensitive and tender, as well as active and aggressive.  Girls will be encouraged to be independent and  courageous, and to make use of all their brains and  talents.     We can no longer afford  the luxury of  wasting half our nation's greatest resources   The women's movement is not going to go away,  but will grow to encompass changes we can scarcely  imagine today.  esther fuller  consultant to women  in business and the professions  assistance establishing new business or making new businesses more profitable  p.o. box 314 zionsville, in. 46077   50.00  per hour 317-293-1612

Somehow,  Somewhere,  Something isn't right  About this story  And her assurance  She left all this behind  For what she's doing now.  by LAUREL SPEER  Untitled  He worked each night 'til seven,  Had social obligations until ten,  But when the marriage finally broke up,  They said that jhe left him.  by SANDY CLARK BOONE  VERSE  Two Poems for Merlin Stone  In predynastic Egypt the female deity of Lower Egypt (north) was the Cobra Goddess known  as Ua Zit.... The Cobra was known as the Eye, uzait, a symbol of mystic insight and  wisdom... . This term, in any context it is used, is always written in feminine form. *  Flower Lady  I    COBRA GODDESS  The slow curve of the ballerina's leap the fall of ripeness  How fatally easy to say    Our Father      but suddenly the stillness  is lit with a woman's hooded figure    and a cobra  leaps to her pointing finger hooded and lovely  they burn against dark in a denying image  I laughed when, years ago, she told me  that she was, after all,  a reborn Augustan;  I could not see that  what appeared to be eccentricity  was merely desperation:  she was no romantic.  She wanted security, promises,  furniture that matched,  old paintings, leaded glass,  but could not have them.  So, to compensate,  pretended that her makeshifts  were her style.  There was some fun,  freedom --  but not to love,  nor want,  nor hope  for anything besides  a transient future.  And times have changed,  but she has not.  She loves the polished verities of Bach,  the certainties of Pope,  paintings verisimilitudinous,  all solid, unchanging, unchangeable:  lacking the excitement of emotion --  and the pain.  byB.E. BALOG  Another Spring  Through the  pinkish-white  flowers  of the stellata  magnolia,   I see  the last  red leaves of the liquid  amber.  The breeze  smells of daphne,  and in the  tangly-garden  of the  family with  the high  foreheads,   the  first camellias  are opening.  My daughter,   in her full  bloom time,   feels her life  is dark and brown and  finished as last autumn's  leaves.  It's catching,  and I want to run away.  by BOBBIE  GOLDMAN  O Mother     Mother       no sounding  of harmony brings truth exactitude of analysis  does not disclose it the color fades  but never in all these autumns      that red-gold question  II    PRISONER  This    is a white  dead lunar landscape  black, though, with a shaft of night where a tall tower lifts  and we think we must be dreaming about Babel  or some triumph of twentieth-century technology  male mastery and nuclear know-how  it is not steam however  that hisses from this arrogant column  a song of sibilant sorrow  we listen with pity but without terror  with pity and rage for an Ancient One  for the Great Snake reared high in Her encircling prison  by  REBECCA E. PITTS     From When God Was a Woman, p. 201.  The Way It Ends  This is the way it ends - - no  bang,   no  whimper;   Don't listen to strange little men who pucker and simper  And say foolish things about how it ends.  It ends  With the lights growing dim  And breath coming ragged  And the heart that was calm for so many years  Now burbling and jittering a rhythm that's jagged,  Then stopping, at last, on a primitive whim.  There's the end to all laughter, an end to all fears.  For those who survive, there are eulogies, tears,  A hopeful hymn that someone sings,  And a stinging ache while a church bell rings.  This is the way it ends.   No  whimper,   no  bang,    Just words said and sung  And a bell that rang.  by MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  Haiku  The pregnant woman  touches her swollen belly  with buoyant wonder.  The Automatic Machine  Between an arched back  deep-knee bends  uncounted steps  and muttered incantations,  clutter clears like magic.  Poised balanced feet  support ballerina arms  stretching until  laundry reappears  clean inside cupboards.  Doors open and close.  Metal scrapes wood  and clangs metal  until sound is muted  by the smell of hot grease  and steaming spice.  Later, fingers move  like sandpiper's feet  splashing suds, then water  over dishes, pots, and silver.  These basics are a few  of the functions performed  by man's greatest  automatic machine  still called  by the ancient name:  WIFE     by   SHIRLEY AYCOCK  Intruder  Crystalline image  expressionless face  intrudes from memory  into my half-waking state.  Ghostlike wisp of guilt  not yet fully formed  floats out from nowhere  to join the image in jigsaw fashion.  Recognition startles  and saddens;  misplaced priorities  win again.  by SANDY TATAY  Circus Act  Your smile--  a stretched taut line  like a tightwire quivering  with little ripples of fear,  tremors that have my arms  outstretched, ready to fly.  by M. YVETTE  HAMILTON  Scrub Nurse  At dawn my room filled with hospital gear,  Awaking me gently,  It's time,   she said,  No comfort was offered nor words of cheer,  Yet we were aware I'd have pain ahead,   I have things to do, can you roll over dear?   She realized I was quaking with dread,  But she never guessed that her calm black face  Washed away my fear of that sterile place.  by MADOLYN  JAMESON  by JUDITH  RAE

Compiled and edited by  Elaine Partnow, Anchor Press/  Doubleday, 1978. Paperback,  542 pages  8. 95. Corwin Books,  1977. Bound 539 pages,  22. 95  Women's Words  More Familiar  A BOOK REVIEW  by JUDITH RAE  (317)   259-BOU  DR.   LIN   S.   DUTHRIDGE  OPTOMETRIST  John F. Kennedy customarily gave Bartlett's FAMILIAR  QUOTATIONS as wedding presents.   THE QUOTABLE  WOMAN - a book of not-so-familiar quotations - would  also make an appropriate present for women and men to  give and receive - on any occasion.  Poet, freelance writer, and actress Elaine Partnow  decided to undertake the enormous task of compiling  and editing THE QUOTABLE WOMAN after she discovered that only 7  1/2  percent of the contributors to  Bartlett's FAMILIAR QUOTATIONS are women and of  the total 117, 000 quotes in Bartlett's collection, only  1/2 of 1 percent (about 600) are those of women. Five  other reference books of quotations have a similar  scarcity of women's writings.  In the introduction to THE QUOTABLE WOMAN,  Anna Balakian (author, professor, and current President of the American Comparative Literature Association) suggests that this volume is more than a book  of quotations.   Its significance could be widespread:  ... one of the greatest disadvantages that women  have suffered in gaining entry into the mainstream of public life, intellectually and  socially, beyond the limits of quotas and tokenism, has been their inability to penetrate the  consciousness and frame of reference of the  central intelligence of society.  THE QUOTABLE WOMAN will make the words of  women more familiar to men, women, and children as their works are quoted in speeches, books, and  periodicals.  Partnow effectively conveys the purpose of THE  QUOTABLE WOMAN in her preface:  ... the public regards women in past and  current history very much like fine character  actors - we recognize them but do not know  their names; we need them but do not pay  them homage; we make demands on them  but do not document their contributions. I  hope that the quotations garnered here will  counteract some of those lapses, that they  will stimulate reading and study, that they  will help retrieve 'lost' women and help  'found' women get some of their own back.  In this well organized reference book, the women  quoted are presented chronologically by date of  birth, starting in 1800.   Their quotations are then  listed in order according to the copyright date or date  of publication.   The chapter number of the cited  book or the stanza of the quoted poem often follows.  The clear directions at the beginning of each section  make the volume easy to use.  If you have ever felt frustrated while searching for  a needed quotation quickly, you will like THE  OUOTABLE WOMAN'S detailed subject index in which  most citations are classified under at least two subject  headings and sometimes three or four.  The Biographical Index is more than just a means  of locating the words of the authors included.   Librarians, writers, speakers, students, and other researchers can use the Index as a concise collected biography of women in world herstory.  The following information is given for each contributor:  full name, birth and death dates, any hereditary  or honorary title, nationality, country of residence  (if different from nationality), family relationship to  well known people, major awards and honors, outstanding achievements, and pseudonyms.   For example,  a person wanting information about Julia Morgan would  read that Morgan was born in 1872, died in 1957, was  an American architect, was the first woman awarded a  degree in architecture from L'Ecole des Beaux-Arts in  Paris, and was the designer of La Cuesta.the Hearst San  Simeon estate.  Because this comprehensive work encompasses females from numerous countries, profession, ideologies, and interests, their quotations are not necessarily  feminist oriented.   Non-feminists such as Phyllis  Schlafly are also included.  The editor and compiler of this major reference  book stated that the project's most difficult task was  to stop:   This is - and probably always will be - an  unfinished work.  Readers are encouraged to add quotations to the blank pages in the back of the book - a  good way to keep the volume updated. (The bound  edition does not have this advantage.)  THE QUOTABLE WOMAN should be on the reference  shelf alongside Bartlett's FAMILIAR QUOTATIONS in  all public and school libraries. (Libraries will want to  get the sturdier bound edition.)  Editor's Note: Call or visit your public library. Send a  note to, or visit your children's school library. Ask if  they have THE QUOTABLE WOMAN.    If they don't,  suggest they order it.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  An   Exorcism  by JILL  CHAMBERS  Being the mother of a 12 year old gun runner is  not an easy job.   It takes examination to discover  how I got the job in the first place.   I didn't exactly  choose it, I somehow though, gave birth to it.  I did not directly, except by default, choose motherhood either.   Choices were few in 1967 when I became  pregnant -- and married --in that order.   I, being by  the act of sexual-love-out-of-marriage-a fallen First  Baptist, believed that abortion was murder, and even  it it wasn't murder, it was illegal in 1967,  There I was in February of 1968, a 20 year old  college sophomore with a relatively new spouse and  a brand new baby.   The first night home from the  hospital was hell.   That perfectly formed, b iggest  of the bunch baby would not nurse or sleep, but oh,  how he could cry    The dream which I had the night  he was born of him controlling the constellations  and stars in the sky and rearranging them to suit himself took on a whole new meaning as he controlled his  father and me.  Being inexperienced and immature, I had a hard  time dealing with the infantile hysteria which lasted  all night.   He was eventually joined in his tears and  screams by his mother who tossed him gently on the  bed and wondered if any of us would survive. However, after his father left for the morning shift at the  factory that sweet little babe drifted off to sleep --  conqueror of all.  How beautiful he was/is.   Chubby and fair with  the most alert little brown eyes, curly new copper-  colored hair and little foot-print freckles across his  nose.   There was no fairer child;and I know I have  deposited several million kisses on his still red head.  Independent, willful, intelligent, beautiful-he  soon napped, slept, ate and played by himself very  well, while his father and I studied and took turns  caring for him.   He was such a good baby.  So how--you may ask--did he become a gun runner  at the age of 12?  His father and I were/are opposed to guns, violence,  and the Viet Nam War, although not necessarily in  that order.    Nevertheless,   our son has always chosen  guns and war games as a primary source of entertainment.  Embarrassed and disapproving when he used his  fingers, sticks, or any object he could find as a gun  and proclaimed  bang, bang   at three, we refused  to buy him toy guns and instructed relatives not to  buy such gifts, no matter how much he pleaded.  When he was six, he started school and started  earning a small allowance for his home chores.  One of his first purchases was a toy gun. And he has  continued to add to his collection.   His arsenal  supplies the neighborhood kids with the toy guns their  parents patiently deny them. When they run through  the yards yelling  bang, bang-you're dead  , the  mothers look at me and wonder, and to tell you the  truth--I do too   How, with my pacifist,  feminist, and otherwise anti  male-war games bias, have I raised this handsome  little boy who corrupts the neighborhood with mock  death and destruction?  Was I wrong to allow him the independence of soul  and bounty to purchase such macho symbols?  Was I  wrong to allow him the choice and the ability to act  beyond my approval?  Despite the toy guns and my sometimes unpopular  status among my peers, my sun has developed a kind  heart.   After watching an older boy trap a gray squirrel  in a tree and kill it with a B B gun, he came crying home  to me.   Angry and sad that his friend had taken the life  of a little animal, he was amazed that his friend had not  fully understood that ultimate act of cruelty.  We've talked.   He knows the difference between play  and real.   That little squirrel was real; the war movies  the neighborhood games are play-acting.   I hope the  others who depend on him for the toy guns know the  difference, too.   I think my son is teaching them.  Several times play has been halted in the respectful  burial of the assorted mice, birds, and chipmunks, that  the neighbor's cat has decimated.   They indicate reverence and show sadness for the death of small living  creatures.   I hope, as they grow up, that this feeling  will extend to larger living creatures.  I pray that their frenzied play now will extinguish  the need for real war tomorrow.   But, we can never  know, except what our own experiences allow- and as  we were blood-thirsty 'cowboys' in our youth, who  grew to have compassion for all humankind, I hope  these children will also.  The Visit  by ANN NOON  The train begins to cross the railroad bridge that  connects Iattovalle to Rome.    You know, this  bridge was never bombed during the war,   The  Americans aimed at it, but never hit it,   my  husband Carlo says to me as we start to leave the  compartment.   As he follows me down the narrow  corridor, I turn my head to answer him:  I know,  your mother told me all about it last time I was here.    The train begins to brake, jerks for a while, and then  finally stops.   We climb down and walk through dusty,  cobblestone streets to a long row of houses, then up the  narrow steps.  Alberta gets up from her chair and we kiss mafia-  style on both cheeks.   We repeat greetings, and then  I'm off to my corner over by the pile of magazines in  the small living/dining room/occasional spare bedroom.  Thumbing through magazines, I glance at Alberta  sitting back in her chair, slippers kicked off, toes  almost touching the floor.   Her legs spread apart, I  can see the tops of her stockings bunched and held by  an elastic band.   I stop myself and almost say out  loud:    Looking up your mother-in-law's dress,  honestly.   Riccardo, her husband, and my father-in-law, picks  his head up from his crossword puzzle and looks encouragingly at his American daughter-in-law and says:   You know the English, I never liked 'em.  They treated me like a dog when I was a  prisoner-of war in Sicily.   Why, I remember  this English, he threw some bread on the  ground and some kid came out an' begged  for it.   He just stomped on it, stomped it  into the mud when the kid went for it. But  the Americans, now, they fed us - funny  eggs and cans of salted pig fat with no meat  on it and that funny sweet white bread that  looked like cotton wool    They gave us dry  eggs in a can, too, and we were only prisoners    Alberta listens, elbows on the table, hands holding  her face.   As soon as Riccardo's finished, she picks up  the cards lying on the table and deals a hand of gin.  Riccardo plays badly.   He never wins.   This time he  loses once too often for him and begins to get sloppy  with his hand.   I look up over my magazine as Alberta breathes out the word  stupid   at Riccardo  slumped over in his seat, asleep.  Carlo, their son and my husband, walks in, passes  behind his father's chair and kisses him on his bald head.  Riccardo doesn't budge.   Then Carlo turns on the TV  to watch a half-finished tennis match.  Alberta looks at Carlo.   Her eyes on the old jeans  that he wears everywhere.   I remember Carlo's  story about when he was in high school and had two  By anyones's standards, particularly by feminist ones,  the Second Annual Feminist Photographers  Ovular   was a giant success.   Held at Rootworks, secluded  women's land in the Southern Oregon mountains, the  nine day ovular ( a newly-issued word for seminar)  drew women from New York, Arizona, Kansas, California, Oregon,  Washington, Indiana, Massachusetts,  D. C, and Canada.   When the sound of cameras clicking (SLR's 2 l/4's, 4X5's and SX 70's) died away, and  the sharing, affirming, growth releasing experience  was over, twenty women committed themselves to  produce a new feminist magazine of photography,  THE BLATANT IMAGE.  THE BLATANT IMAGE'S projected publication date  pairs of old jeans and one good pair of real wool  slacks that he wore to school everyday.    Every night,  Alberta sponged the good slacks off with kerosene.   He  went around smelling like a Molotov cocktail,   but  his pants didn't get shiny in the rear.     God knows,   she says loudly.  God knows,   she  says again, peering out over her glasses. I put down  my magazine and she begins:   Times were hard back then, but the war  never touched us    I mean we were hungry,  who wasn't? The Germans, everyone says  how awful they were.   But here in Iattovalle,  we didn't feel the war when they were here  They just picked up one day and left     I  mean, we didn't know what war was until  you Americans liberated us.   You know,  Carlo's old elementary  school,   she says waving at the TV set be  hind her.    that used to be a hospital be  fore the Americans bombed it.   And,  she says somewnat triumphantly,  when  they liberated the town they really messed  things up     They thought the sacristan and  old Padre Valentino were  German gunners  holed up in the abbey's bell tower.   They  were really shelling them when some kid  I can't remember who, ran up and stopped  them    The priest was more dead than alive  from fright and had to be pulled out of there.     Didn't they find all sorts of strange things when  they rebuilt the abbey?  Carlo asks, leaving the TV  tennis for a moment.   The Americans,   she complains,   rebuilt  the monastery of San Geminiano, but not a  cent to us.   We had to pay for and rebuild  everything here ourselves.   Carlo interrupts again, answering his question with  another one.  Didn't they find bones, babies bones,  under the floor of the bell tower?   His attempt to change the subject over, he returns  to the tennis.   Oh,  that,   Alberta says to me,    I've never  run much after the priests myself,   and eyes a  small colored post card print of John XXIII on  the wall over her sewing machine.   Then she  stands up, puts her hands behind her apron.  Hugging her belly she steps into the kitchen.  I suggest a walk to Carlo.   We bundle up and go  out into the cold, damp, November air.   We walk  for awhile without speaking.   Breaking the silence,  he finally says,   Look, she'll get used to you. It's  just her way.   It takes her awhile.    is June 1981.   We are now seeking practical, personal,  aesthetic,  critical as well as technical articles dealing  with feminist photography, together with photographs  to illustrate them.   Women photographers are invited  to send a favorite photograph of theirs along with about  250 words telling how it felt to take the photo, how or  why it was taken, what the photo means,  and other  relevant ideas.  In addition, up to 5 photographs no larger than 8X10  in black and white, which a woman photographer considers to be her best, most interesting, or most experimental work can be sent to THE BLATANT IMAGE,  Box 56,  Wolf Creek, OR 97497.   Material can be  sent until March 1, 1981 when women from the ovular will return to Rootworks to produce the first her-  storical issue.

        <pagetext>8.  WOMANKIND  How To Be a Cool Mother....  by PAT HEIDENREICH  I asked my sixteen year old,  Do you think I'm  cool?    No, you look pretty hot to me.     I mean *cool', you know, like groovy,   I explained.   Who... you? You gotta be kidding   No way,  man     he laughed.   You mean I'm not even a little cool?  I asked  in a disappointed voice.   Heck no.    Well, then, tell me how I can become a cool  mother.     (I always envisioned being the kind of  mother that the kids and their friends would consider  really great.)   The only way you'd ever be groovy is not to be  a mother.    You mean just because I'm a mother, I'll never  be cool?    That's about the size of it.     Which one of your friends has a cool mother? I  persisted.   I don't know any cool mothers.   They're all just  plain mothers.    There must be some way I can become a really  neat Mom.    Yeah, there is.   When I said I wanted to get a  motorcycle, you could've said, 'Hey, that sounds  like fun.   And since you don't have much money  saved, Dad and I will buy it for you and also pay for  the license and insurance.     And when I said I wanted to stay overnight in that  cave with the underground river, you could've said,     Right on, man. I'll pack your dinner.'   And when I wanted to go sky - diving you WOULDN'T  have said, *Sky-diving    Well, that's better than motorcycle riding.   At least we'd save the cost of months of  hospitalization.   There'd just be the funeral expenses,  'cause splat  and it's all over    He paused for breath.    And when I go out at night,  you could say, 'I'll see you in the morning, 'cause I'll  probably be asleep when you get in.    Since 1 trust you,  I won't worry about you and you don't have to phone in  every hour and tell me where you are.     And you wouldn't keep saying, 'Don't be in such a  hurry to grow up.'   And you'd appreciate my records and quit crabbing  about the volume.     And everytime I get into a car, you wouldn't run out  and ask the kid how long he's had his license and tell  him to drive carefully and stay off the highways and  out of traffic.    And you wouldn't keep bugging me about my room.  I like it to look lived in... it's much more natural. A  cleaned up room is so phony    I interrupted.    That is absolutely ridiculous.   If I  went along with all those things, I wouldn't be a  good mother.    Yeah, I know.   We both sat there dejectedly.   Well then, I guess there's really no way I can become a cool mother.    That's about the size of it,   he sighed.

Seven of the top ten money winners in a total field  of ninety-three professionals and four amateurs graced  the beautiful Harbor  Trees Golf Course on July 3-6,  1980.   Increased  50, 000 from last year, the players  competed for a total purse of  150, 000, in an expanded 72 hole event.  After Thursdays first round, a few new names appeared on the leader board at the Mayflower Classic.  Penny Pulz, a winner for the first time in 1979, was  the leader at 4 under par.   In close pursuit were  veteran players Bonnie Bryant and Kathy Ahem at 3  under par, and an exuberant Kathy young, also 3  under, who stated,  I've never been in a press room  before,   (an honor reserved for the leaders),  this  is a great feeling.   On Friday, Pulz repeated her first round score of  68 to go 8 under par for the  tournament, but the  day belonged to Amy Alcott.   In describing her  round of 65, Alcott explained,   I went out today  (July 4th) and shot some fireworks.   This is one of  the best rounds of my career    I've taken the past  two weeks off, and I seem to play well when I  come back rested.    The wind was a factor on Saturday.   Alcott had to  fight back after bogies on the first and second holes, to  finish the day with an even par 72 which maintained her  tournament lead of 10 under par.  Sally Little, the 1980 LPGA Championship winner,  who is famous for putting low scores on the board made  a real  charge for the lead.   Little, firing 33's on the  front and back nine to go 7 under par remarked,   The  course is playing harder because of a crosswind.   The  wind can change the course greatly, but I hit it well.  I was very happy.    Other challengers were Beth Daniel at 6 under par and   Big Momma  Jo Anne earner at 5 under par.   earner,  demonstrating why she is such a favorite of the gallery  hit a booming 340 yard drive.    My drive at nine was  as long as you can hit it,   said earner, who left only  a wedge shot into the green.   At this point the stage  was set for a terrific final round.  The weather held steady for the golfers all week.  Thunderstorms failed to materialize and sunny skies  prevailed as the fourth and final round began on Sunday.   Alcott, with a three shot lead going into the  final round, by no means had the tournament wrapped  up.   Sally Little and JoAnne earner, two players you  can never count out until the final shots are made,  were still very much in competition.  In characteristic humor, Alcott stated her game plan  was to go for the stick.    I like to knock the stick  down.   I make enough money that I figured I could  afford to buy this club some new pins.     She did just  that with three birdies on the front nine to go 13  under for the tournament.   Holding steady at even  par on the back nine, Amy Alcott, at 13 under par,  became the fourth winner of the Mayflower Classic.  The  22, 500 first place money winner moved into  second place on the money list for this year.  Alcott remarked,   I never felt I had it wrapped up.  ,the  Great American  SMOKEOUT  Smoke-free Sisters  TAKE A DAY OFF FROM SMOKING  NOVEMBER 20,1980  Holding a bouquet of pink roses, Amy Alcott leaves  the 18th green.

LaFourest)  I just wanted to keep it under control on the back. I  didn't feel I had it until I walked off the 17th green.  This was a wonderful event - (Indianapolis provides)  some of the best galleries we have.    Playing solid golf all day, Little almost caught the  leader, but instead had to settle for a tie for second  at 10 under par.   The most dramatic threat to Alcott  came from Carner, who started the day at 5 under  par and ended at 10 under for a share of second place.  A superb competitor,  Carner quipped,   I wish we had  nine more holes.   Ten under would normally win, but  Amy was too tough.    Earning  12, 600 each for their second place tie,  Little and Carner were three strokes ahead of Beth  Daniel and Barbara Barrow, who tied for fourth.  The best finish by a Hoosier professional was Beth  Solomon in a four way tie for tenth.   Kyle O'Brien  of Indianapolis was low amateur.  NOTE:   While in Indiana, Amy Alcott was quoted as  saying,  I want to win. I like seeing my name at the  top of the list.   Anyway,   she went on to add with a  grin,  my Mom's eyes are getting bad, so I told  her  I'd try to keep up in the dark print.    Mrs. Alcott  will have no trouble finding her daughter's name in  the final standings of the 1980 TJ. S. Open.   Amy  Alcott won with a record breaking 4 under par 280,  placing her at the top of the money list for this year.  7461 W. 10th Street  Indianapolis, Indiana 46224  w  Residential  Commercial  Farms  HOMES  BOBBIE BOSE  A Feminist Realtor  Office 271-5555  Residence 244-4876  Anne Selig Marek  Attorney at Law  Divorces     Bankruptcies         Landlord/Tenant     Personal Injury  and other general civil practice  1111 E. 54th St.    251-8234  Indianapolis,    Indiana    46220  American Cancer Society

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Pink collar worker protest  degrading uniforms  Court agrees  NEW YORK (LNS) --  Until a few years ago,  waitresses never complained about their low  salaries.   They didn't realize they had rights. Now  that sexual harrassment is being talked about and  waitresses are going to court over uniforms, this is  bound to affect other waitresses, receptionists, all  workers who are required to dress a certain way  to satisfy male employers,   says Deborah  Siska, a spokesperson for the National Commission  on Working Women.  Relief may soon be available for women who  must wear revealing and provocative clothing on  the job.   A federal district court judge ruled on  June 6, 1980 that Margaret Hasselman, who  suffered repeated and abusive sexual harassment  due to a uniform requirement, could sue her employer under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,  which prohibits employment discrimination on the  basis of sex, race, etc.  Hasselman, who was employed as a lobby attendant  in  a Manhattan office building, informed her employers and supervisors of sexual harassment by the  public.   She was then fired when she refused to wear  the revealing poncho which was her uniform    The  National Employment Law Project and the United  States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  filed suit in 1978 on Ms. Hasselman's behalf, charging the defendants with sex discrimination.  The Court found that no male personnel were ever  required to wear revealing or provocative uniforms,  and that the uniform had an adverse discriminatory  impact on Hasselman's working conditions.   The  court's ruling went on to state that the employer does  not have  the unfettered discretion under Title VII to  require its employees to wear any type of uniform the  employer chooses, including uniforms which may be  characterized as revealing and sexually provocative.'  A similar protest was launched two years ago by  30 women who  worked together at Detroit's Metropolitan Airport, where they were all required to  wear a short red dress with a ruffled petticoat,  nylon briefs and red high-heeled shoes.   The women claimed the outfit subjected them to sexual  harrassment.    I felt like a non-person,   recalled  Judith Marentette,  a 38 -year-old grandmother  who has been waiting tables since she was 15.  For now the class action suit is being held up by a  challenge from the employing company.    But if this  fight, which began through the union, is anything like  the uniform cases that went before it, sooner or later it  will end up in the courtroom.  The court is not the only recourse for working women  who object to their uniforms.   In Dennis, Massachusetts,  two female employees who voluntarily quit their jobs  in an all-purpose store rather than conform to a dress  code specifying miniskirts or short shorts for women  took their case to the Massachusetts Commission  Against Discrimination, where it is pending.   But  first they applied for unemployment compensation,  arguing that they were entitled to the money even  though they quit. Their claim was first refused but was  later upheld by an appeals board that found they had   good reason  to leave the jobs and that the reason  was  attributable to the employer.     In other words,   said their lawyer, William H.  Abrashkin of Legal Services for Cape Cod and Islands,   a woman should not have to put up with that in  order to keep a job.    That sentiment was echoed by New York attorney  Merrick Rossein, hailing the landmark decision in  the Hasselman case.    Women who are forced to  wear degrading clothing on the job in order to cater  to male sexual fantasies,   Rossein said,  will now  be able to assert their legal rights under the civil  rights laws to end these discriminatory practices.   LIBERATION News Service 7/11/80  I BELIEVE IN  WOMANKIND  AND I HELPED PAY FOR  THIS AD   Do  clothes make the woman?''  by  ROBERTA   LYNCH  Rebecca Pitts  Ruth D. Reichard  Cheri L. Kidd  Martha E. Eubanks  Jan Wiste  Susan Murphy  Anita M. Smith  Mary L. Branson  Lynn Hartz  Claudia J. Earls  Becky McNay  Naomi J.

BOX 16306  INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA  46216  It is ironic that the saying goes   Clothes make the  man  when it is in fact women who are most often  made     or unmade --by the way they dress.  Perhaps they didn't say  Clothes make the woman   because it was so close to the unpleasant truth of the  matter.   Perhaps they preferred not to acknowledge  the domination of the fashion industry over individual  preference, the long hours before department store  mirrors, or the urgency of looking  right  by whatever standard prevailed.  The women's movement set out to change all that.  Women should wear comfortable clothes, it said.  Clothes that stayed around year after year like familiar friends.   Clothes that drew attention for their bright  colors or their lively patterns, not for their cut or  their pull.  Although some early feminists may have gone to  extremes in their desire to completely free themselves  from the myths and expectations engendered by female styles of dress, on the whole even ardent femi- '  nists did not stray far from the societal norm. They  were not looking to shock (as so much of the fashion  industry perenially is) but rather to de-emphasize the  role of appearance in women's self-definitions.  In the course of a decade the changes were widespread.   Women of all backgrounds and races began  to choose clothes that complemented their life styles,  jobs, and personalities.   Older women started to pass  up the flowered housedresses to which they'd been relegated in favor of slacks and loose-fitting tops.   Female construction workers strolled the streets in work  shoes, overalls and flannel shirts.   Nurses shifted from  confining straight-skirted uniforms to comfortable pant  suits.  Nor were all the changes on the practical side. For  instance, beautiful silky fabrics that felt as good as  they looked became common. Overall, clothing became more varied and less contrived, more attractive  and less restrictive.  I should have known it couldn't go on that way. Our  dress is, after all, a product of our times. And as the  cause of equality for women has met frustrations and  reversals, it shouldn't be surprising that our clothing  seems to be hearkening back to an earlier time.  To begin with, there are the shoes. High heels are  back in style. Thin high heels. The kind you can't  walk in,  only wobble.  Even more amazing, pointy-toes high heels are  back in vogue.   If ever there was a style that deserved  to be relegated to the dust bin of fashion history, it's  that one.   Not only do such shoes malform your feet  daily, but they force your body to function at a perpetual slant.  Then there's the slit skirt.   I suppose I should be  relieved that women aren't being required to wear  skirts so tight that they can't move their legs more  than two inches in any direction (remember those  days?).   Still, this new version isn't a whole lot  better.   In return for the freedom of movement  provided by the slits, there's the compulsory sexual advertising.  Yet for all its obvious sexual components, this new  look doesn't really represent any greater freedom of  expression for women. Sexually, it is a return to  dress as a form of titillation. It is playing to a male  audience, rather than an emergence of some interior  sense of our sexuality.  Nor is it actually very free.   For all its bravado,  it is essentially a carefully controlled look.   Hair  is sleek and coifed.   Make-up is neat and restrained.  Suits are tailored.   Nylon stockings are a must --  even on the hottest days.

V.  ...EVER NOTICE  PVHEN  THE ECONOMY  TIGHTENS... 60 DO   THE DRESSES    I suppose you could simply chalk it up to the whims  of far-off fashion czars and their ability to shape our  choices.   But I have a feeling that there's more going on than that. It seems to me that it all has something to do with fear and with power.  As more and more women begin to excel in traditionally male fields, there is a reaction on the part  of men.   The fear that they have always had of women --a fear that could be contained by restricting  the female to a limited social sphere -- starts to  assert itself.   Today, men may let women pass them  the hammer or buy them a drink, but there is a deep  underlying resistance to our very presence in  their   world.  Women, with their antennae so finely tuned to  pick up male discomfort, know this only too well.  And we get scared right back.   We fear male fear  -- because with it comes hostility and rejection.  And we're not yet prepared to fully face the consequences of that.  We know that we want more power in the world,  but we are also terrified of losing the only power we've  ever really felt we had -- our sexual power over men.  As a result, I suspect that the new style of dress is  not simply meant to allure, but, more importantly,  to appease.   It is designed to reassure men -- that we  will not venture too far from our assigned place, that  our desire for genuine sexual expression or for economic  equity is still circumscribed by our traditional roles,  that we are not so hungry for political power as to  abandon our more long-standing hungers -- for admiration, for affection, for love.  I may be reading too much into an exposed thigh,  but I think that this latest style is essentially the uniform of guerilla warfare.   In the face of male backlash, we're trying to hold the ground we've taken  by whatever means we can.   We know that we've  come too far to go back now.   Yet we're no longer  sure where  forward  is -- and we're unwilling to  let go completely of what we know for what is stiU  only potential  So,  as in all protracted struggles (and what could  be more protracted than this ancient battle between  the sexes?) there is a time for retrenchment -- for  regrouping our forces, for renewing our vision, for  recharting our course.  This is such a time.

The morning was pungent with the  smell of coal from the railroad yard.   I was seven  and my sister, Marsha, was fourteen.  Wearing only underpants, Marsha was rummaging  around the top half of our shared dresser.   She stood  carelessly, one knee bent, the toe of that foot behind the heel of the other, her young breasts bare as  she worked free the jammed hook of the white  cotton bra dangling from her hand.   I could have boyfriends, too, if I had a bra, and  if I had a big  bazoom  like you      Motherrr, can't you do something about her    Marsha's eyes narrowed behind her glasses as she  said in a voice to me,  You don't have anything  to put into a bra    She then tossed me her newly  perfected haughty look and retreated to the  privacy of the bathroom.  Mama came to the doorway: She wore a black  dress and black shoes with thick Cuban heels. Her  natural black curls glistened and her smooth skin  caught the kitchen light behind her.  The three of us lived in an afterthought of an  apartment in the back of a two-story, white frame  house.   The rooms formed a zig-zag, single file.  They were so tiny that when my mother washed  sheets by hand in the bathroom, my sister and I  would have to snake through both bedrooms with  the tail of the sheet as Mama twisted the water  from her end into the bathtub.  The apartment was furnished in army surplus  and thriftshop furniture; it had been washed down  with Lysol and painted with scrubbable enamel.  The table in the kitchen had come with the house.  On the first night in the house my sister and I  had slept on that kitchen table, wrapped in clean  white sheets, while Mama sat up in a chair all  night, armed with a fly swatter, protecting us  from roaches.   The next day she had sprayed and  scrubbed, and sprayed some more.   After that I  never remember seeing anything more menacing  than an occasional spider.  Our home was stark, but immaculate.   So was  Mama.   The seams in her stockings were always  straight, her shoes always polished.   Her nail  polish was never chipped, and the smell of her  perfume was light and constant.   She had a few  dresses from sometime long ago that were dressy,  but what she wore was usually plain and black.  Once I asked her why.   People are so used to seeing me in black,  they've stopped trying to figure how many dresses  I have or which one they've seen me in last.   That  way I only need two or three good dresses.  She applied the same reasoning to our wardrobe.  We had one dress-up outfit apiece. We could go  to museums, or to the theater, or to the downtown  stores looking as proper as anyone.  Mama was alien to the other mothers on the block.  She was beautiful, a divorcee, and she was determined that we would not be limited by the narrow  visions presented to us in the neighborhood.   She  made sure we knew the world was of our own making,  and absolutely limitless.  Some of my friends' mothers spent hours gossiping  and playing cards, sipping beer at the kitchen table.  Mama spent hours reading, cleaning, coloring paper  napkins with us, and helping us turn walnut shells and  tarnished ornaments into new decorations at Christ-  Free University  526 E 52nd St. Indpls.

We went to free concerts and to  the movies and to fancy restaurants in the middle of  the afternoon when they weren't too busy and we  could just order dessert.  Mama was still standing in the doorway when Marsha  came back from the bathroom wearing a plaid, pleated  skirt and a soft, white sweater which had been drying  overnight on a rack in the bathtub.   Now you get washed and dressed, Faith, and please  comb the tangles from your hair.    Shivering, I rushed to the bathroom: On the way back  I grabbed a pair of underpants and an undershirt.   Then  I crawled back beneath the covers into the warmth still  trapped from my night's sleep.   Within the warm,  dark cave of blankets, I took off my pajamas and  struggled into my underwear, making an even worse  bramble of my hair.   I emerged warm from the  effort, popped on a white nylon slip and the green  and blue plaid cotton dress Mama had hung out for  me the night before.   I then bolted into the kitchen,  announcing that I was ready for school.  My sister took one look at me and rolled her eyes  toward the ceiling with all the drama she could  muster.   Mama just sighed.   Your hair is a sight, Faith    Now you sit right  here on this stool and work out those tangles    She handed me a thick, black-bristled brush,  which I stroked aimlessly along the brown tangles.  Perched on the stool, raking the top layers of  hair, I noticed a curious package Mama was making.  She had taken three bananas from the bowl on the  kitchen shelf and had placed them on a section of  newspaper, opened to its fullest.   She folded the  corners of the paper into a  butcher's wrap  around  the bananas.   I glanced toward Marsha, but she  was reading the fine print on a cereal box.  She did look up from the cereal box when Mama  walked by the table wearing her nubby, black coat,  and carrying the paper bundle.   We watched her go  to the back door and carry the strange package to  the row of metal garbage cans in the alley.   Ours  was the shiny one, the one washed and rinsed each  week before the wrapped garbage went into it.  Mama placed the package on top of the closed lid  of the garbage can, hurried back into the house,  washed her hands,  and hung up her coat.   Why did you do that, Mama?  I asked.  She hesitated for just a moment then said:  Stay  there, by the window.   You'll see.    We waited, kneeling on her bed, peering through  the grim, grey morning.   In the cinder alley, there  was nothing but dead sunflower stalks, withered  hollyhock vines, and small bitter green stink trees,  the drab black and grey and brown of our alley  And then a small shape shuffled toward us from  the distance     The shape gradually bacame an old  woman, tiny, almost sparrow-like, held down by  heavy black skirts that barely cleared the ground  Dark  sweaters and a shawl engulfed her.   A dark,  squashed hat covered most of her face.   She made a  tight, bent bundle as she plodded along, a grimy  satchel dangled by her side.  We watched her work her way up the alley. She  went to each garbage can, searching, looking, her  head bent, her shoulders stooped. Her fingers  groped through the smelly, slimy cans. She would  find something and hold it for a moment before she  either threw it back onto the heap or put it in her  satchel.  As she approached our garbage can and spotted the  package, she hesitated suspiciously, making us draw  back further behind the curtains. Not seeing us, she  opened the package quickly, letting the newspaper  drift to the bricks beneath her feet. The bananas  were quickly stuffed into her satchel as she retreated  back down the alley with a swift, scurrying motion.  We didn't talk about the entrance of the old woman  into our lives.   I sat silently on the kitchen stool  while my mother tugged and pulled at the snarls in  my hair, not once wincing or crying as the big black  teeth of her comb yanked the hair outward from my  scalp.   Visions of the old woman flitted through my  mind.   Again and again I saw the hands that glistened  in the cold, morning light, and saw the grimy satchel  at her side.  Mama smoothed and stretched my hair into two  thick, dark braids while I looked down at the shiny  leather of my brown oxfords.   The fresh, sweet  smell of my mother's perfume surrounded me. I  turned to the pale green table and noticed the  sparkling clean jelly glass and the smooth, shiny  blue china bowl set out for my morning milk and  cereal, and I vowed to comb my hair one-hundred  strokes every night before I went to bed.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  11  Making   It  With   Dividends  by  NORMA J.   GARDNER  As their first female stock broker, it was not easy  for Susan Jamas Jennings.   But Susan proved in the  three years she was at Paine, Webber, Jackson    Curtis, Inc., in Indianapolis that the world of stock-  brokerage is not just for tall men in pin-striped suits.  Susan was not immediately accepted and she remembers that her male co-workers did not take her  seriously. She often felt she was treated coldly.  No  one asked me to go to lunch for months,   she recalls.  However, her manager, with his many years of  business experience, gave her the support she needed.  He recognized Susan's ability to work, and her willingness to sacrifice to obtain certain goals    Today,  her clients and co-workers agree that she did not let  her manager's confidence in her go to waste  Susan's working career began at the age of fifteen  when whe worked in various family business ventures  In college she worked four part-time jobs to finance  her education    As a supervisor saleswoman tor Kelly  Girl, Susan sold their services to businesses that she  contacted    On week-ends she was a clerk in the X-  ray department at a hospital.   During the evening  hours she worked as a waitress in one of the better  restaurants in Indianapolis, and sometimes she was  able to squeeze in substitute teaching whenever  needed.   She taught everything from first grade  music to college accounting .   During this time, she  also carried a full schedule of classes.  During her junior year while working on her  bachelor's degree in business administration at  Butler University in Indianapolis, she decided  to take a break from school. She moved back  to Chicago and became a legal assistant for a  large law firm. It was here that she found herself exposed to the magic of the brokerage industry.   Here was a career where I could literally excel  on my own merits,  Susan says, explaining her  motivation to pioneer in this field.  Interesting enough, Susan has occasionally been able  to draw from the contacts she made through the various  jobs she once held.  One of my best clients was a regular customer at the restaurant where I used to work,    Indiana    Writers'  Conference  An exciting, worthwhile conference for  new   as well as successful writers, poets and photographers  is being planned by the Central Indiana Writer's  Association.   This fifth annual conference will be  held October 4, on the campus of Indiana University  -Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) at the  Student Union Building, 1300 West Michigan Street.  The day will be filled with workshops and round  table discussions.   Heading the list of speakers will  be Shirley Quate, Director of Journalism at IUPUI.  Introducing techniques of  getting into an article   and organizing a story effectively are topics included  in Ms. Quates' article writing workshop.  Elizabeth Christman, author, former literary agent,  and presently a professor at Notre Dame, will lecture  on dialogue, story plot, building a character and  story climax.   Ms. Christman teaches a Fiction  Writing class at Notre Dame.  Other speakers and topics:  Dennis Hensley, from Manchester College, free  lance fiction and non fiction marketing; Ron Engh,  PHOTOLETTER publisher, free lance photography  marketing; David Yates,  CEDAR ROCK, editor and  publisher, poetry lecture and readings.  An evening banquet will conclude the all-day  workshop activities.   The banquet speaker will be  author and photojournalist, Bill Thomas, (THE SWAMP,  AMERICAN RIVERS, and THE ISLAND).  For further information contact:  Central Indiana Writers' Association  Norma Gardner, Director  330 E. Hill Valley Drive  Indianapolis, IN. 46227  or call  (317) 888-9021  CIWA members meet the first Monday of each month  at the Greenwood, Indiana Public Library. A monthly  newsletter is published which is quite useful to beginning and already published writers and photographers.  CIWA is open to all writers in any state. Annual dues  are  10. To join, contact Norma Gardner (see above).  With brown bag and briefcase,  Susan Jennings, now  a stock broker for McDonald and Company in  Indianapolis, leaves her home for the busy day that  lies ahead.   (Photo by N. Gardner)  she laughs.  However, very few of my clients have  come from previous friendships,   she continues.   Nearly all of them originated with a  cold call  introducing myself over the phone.   Most clients will  not make a trade with you on the first phone call. I  find though that they are more polite and will listen  to more oi what I have to say, possibly because I' m  a woman.   But, because I am a woman, it takes  longer to establish confidence.   Clients assume a  man knows what he's talking about; a woman has  to prove she does.     I was a novelty to many of my clients initially.  It was exciting to have a young woman call and talk  aboat their money.   I did get some teasing, since some  of the business buzz words have double meaning, like:   I solicited Mr. X for some business today.     I've only had one or two real uncomfortable situations.   For instance, one new prospect asked to take  me to lunch.   I countered by saying I would take him,  but he insisted.   When we went to the most expensive  restaurant in town I was a bit suspicious, but only  thought he was trying to impress me.   Then he tried  to make a pass.   As tactfully as I could, I avoided it.  The next day I called him and asked for the bond order  anyway.   He gave it to me, and there's been no problem  since,   Serious about people, Susan admits that she often  gets involved with her clients in other money matters.  One woman called her for an opinion on which house  to buy and  the benefits and disadvantages of a larger  mortgage.   The two women had never actually met,  but the client felt mat Susan knew her and her husband and their situation well enough that she could  offer a qualified viewpoint.  Susan's daily routine begins with a thorough reading  of the WALL STREET JOURNAL while having her first  and sometimes second cup of coffee.   When  the  market opens at nine o'clock, she studies the board  making notes of the various changes that will affect  the investments ot her clients.  Contacts are made during the business hours of eight  to five and Susan rarely makes evening appointments  She does attend business meetings held after hours by  large corporations, and finds the knowledge she gains  there enables her to better understand their business  operations.   I also speak before many women's groups,  and I  do seminars on investment alternatives; These engagements are promoted by local libraries as an educational  program,   she says.   Susan encourages couples to attend  these seminars, but stresses the importance of women  being knowledgable about finances and business investments.  Susan's life is not all work.   Her home is located on  ten acres of woods in the suburbs of Indianapolis and in  the evening, Susan and her salesman husband, Brian,  find themselves far removed from the busy schedules  of their two careers.   Some evenings are spent walking through the bird sanctuary which adjoins their  property or perhaps working together in their garden.  Their life away from the business world is like being  on a vacation in this peaceful surrounding and they  both feel they need this balance.  A lover of art and photography, Susan also is a volunteer in the rental gallery at the Indianapolis Art  Museum.   She often assists and advises companies on  suitable art decor.  Susan feels she has accomplished her goals. By  proving her ability, she has been accepted . Her  co-workers respect her and know thac she can produce.  They also know she can handle herself in this  man's  world  as a stockbroker.  Language: woman/man  by MARY BRANSON   The English language evolved in a time when  women were considered inferior and subordinate.  Had the Declaration of Independence stated that   all men and women are created equal  it might  have made a difference in the more than 200  years of legal discrimination against women.  Language is our means of shaping our thoughts  and expressing our feelings. I have never felt  included in the common pronoun  he  or the  term  mankind.  Suppose we use  she  which  includes  he  and  womankind  which includes   man.   Would men feel comfortable with that?  x  13  D   lt;  m   lt;  I   lt;  a:   lt;  O  D   lt;  m  C     lt;       I  O  D   lt;  CQ   lt;       I  C5  D   lt;  CO   lt;  2.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 3  Another Portrait of  In the thirty years since Gertrude  Stein died, allusions to her have  been cropping up with increasing  frequency in both the local and the  national press   sometimes only in  a paraphrase of  a rose is a rose is  a rose is a rose,n but most often in  reference to her intimate connection  with the modern movement in the arts.  Just recently (August 3, 1977) in a  television interview of William L.  Shirer about his new book entitled  20th Century Journal, the first  question asked of him was his  opinion of Gertrude Stein. (He  had met and interviewed her in  Paris in the 20fs.) Shirer s  answer reflects the controversial  nature of Stein's life and work:  the gist of it was that Stein's  egotism had put him off   that her  language had brilliance but no  substance.  Egotistical she certainly was  and she had an overweening faith in  her own genius:  My writings are  clear as mud, she wrote,  but mud  settles and clear streams run on  and disappear.  She sought and  gloried in publicity, but she  knew, as she told Alfred Harcourt  at the beginning of her immensely  successful American lecture tour  in 193k,    Remember this extraordinary welcome that I am having does  not come from the books of mine  that they understand like the  Autobiography but the books of  mine that they did not understand.   She regarded herself  as the major innovator in twentieth  century literature, remarking that  her generation was born to kill  the nineteenth century with its  optimistic faith in science and  progress:  I belong to the  generation that born in the  nineteenth century spent all the  early part of its life escaping  from it, and the rest of it in  being the twentieth century yes  of course.   The alienation of creative  young people   in literature, in  painting, in music   from the  materialism and conformity of  American society about 1900 is  now a truism of cultural history.  It was an alienation revealed in  the great number of Americans who  fled from Iowa or Michigan or New  York to pursue excitedly new modes  of expressing the  new vision   fostered by the experiments of  modern science   particularly by  psychology and physics   and by  modern inventions like the movie  camera. In behalf of new organizing principles, novelists  like Joyce and Virginia Woolf  emphasized pattern rather than  conventional plot, or they plumbed  the minds of their characters in an  effort to reveal the complexity of  the thought stream, or the depths  of the unconscious. Similarly, poets  such as Pound, Eliot, Hart Crane,  Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore and  many lesser poets since, repudiated  traditional form and idiom. Inevitably the chief concern of  these moderns was technique rather than content   the  how   rather than the  what . In  other words, they explored the  resources of their medium-Ian-  Gertrude Stein  (lQ7k-19l*6)  guage   very much as the abstract  painters were doing.  Gertrude Stein never regarded  herself as an expatriate.  I am  an American,  she said,  and I have  lived half of my life in Paris, not  the half which made me but the half  in which I made what I made.  In  fact, she identified herself as a  western American, whose qualities  she listed in a college theme as   freedom, imagination, and uncon-  ventionality.  But expatriate or  not, she exemplifies the break with  the past so vigorously pursued by  Americans abroad both before and  after World War I.  The biographical details of her  life show the extent to which she was  a rebel against the nineteenth century. As a child she was fortunate     as she put it    privileged.  Her  family roots were in Baltimore, to  which city her German Jewish grandparents had emigrated from Austria  early in the nineteenth century,  and where in her youth her affluent  Keyser and Stein relatives still  lived. The youngest child of  Gertrude Stein  Daniel and Amelia Stein, Gertrude  was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania,  spent her babyhood in Europe, and  her childhood and adolescence in  East Oakland, near San Francisco.  Here her father laid the foundation  for the sizable fortune that after  his death provided, under the management of his son Michael, a  competency for all five of the Stein  children for the rest of their lives,  giving them freedom and independence.  In the old Stratton house in East  Oakland, the Stein children lived a  half-city, half-country life, reading  a great deal, going to San Francisco  for music and theatre, tramping  over the countryside at will. In  spite of dull governesses and the  intermittent schedules of exercise  and dieting initiated by their  father, they had a comparatively happy  and secure life. For Gertrude Stein  neither of her parents seems to have  been important: her mother was  apparently a rather ineffectual  little woman, and her father a  self-confident, somewhat dictatorial man, whose high-handed wavs no  doubt contributed to her remark  about fathers:  There is too much  fathering going just now and there  is no doubt about it fathers are  depressing.   The major figure in her early life  was her brother Leo, who,  two years  older and a man,  more or less dominated her until she was nearly  thirty.  They -were childhood companions, lived together part of  the  time in Baltimore after their father's  death, and traveled abroad together  during summer vacations. She  followed him to Harvard and later,  when he settled in Paris, she joined  him in the now famous apartment at  27 rue de Fleurus. As she began to  write and to express opinions of her  own, sibling rivalry inevitably  flared up. But the break between  them did not come until 1913 gt; some  years after Alice B. Toklas had  joined them. Leo took uo residence  in Italy.  Unlike most young women in 1890,  Gertrude Stein was financially independent and therefore free to  choose a career. Thus it was that  she attended Radcliffe College in that  fortunate time when George Santayana  and William James were both teachers  of philosophy at Harvard and when  James was doing pioneering work in  psychology. Stein's experimental  work in psychology led to the  writing of two scientific articles  published in the Psychological  Review:  A Study of Normal Motor  Automatism  (done with Leon Solomons,  her partner in the experiments);  and   alone    Cultivated Motor Automatism.   These researches resulted in her life-long interest  in patterns of human behavior,  exemplified later in her prose  fiction: Three lives (1909),and  The Making of Americans (1925). It  also seems probable that her language  experiments were in part guided by  James's discussion of the stream of  thought, in his great textbook on  psychology.  From Radcliffe Stein entered Johns  Hopkins Medical School, intending  cont'd, to Page h

        <pagetext>Page k  WOMANKIND  G. Stein-cont'd from Page 3  to become a psychological pathologist. There under the direction of Llewellys Barker, she  worked on a model of the brain,  tracing some of the brain-tracks     research which was later cited by  Barker in The Nervous System with  its Constituent Neurones (1899). For  some reason, perhaps boredom, she lost  interest in a medical career and in  her last year she flunked out of  Hopkins. After a time of uncertainty,  she joined Leo in Paris and so began  her life in France. Soon the brother  and sister began to buy paintings, to  hang them on the walls of their  atelier, and to cultivate the  artists, chief among them, Matisse  and Picasso.  Stein always said that she was   with  cubism from the first, and  true to her first love, when she  died it was the paintings by Picasso  and Braque that made up the bulk of  the fabulous collection purchased  from her estate by the Museum of  Modern Art. As she said in her  essay on Picasso,  the twentieth century is  a century which sees the  earth as no one has ever  seen it, the earth has a  splendor that it has never  had, and as everything  destroys itself in the  twentieth century and  nothing continues the  twentieth century has  a splendor which is its  own and Picasso is of this  century.  She identified her writing  with cubist painting, declaring  that she was doing in writing what  they were doing in painting. She  had actually begun to try her  hand at fiction even before she  settled down in Paris in 190ij. gt;  already revealing innovative  elements in her style in the  narrative sketches of  Melanctha ,   The Good Anna,  and  The Gentle  Lena,  the three pieces comprising Three Lives. She was an  anecdotalist, never a storyteller, and before she was  either, a psychologist with a  psychologist's interest in  analysing and classifying  people. Then in the midst of  writing the long novel The  Making of Americans Gertrude  Stein was caught up in the  excitement of pieces of writing  as artifacts, linguistic constructions, objects among objects in the world.  The impact of cubism was  crucial. Abandoning surface  realism, she turned to the  analysis of the motions of her  mind in moments of concentration. Writing a little every  day, usually at night, she  experimented, employing many  different techniques and devices  in numerous pieces called   portraits  and  plays  during  the next quarter of a century  (1908-1932). The first of her  compositions printed was  A  Portrait of Mabel Dodge at the  Villa Curonia,  later published  by Alfred Stieglitz in Camera  Work, along with her  portraits   of Matisse and Picasso. The  most important work of this  first period was undoubtedly  the group of  still-lifes   published as Tender Buttons (191U).  One of the literary curiosities of  modern literature, this little book  in spite of its unintelligibility  contains some of the most moving and  beautiful lyrical passages Stein ever  wrote.  Just after the publication of  Tender Buttons came World War I,  during which Stein did little writing    Here is her account of the war years  as told in the Autobiography of Alice  B. Toklas:  Then came the war, and Gertrude  drove a Ford car called Auntie,  and visited hospitals, and was  decorated by the French Government with the Medal of the Reconnaissance Francaise. She  ended her work entering Alsace  with the French Army.  After the war, all roads led to  Paris. For the next decade or more,  the atelier at 27 rue de Fleures  became the mecca for a new group of  young Americans abroad, and whereas  the Stein salon before the war had  been chiefly frequented by artists  who came to see the pictures, it  now became a definitely literary  salon. It had been said that there  were few poets who she did not know  before they published their first book  of poems and few novelists who did  not come to her before publishing  their first novels. Best known  of the American writers were  Sherwood Anderson, Ernest Hemingway, and Scott Fitzgerald. With  Alice B. Toklas assisting, Gertrude  Stein presided over the Saturday  evenings to which everybody who was  anybody came   some to scoff, some to  listen reverently to Gertrude Stein  talk in her beautiful contralto  voice. And her reputation grew.  And she continued to write and  occasionally succeeded in publishing.  In 1933 Stein was catapulted into  fame by the publicity attendant upon  the publication of the autobiographical  work called Alice B. Toklas, which became a best seller and led to her  American lecture tour of 193lu  After thirty years abroad, she  returned triumphantly, accompanied  by Alice B. Toklas, to find her book  in the windows of Fifth Avenue shops,  her picture in all the papers, and  reporters eager for interviews where-  ever she went. She lectured on the  campuses of dozens of colleges and  universities all over the United  States, flying everywhere and everywhere lionized to her heart's content.  An international celebrity, she returned to France and pursued the  regular course of her life writing  and publishing, spending her time  between Paris and the valley of the  Ain. It was there in a house she  had leased in 1929 that she and  Alice spent the years of the  second world war, an account of  which is given in Wars I Have Seen.  When she died at the age of 72 she  had achieved her goal of becoming   historical.   During her life time Stein was  often ridiculed or condemned, her  detractors variously calling her   a charlatan,   high priestess of  occult,n  a clever Jewish woman  with her tongue in her cheek,    a performer of word antics,   and a  crotchety old maid suffering from maladie de grandeur.   Attacking the whole modern art  movement, Windham Lewis in Time  and Western Man called her a  Allegra Stewart  author of  Gertrude Stein and. the Present  faux naif, a sham, a jazz-sibyl,  an Epstein in words, and  a  monument sitting on patience.   And while granting her robust  intelligence, he accused her of   playing her own personal literary  game  and of wooing  irresponsible,  light-hearted madness and ignorance,   After the American lecture tour  reviewers were on the whole less  nonplused by her obscurities than  amused by her, and the titles of  some of the reviews are clever:   Her Words Do Get Under Their Skin,    One Stein in Two Acts,   Gertrude Stein, Method or Madness,    Cheating at Solitaire,   Gas-  Goddess,  and  Self-Confidential.   Throughout her life, however, she  had loyal friends who believed in her,  admired her, and helped to publicize  her work. Sherwood Anderson called  her work  the most important pioneer  work done in the field of letters0n  Paul Rosenfeld said that her place in  literature was close to the sources of  the new American movement,  prophetic  of its direction.  And some characterized her as  the one genius of modern  American literature.   Under the general editorship of her  long-time friend Carl Van Vechten,  since her death eight volumes of her  unpublished writings have been published by Yale University, by such  loyal old friends as Janet Flanner,  Virgil Thomson, and Donald Gallup.  She has been the subject of doctoral  dissertations, college seminars,  critical articles and a number of full  length biographies and volumes of  criticism. Though the scope of her  influence has yet to be gauged, it is  generally known that her verbal experiments influenced James Joyce and  that Hemingway's debt to her is apparent  both in his style and method of characterization. Van Vechten owed to her at least  in part his interest in the Negro, Eugene  O'Neill owed something to her studies of  primitive types.

There's no safety at the Baobob tree,  The branches reach down too invitingly.  They form low platforms where the leopard  Can laze through the heat, the while on guard  From those who hunt him.

The ghost of a house cries across the way,  Its grass now gravel; the front steps stand sentinel  And lead the faded visitors to an empty parking lot.  Janet E. Rash  BOOK REVIEW       From childhood, a man is programmed for financial responsibility.  In contrast, women are taught to be  supportive, choosable, and subject  to their families' needs and  desires.  So say Dee Dee Ahem and  Betsy Bliss in their informative  and sometimes disturbing book   The Economics of Being a Woman ,  Whether you are a housewife, a  student, a well-paid executive,  or a radical feminist, statistics  show that you are not in control  of your economic future, and this  book points up some of the areas  where women are being exploited  or devalued. It explores the  economic life of women in the  past, in terms of economic history; the present, in their  economic contributions today;  and the future, with a view of  future economic growth. Ms. Ahem  and Ms, Bliss point out many forms  of discrimination that are either  so subtle as to be ignored, or so  common that they are completely  accepted. They discuss money  sources, economic standing,  fringe benefits, social security,  taxes, and the subject of marriage, divorce, and widowhood.  With their backgrounds in financial consulting and reporting,  (Ms. Ahem has researched womens  role in the economy and Ms. Bliss  is a correspondent for the Chicago  Daily News and Commercial and  Financial Chronicle), they obviously possess knowledge of  money matters, and have done their  homework well.  The general theme of the book  would seem to be the  total  picture  of women's contributions  to the American economy and the  disproportionate benefits they  and their families receive in  returno It is well worth the price  of  8,9 ? in terms of awareness and  financial planning,   r  ROBERTA K. BRODERICK  The ghost's tears are made tangible  in cloud apparatus  Consensed, and magnetized by the earth,  And crouch low to dive  And cascade as one glacier sheet of warm ice  Soaring down the stoop.  It's a day for knees touching in camaraderie  And the comfy smiles of paunchy middle age  While the iced coffee sings to us of Christmas,  Doreen Christian  PAYROLLS  and  BOOKKEEPING  SERVICES  JOSEPHINE  LAWRENCE  251-3271

I dropped the frying pan back into the dishwater and we ran ,  hopping over the toys on the floor to the bathroom and the little potty chair.  I helped him with his training pants and he sat down.. .just  long enough to take the weight off his feet and then jumped up  and looked into the potty.   No coming, Mommie.   All gone.   Considering this was the twenty-fifth false alarm of the morning and these false alarms were interspersed with one messy and  seven wet training pants, I decided that I'm not the expert I  thought I was.   With the valuable experience of teaching the  older kids to keep their drawers dry, I figured I'd have the baby  trained within a few days.   Now, after months of trying, both  the sitting down and standing up techniques, I'm considering  pinning a note on his shirt for the kindergarten teacher saying,   He's not trained.   Good Luck   and forgetting the whole  deal.  Even my famous  sink the boat  routine is failing.   With the  other two boys it worked wonderfully.  I'd wad up a big hunk  of tissue, toss it into the commode and they would sink the boat.  The latest student just stands there, though, and watches the  boat sink by itself.  The old  running water  bit works good... .on me.   As I exit  to the other bathroom, the baby toddles over to the sink and  plays with the water.  And then there's the social pressure.   Other mothers keep  telling me how their kids were completely trained before their  first birthday. (Big fat deal )  They tell me,  You gotta keep him in training pants and  watch for his signals.    But his only signal is a puddle on the floor,   I say,  or else  another false alarm.   This whole deal is so depressing.   I 've read extensively on the subject and the experts say not  to show concern, not to put pressure on the kid and don't make  him feel guilty for occasional accidents. (Occasional, HA )  Well, let me tell you, I'm getting pretty tired of saying,   Oh look    another puddle.   especially when my boats  keep sinking by themselves.  And the older two boys and their Daddy are getting tired of  demonstrating. And we all keep tripping over the darn little  ste ' in the front of the john.  The boys have even shown him their old  bow and arrow   bit, where they make their streams cross in mid-air.   He was  truly delighted, but didn't have any contribution to make to  the pageant.  I told myself, I must be relaxed. After all, did I want to be  the cause of some awful phobia or something that will manifest  itself later in the kid's life? I decided to try a song and dance  routine   It's time to potty...cha... cha...cha.  He'll do a lotty...cha...cha...cha.    at least he's learned how to dance his way into the bathroom to watch the boat sink by itself.  Every morning I blow the dust off the tamborine and check the  confetti that I keep on the back of the john.   One of these days  we're gonna have the darndest celebration the world ever saw    I hope.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 7  Spring had come early to the  mountains that year, raking back  the last bits of snow and loading  the trees with green shoots which  gave promise to a summer filled with  shade. The smell of wet, rotting  wood mingled with the crisp tartness  of new life breaking through the  ground.  Cloye felt she could never understand so well why creatures get born  into the world to die as she understood when the spring came and the  knowledge came with it. The flowers  grew and the bees dug into their  nectar, and honey was made for Mam  to gather. Life was sweeter with  the honey, and the coming and going  of life was part of it all. Behind  her the smoke curled from the chimney of the one-room cabin that Pa  had built for Mam when they were first  married. Cloye watched as a slight  breeze hooked itself into the curl of  smoke, tossing it down upon the roof  to slide off scaly logs on the cabin's  sides.   Cloye,  her mother's voice called  from below,  git that bucket on here.  I ain't got time for you to moon a-  round while there's work waiting.   Cloye grabbed her bucket and her  daydreams, the heavy pail bumping  against her skinny legs as she shifted  its weight in hurrying to obey Mam.  She could see her mother in the distance,  round hips swinging in rhythm to the  singing birds gathering materials for  nests they would build high in the trees  trees running along the mountains  trail. Cloye looked down the trail,  noticing how it curved among those  tall trees, skirting around hickory  and walnut, intruding through a bed of  Sweet Williams, and on, until it  paused at the point where the nearby  stream fell into a pool of clear  water. She saw that her six-year-  old brother Sid had plopped down on  the trail ahead and knew he whined  because he needed her. Stumbling  downward she hurried to help him before  Mam turned.   Oh, Sid,  she muttered when she  saw the drinking pitcher broken and  scattered on the rocks around him.  Sid glanced up, his blue eyes beginning to flow like the stream until they fell into his open mouth.   It's alright, baby, Cloye fix it,   she soothed as she began to pick up  the broken pieces and put them in  her pocket.   Cloye,  Mam yelled from the pool,   leave that big baby sit up there till  the bears come and eat him up. You git  down here       Hush, Sid. Hold my hand. Ssh, I'm  going to help you,  Cloye whispered.  She took his thin, white hand into her  small tanned one and juggled the pail  as best she could.  Mam was on her knees bending over  into the pool when Cloye arrived  dragging Sid, still whining, with her.   He went and broke another pitcher,  didn't he?  Mam asked out of the  guggling water. Cloye shook her head  and then remembered to say  yes  to  her mother's back.   He didn't mean no harm,  she said  cautiously.  Early Spring   He don't never mean no harm,  the  voice above the water answered quietly.   He's like your Pa, always doing harm  and never meaning bad by it.   Cloye sighed, satisfied that for the  moment Sid had been saved from the  switch. She picked him up and stood  watching as her mother dipped the  water into the rusted tin bucket.  Cloye thought Mam the most beautiful  woman she had ever seen. Sometimes  when the evening fire was banked high  with logs, her mother's face would  grow pink and her lips would become  cherry red. She would sit before the  flames combing out her mass of red  hair and Cloye would sigh in the  wonder of the colors while brushing  back a few strands of her own brown  curls, wondering why Sid had been  born with her mother's beauty. She  never begrudged Sid that beauty,  but loved him all the more for it.  Mam finished filling her bucket  and wiped her forehead, against  her feedsack apron. She sat down  on a rock jutting over the water  and stared further down the trail.  Cloye watched as the early morning  sun caressed the curve of her  mother's profile.   That boy's too big fer you to  baby now,  Mam said into the air.   He ain't going to let loose of  your skirt if'n you don't pull  away soon.    I don't mind,  Cloye answered,  rubbing her face against Sid's  face.  Mam turned with fury in her voice.   When you going to learn that most  times it don't make no difference  whether you mind or don't mind  about things. That youngen is almost  as big as you are.   Sid began to whine again and dug  his fists into his eyes. Mam sucked  her lips together, making the little  whistling noise that meant she was  tired to death of talking about it.  Cloye knew she did that a lot with  Pa, but she didn't know why, she  only knew it made Pa afraid.   Cloye, honey, there ain't no  good of making a baby into a half-  man,   Mam whispered, turnin g away  to look down the trail again.   Git your bucket filled.   Cloye gently set Sid on the  ground and told him to look for  bear prints on the bank of the  stream. She smiled at him as he  trotted off, and hoped that maybe  a fat possum or crafty fox had  left a print along the bank for him  to find. Sometimes, when they  arrived at the pool early enough,  small furry animals would scurry  back into the thickness of the  woods. Cloye was glad that life  always held out something, if not  bear tracks then a possum would do.  Satisfied that Sid was happy, she  lifted her dress and bent over to  dip up the water.  Mam stood up restlessly and  kicked at loose rock.   Cloye,  she said turning large  blue eyes in her direction,  you're  going to have to kill the hen today.   Cloye stopped dipping and watched  the reflection of her face bobbing  up and down in the water.   Don't stare off, girl, your daddy  deserves a good meal onct in a while,  besides it's time you git on with  growing up.  Cloye pushed away the reflection  of her face in the water, her long  straight nose fluttered into her  square chin.   I don't like seeing the chicken  flopping around,  she said to Mam.   I don't like it flopping and dying  like that.    Oh honey, it don't feel no pain.    When it's jumping like that...it  just don't seem right...everything in'  the whole world...the spring come  early and I don't like it.    You ain't making no sense,  Mam  said harshly,   We got to eat. When  are you going to learn, youngen, that  life don't always make do for you.    Cloye,  Sid squealed from up the  stream.  Cloye dropped the dipper and  scrambled along the bank. Mam  followed behind, careful not to step  on a sharp rock with her bare feet.   What's the matter, baby,  Cloye  asked, as she reached Sid and. quickly  began the search over his body with  her eyes.   I see'd a man's print,  Sid said  excitedly,  as big as a bear's.    Mam, there's some man's print up  here,  Cloye called back as her  mother ambled slowly up the stream.  Mam looked up and hurried toward  the print. She pushed Cloye aside  and stood looking down.   Some hunter, I reckon,  she said  too quickly.  You youngens come away  from here and help me git the water  home.    But I ain't heard no shooting,   Cloye said.  Sides that, it ain't  no boot print.    I said git,  Mam shouted jerking  Sid away. He began to cry again.   No need of doing that, Clea,   a man's voice spoke out of the woods.  Cloye and Mam jumped with the  sound and looked across the water.  Cloye noticed first the way he  leaned against the tree as though  all day was waiting while he leaned  there, and he smiled as if that too,  he could do all day, only not a happy  smile, she thought. He was tall, lanky  like a young birch, and his dark hair  framed a handsome, childish face. He  looked at Mam as though she belonged to  him. Cloye drew close to her mother as  if to protect her.   What are you doing here, Shafter?   Mam asked quietly, her breath coming  in rapid and fluttery.   I come to get you, Clea,  he answered,  taking a step toward the stream.   You leave my Mam alone,  Sid shouted  picking up a stone from the bank,   Put it down,  Cloye said softly.  Somehow she knew Mam wasn't afraid.   I ain't got time for youngens, his  youngens, Clea,  the man answered,  shrugging his shoulders as if he really  didn't have time for anything.   Shafter, you ain't asking me to  leave my youngens standing on this  creek bank, are you?   cont'd, to page 10

        <pagetext>Page 8  llMHPBBIBBlBBHiaHlilllS  This recipe was submitted to  WOMANKIND by our Vietnamese  friends in Indianapolis,  Khieu T. Vu and Bourn T. Vu.  Vietnamese E g Roll  The ingredients for this dish  can be purchased in Korean or  other Oriental food stores.  1. Package rice paper (makes about  100 egg rolls)  2 lbs. ground pork  h   egg yolk  2 or 3 dried mushrooms  2 pinches black pepper  1 t. sugar  1 package rye noodles  1 fresh garlic  h   green onion tops chopped fine  1 t. Monosodium glutamate (MSG)  Place dry mushrooms in warm water to  soak while mixing other ingredients.  Mushrooms will  blossom11 (expand)  while in water. When ready to use  be sure it is throughly washed to  remove all sand and dirt particles.  Place Rye noodles in warm water to  soak   this will soften them.  Mix all ingredients except rice paper,  noodles, and mushroom in large bowl.  When noodles and mushroom are soft  and expanded combine with pork  mixture.  It is necessary to cut noodles and  mushrooms kitchen sissors would be  handy for this procedure.  Rice paper should be at room temperature to allow easy removal. If it  tears, dip it in luke warm water.  This will enable easy rolling and  assure closure of ends.  Pork, spices, noodles and mushroom  mixture are then placed in rice  paper and rolled up. Egg rolls are  fried in very hot oil turning to  assure even browning. The heat may  need to be reduced from time to time.  Always eat egg rolls while hot. If  some are left over, refrigerate and  heat at a later date by wrapping in  aluminum foil and placing in oven.  Egg rolls are good at any time and  as an added pleasure to any meal.  SEPTEMBER  WOMANKIND  G. Stein-cont'd from Page U  apparent that her influence is still  being felt   that her stylistic techniques have focused the attention of  younger writers upon their own style  and that consequently they are mining  her most hermetic works for the ore  from which they are hammering out  their style.  Today she is probably known to  more people by name than any other  writer of the century, and the  features of no other are so well  known, for she was endlessly painted and photographed. Her most  famous portrait is the one painted  by Picasso in 1905 at the beginning  of cubism, and now hanging in the  Metropolitan Museum in New York.  Lipshitz and Jo Davidson sculptured  her, Cecil Beaton photographed her     as did many, many others, both  amateur and professional. The  readers of Life and, Time, Vogue,  Mademoiselle, and Harper1s Bazaar  became familiar with her sandals,  her full skirts, her shirtwaists,  her knitted vests, her stocky  figure and her fine head with the  cropped hair and ageless eyes. We  have heard of her beautiful voice  and hearty laugh, always remembered  by those who met her. The exhibit  called Four Americans in Paris,  mounted in 1971 by the Museum of  Modern Art in New York, had as its  nucleus Stein's unparalleled collection  of cubist paintings   38 by Picasso, and  9 by Juan Gris. At about the same  time as the exhibit a ninety-minute  television show was produced for NET  and the BBC and is now available for  showing at museums and schools.  It is of interest that, according  to a biographer, Richard Bridgman,  Gertrude Stein during her Radcliffe  days once gave a talk on  The Value  of College Education for Women,    (largely based on Women and Economics)  by Charlotte Gilman), in which she  said among other things that  under  ordinary conditions, a woman would  not be dominated by the  sex element,     for she  is an individual first and  a member of a sex only when the time  of functional usefulness begins.  She  urged higher education, assuring her  audience that an education does not  tend to unsex but to rightly sex women.  And no article on Gertrude Stein  should appear in Womankind that  does not speak of Stein's last  opera,  The Mother of Us All,   based on the life of Susan B.  Anthony. In the opera Susan  Anthony asserts the over-all  superiority of women: men are   conservative, selfish, boring, ugly,  gullible, unchanging, and bullies.   They are  poor things    pitiful,  blustering, fearful creatures   yet  they have the power.  Men do not  know that two and two make four  until women tell them so.  But  though Susan Anthony struggled,  she was repeatedly frustrated in  her battle for  female emancipation.   Maria Parloa whose influential textbook, First Principles of Household Management and Cookery and numerous  helpful pamphlets and cooking schools led to the development of home economics as a science, born, 1843.  3 ouieb  jw SloMaine  PHONE 545-3184  Weddings and Catering  Our Specialties  wm  teleflora   Florufax)   2   r* Ph  ne Service  793   EAST 30th at FRANKLIN ROAD  INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA  U0219 LORRAINE GOWEN ,  One of the choruses of the opera sings:  Susan B. Anthony was very  successful we are very  grateful to Susan B.  Anthony because she was  so successful, she worked  for the votes for women  and she worked for the vote  for colored men and she was  so successful, they wrote  the word male into the  constitution...  Stein was a great personality  and served as a kind of catalytic  agent for others, stimulating their  creativity in countless ways. Her  very courage in continuing to write  in the face of ridicule and neglect  encouraged self-reliance and nonconformity. Above all in her advice to writers, she urged authenticity. She was fond of saying  that you cannot serve God and  Mammon, and that  while you  create you do not exist. We live  in time and identity but as we  are we do not know time and  identity.  Her favorite example  of the moment-out-of-time which  permits wholeness of being-  she called it  entity    was Robinson  Crusoe's discovery of Friday's footprint.  Sherwood Anderson conveyed  a prophetic note when he exclaimed:   Would it not be a lovely and  charming ironic gesture of the  gods if, in the end, the work of  this artist were to prove the  most lasting and important of all  the word slingers of our generation.   Certainly she is very much a presence  today in her native land.  Allegra Stewart  APPAREL  1412 - 3212  32-54  YOUTHFUL  STYLES  Moderately Priced  Mon.-Sat.  10-7  4771 N.

These are all  part of Dena McGevern's job in the  Indianapolis Police Department and  is the first woman in the Vice  Squad. Dena is a young and attractive woman. She is divorced and  has two children. Her children  accept their monther's job. Dena  herself finds it challenging and  exciting and she always looks forward to coming to work.  Dena's job in Vice Squad  consists mainly of making arrests  for prostitution and gambling.  Dena and a co-worker, Mike, frequently pose as husband and wife.  Together they go to bars and make  arrests for nude dancing, gambling,  and prostitution.  For four nights once Dena posed  as a hooker. She street-walked from  22nd to 23rd Street along Meridian  and made a total of 30 arrests.  Another time she posed as a prostitute and went into a massage parlor  to apply for a job. The interviewing stopped when she was asked to  disrobeI  Other arrests Dena has made involve male prostitues and female  impersonators     Dena has been a police officer  for one year and she had the same  training as all the men on the  force had. She had to go to the  policy academy for four months.  Among other things, while there  she practiced on a firing range,  did two hours a day of physical  Ectivities, and ran two miles per  ay.  DENA MCGEVERN of The Indianapolis Police Department  The only requirements one must  meet to become a police officer  are having a high school education  having studied law, and having  taken a course in first-aid.  Dena feels that the job doesn't pay  well enough for the work she does.  'The starting salary for a police  officer is  10,000. per year.  Although she really likes her  job, this sometimes causes Dena  to wonder,  Why am I still here?   Dena is 30 years old and held  other jobs before coming to the  Police Department. She worked  in advertising at Paul Harris.  Another job she had was teaching  drama to teenagers.  Dena has arrived at a career  she feels good about.  I feel I  am doing something important. It  really affects you mentally, especially when you make a good arrest,  and you know the crime was really  committed, but you lose the case  in court.  Dena has had some exciting  moments. She has had some doubts  too, but she sums it all up with  this example.   The first time  I drew my gun, my heart went to  my throat.  Now Dena doesn't  hesitate.

        <pagetext>Page 10  WOMANKIND  Early Spring cont'd from Page 7   I ain't coming back here no more to  git you,  the man muttered, turning  toward the trail.  Them youngens  know their way home.   Cloye and Mam watched him start to  walk away. Mam's feet curled into the  mud.   Wait,  she cried, lifting her  skirts and splashing through the  water.  Cloye put her arms around Sid's  shoulders as she felt a tightness  pulling behind her eyes. There  was a quietness in the spring  trees, like before the wind came  in a summer's storm to tear a-  way branches.  Mam stopped on the other side  of the water and turned to face  Cloye.   Take care of your brother,  Cloye, but don't baby him no  more. Tell your Pa ain't no  use coming to look for me,  he'll understand, and take  that water on to the house.  The man continued to walk  down the trail and out of  sight. Mam's eyes darted to  Cloye and down into the woods.   I ain't got no choice.  Your daddy's a lot older than  me...sometimes you just gotta  make life do for you,  she  shouted as she ran after him.   I want my Mam,  Sid screamed.  Cloye patted his head as her  eyes weaved in and out of the  trees trying to imagine how her  mother's blue skirt and red  hair would be billowing on the  trail below. She watched until there was nothing left to  imagine.   No more use of crying, baby,   she told Sid. She wiped the wetness from his face and looked  back up the trail, trying to  find the curl of smoke which  would let her know everything  was as it should be there.  The cabin seemed so far away,  lost among the budding spring  trees and careless breezes.   Mam said to git the water home.   Cloye had to make two trips  to the pool for the water and  forgot to look for new nests  along the trail. She took  the hen, fat from winter  feeding and wrung its neck.  Then she sat down and turned her  face until she knew the flopping  had stopped.  When her father came home from  the mines, the chicken was bubbling  in a gravy of flour dumplings. He  lifted the heavy mining cap from  his head and Cloye could smell the  bitter stench of the carbide.   Where's your ma?  he asked while  washing the blackness from his face  and hands in the pan of water Cloye  had ready for him.   I don't reckon she'll be coming  home,  Cloye said as she flipped a  hot piece of cornbread onto his  plate.   She off visiting again?  he asked,  sitting down heavily. The dust from  his clothes settled below his chair.  He began to stuff the bread into his  mouth.   I guess she's gone off with some  man,  Cloye whispered.   She went off with a man in the  woods,  Sid shouted, grabbing a  piece of chicken with both hands.   What's the boy saying, Cloye?   Pa asked, crumbs of cornbread falling loose from his open mouth.   Pa, she ain't coming back. Said  ain't no use you come looking for  her. Said you'd know.   Her father's eyes groped awkwardly,  jerking about the cabin with its drafts  and cracks, its wooden floor and squat  walls. Cloye's eyes travelled with  his, wanting so desperately to see  the slender neck with its wisps of red  hair bent over the cooking stove or  turning restlessly in sleep on the  lumpy mattress. Their eyes could find  no brightness so they settled into dull  globes of misery and met again in understanding.   I don't reckon I'm too hungry, Cloye,   Pa murmured, hiding those eyes, hands  covering blackness with blackness.  Cloye looked at her father's  back hunched over the table. She  stared at the gray in his hair  which even the coal dust could  not hide. The backs of his  hands were gnarled and his face,  she knew, was creased with deep  wrinkles. She was surprised  that she had never noticed he  was old until that moment.  Sid looked up at Cloye and  he began to cry, dumplings  dropping unnoticed down his   chin onto his shirt.   I want my Mam,  he screamed.  Pa pushed himself loose from  his chair and slowly walked outside, but not before Cloye had  seen the sickness swallowing  his eyes. Her hands trembled  as she spooned a bite of dumplings into Sid's waiting mouth.   Eat your chicken, Sid,  she  crooned.  I'm going to be your  Mam from now on.    Then I got's me a Mam?   Sid asked, sobbing through a  mouthful of food.   I reckon you have,  Cloye  sighed.   Who's your Mam, Cloye?    I reckon I ain't got me a  Mam,  she answered softly while  wiping up the food at her father's  place.  We just gotta make do,   she insisted,  ain't gonna work  if we don't make do with just  what we got on hand.   Cloye felt an aching pain in  her chest as the words echoed  around the room. It was something Mam had said so often.   I ain't planning on ever  leaving you, Sid,  she whispered to the small boy.  I ain't  planning on ever leaving you.   J.C.

        <pagetext>About the  FROM South Bend  Katrina W. Johnson  THE INTERNATIONAL Women's  Year meeting, mandated by Congress  to explore women's issues, left me  and many others like me feeling  upset and indignant. What I had  anticipated to be a challenging,  interesting weekend of discussion  and exchange of ideas over problems  of women did not materialize at  all  ,  Like many women busy with job  and home, I find it convenient  not to become too involved in  broadly political groups. While  I have remained firmly in support  of women's issues, politics has  stayed entrenched in my life as  a leisure time activity   about  par with edging the lawn or  cleaning the back closet.  However, I'll talk readily  about specific issues and one  area that is significant in  both my personal life and my  career is health care. Because of IWY this concern has  broadened. Now I find myself  agitated enough to work for a  positive view of women's issues  in Indiana   a viewpoint that is  badly missing in the elected   official  delegation from  Indiana to the National IWY  meeting in Houston.  K H X  Firmly dedicated to the need to  discuss these topics, I found myself  increasingly excited about IWY. While  aware of stories of disruptions  from other states which had IWY  meetings, we heard occasional  rumors of  convention stopper   groups in Indiana. However,  we tried to plan the Health  Workshop around a fair presentation of health issues. Thus,  we decided not to discuss abortion  in the workshop because many  minds are already made up on this  emotional topic and we wanted  productive, open discussion.  I was sent some of the flyers  put out by the  stopper  groups  stating that their candidates  were  Pro-family and Pro-American.   The literature went on to urge a  NO vote on all resolutions, both  state and national. I was concerned because these groups  hadn't even heard the Health  Page 11  Workshop resolutions and they  were against them. I wondered  how a  pro  group could be  so negative and closed.  www  M W M  CONVENTION DAY was hectic, at times  narrowly close to chaos. Fifteen  hundred people had pre-registered,  but almost   ,000 showed up. The  Convention Center lobby was packed  under the Bible-waving oratory of  a few extremist preachers who condemned us all. Buses brought in  convention  stoppers  who circulated a  pink list  of so-called   Pro-American  candidates for the  national meeting.  The Health Workshop finally began with 700 rather than 300 members.  The first presentation   on teen-age  pregnancy   was also the last presentation in this workshop. The  rest of the day was a parliamentary  nightmare as  stoppers  used technicalities to stall any discussion  or further presentations.   Stoppers   voted against parenting education  and against helping pregnant women  get a high school education. The  topics of women as health consumers  were never presented. I felt  it was a great loss to the many  people who were obviously concerned  about women and health.  The rest of the meeting went  similarly. One workshop voted down  a resolution against wife abuse, with  the implication that it should be  permitted1 Violence was close when  a pink-ribboned man, a  stopper,   shoved the woman in charge of the  microphone. The general session  ended without a single workshop  resolution being passed by the  entire convention body. They voted  NO just as they were told.  M H M  MY FEELINGS about the day changed.  At first I had mostly been upset over  the problems of the Health Workshop.  The unthinking opposition of the   stoppers    no matter what the issue     had effectively ruined all presentations and discussions. As I  gathered the unused workshop materials, I began to realize that this  I. W. Y. Conference  wasn't a day that would or could be  forgotten. The IWY meeting disappointed me bitterly.   As one who  was involved in arranging a good,  balanced program with carefully  considered proposals for women's  health, I cannot believe that most  women in Indiana would not listen  to these ideas. Nutritional  labeling on food products, access  to information about drugs and  equal rights for women health  workers are some of the health resolutions that were not even heard.  Did women and men understand the  national recommendations that they  voted down? A resolution was defeated that would have encouraged  positive roles for older women and  helped them  remain in their own  homes instead of moving into institutions.  Voting shows Indiana  women as being against  humane,  sensible, and economic treatment   of female offenders. Can this be   Pro-life  or  Pro-American?  The  national resolution concerning health  allowed a review of health services  to see if they meet the needs of women,  The Indiana IWY has ended but there  are many of us who literally cannot  go home believing that this expresses  the beliefs of Indianas. There are  honest and important differences  on some issues, particularly reproductive freedom. I can accept  these differences as areas for continuing dialogue. I will not  accept the action of highly-organi  zed  stopper  groups at the meeting  as the will of the majority of  women in Indiana. Therefore, I  call upon concerned men and women in  Indiana to consider and reject  the negative and narrow stance that  has become the  official  outcome  of the meeting. Women can agree  on many positive issues. The  Indiana IWY is not over and though  the votes are counted, those of us  who are concerned will still be  heard.  FROM Indianapolis  Nancy Scott  Though I walked into the conference as  me , I walked out of  it feeling the urgent need to be part of a  we  consciousness.  Women attending the IWI conference represented all sorts of  interests and their needs and opinions varied as much as their  dress. After seeing what one well-organized anti-ERA group was  able to do in Indiana (and in other states), I now believe  we women and pro-ERA men must stand together until we have  first won our most basic and long overdue inalienable rights.  We can deal with our differences afterward.  Just call  your  neighborhood  Merchants Man  or Woman for   Green Briefcase   expertise on any  financial matter.  Merchants Bank  Devington Office  Charles L. Boggs  Assistant Vice President  Devington Shopping Center  6000 East 46th Street  267-7061  1  Ms. Johnson served as chairperson of  the IWY Health Workshop. She is the  mother of two pre-school children and  states she has a lawn that needs  edging.  Tig)  1  FROM Valparaiso  Hattie Pierce  The Women's International Year  Indiana State meeting was terrific,  but there was room for improvement  in registration. The instructions  should have been on the wall behind  the table in plain sight with better  facilities for voting.  I am sorry the Pro Life, Pro  Family, Pro God, and anti-ERA won  the election of delegates. I feel  they do not meet the qualifications of the Federal government's  funding as they do not reflect the  balance among age, race, geography,  employment and ethnic groups mandated in the federal government's  funding of the national IWY conference.

I haven't  read it cover-to-cover yet, but I'm absolutely delighted  and impressed.  It lives up to its name (which bites off a good deal).  The scope of its poetry, for example, gives us Lori French's  charming protest, then Mary Walker's quietly beautiful insight, and then the truly majestic Dolphins   so tender yet  so devastating. (It should be framed on the bulletin  board of every Fisherman's Union hall on the West Coast I  Not to mention the industry Directors' chamber )   Our Own Worst Enemies?  is so compassionately conceived,  so clearly stated, and free of rancor: the response to it  must be positive   or the worse for the responders How sad  an experience, the IWY meeting   it makes one wonder about  the reality of the Devil after all.  Austin F. Johnson Naples, Florida  We send our best wishes for the prospective newspaper  you described. Best of luck.  Liberation News Service  In solidarity, Cathy Cockrell New York, N. Y.

        <pagetext>2.  Subscribers,  If you are one of our early subscribers or if you were  one of the ones who wanted your subscription to begin  with Issue I, this note is for you.  In the beginning we thought we could be a monthly  publication.   As you know, for various reasons this was  not possible at that time, nor is it now.  So we opted for a bi-monthly, and because we promised our readers 11 issues for their money, we have  struggled to get each issue out.   Sometimes we have  not been able to make that bi- monthly schedule.  With issue 10 we are nearing our goal of the 11  issues originally agreed upon.   Although your subscription will not be up until the 11th issue is published, we are hoping you will resubscribe before  your subscription has expired.   This will save us  postage and paper work plus encourage us to continue.  Please note the price changes and the different types  of subscriptions available.  Also consider adding an extra dollar or more to be  listed on the I Believe in WOMANKIND ad.   If you  choose a supportive subscription, your name will automatically be added to the I Believe in Womankind ad  unless you advise differently.  WOMANKIND is not funded nor supported by any  particular group.   You and our advertisers make our  publication possible.   We believe in you and we hope  you continue to believe in us.

First NWSA  Convention held  by   MARY  JO   WAGNER  The National Women's Studies Association  (NWSA) held its first annual convention on May 31-  June 3 on me campus of the University of Kansas  in Lawrence.   Those of us from Indianapolis who  attended certainly returned home with renewed  energy, not only for the activities of academic  university-oriented formal women's studies programs,  but also for the broad and diverse concerns of the women's movement in general.  Twelve hundred women participated trom me  United States and around the world.   Thailand, Denmark, New Zealand, The Netherlands, England, and  The People's Republic of China were among the  countries represented.  Women operating rape crisis centers attended.  Directors of University women's studies programs  attended.   Students attended.   Non-students attended.   Black women, Indian women, Chicana  women, Lesbians, older women, radical feminists,  conservative feminists   all were in attendance.  Many of the minority groups did not have as large  a participation as could have been expected, but all  were represented.   Given this diversity of interests,  backgrounds, and personality, there were disagreements, but from a positive source.   Disagreements  from which the NWSA will grow and profit.  The activities were as varied as the participants.  Films, poetry reading, book displays, art exhibits,  concerts, feminist theatre, and caucus meetings  were intermingled with workshops.   These work  shops included everything from institutional research  to women writers, from a Lesbian Speakout to women  and success in graduate school, from child care to  rape victim support services, from sexism in foreign  language textbooks to feminist psychology.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the convention was the impossibility of attending every event  of interest.  The National Women's Studies Association, founded  in 1977, has grown to an organization of some 1, 000  feminist educators and students.   Women's Studies is  the educational  arm of the women's movement iand  its goal is educational and social equality.   The NWSA  aims to correct the historic exclusion of women from  study, research, and curriculum and its stated purpose  is:    To further the social, political, and professional  development of women's studies throughout the country,  at every educational level and in every educational setting.    The Association is already busy planning the Second  Annual Convention which will be held in Bloomington  on the campus of Indiana University in May,  1980.  Anyone interested in participating in the Bloomington  conference or desiring more information about the  Association and its activities here in Indiana should  contact Mary Jo Wagner, 1- 317-637-1931 or  1-317-633-6840.  Mayflower Classic brings the best  July 6, 7, and 8 brought the best in professional  and amateur golfers to Noblesville as the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour returned to Indiana via the  Mayflower Classic. Beautiful weather greeted the field  for the opening round of the  100, 000 event.  On Friday,  Shelley Hamlin sank a 40 foot putt on   3 and chipped in on  6 as she put together an incredible string of 6 birdies on the front nine.   I've  been working on my putting lately,   remarked Hamlin.  Jan Stephenson came on strong with birdies on  10,   13,  14,  15,  16,  and  18 to finish in a tie with  Hamlin at 4 under par.   It was  the best I've putted  all year,   Stephenson stated.    I've hit well all year,  but haven't made anything.   I've lost confidence on  the greens, but the putt at  10 helped.    Often described as  intense,   it is not uncommon  for her to practice 8 or 9 hours a day.   The reason  behind all that practice is best described by her:   Once you've won, you'll do anything to get that feeling again  The spotlight changed on Saturday.   Judy Rankin,  the 1976-77player-of-the-year, shot a 66 to finish  round 2 at 4 under par.   Hampered by back problems   Rankin, the first player to earn over  100, 000 in a  single season, one tour victory in 78, has yet to  win in '79.    There have been a lot of tournaments  this yea but I haven't gotten over the hump.   A win  would do a lot for me.   There was a point where I  just wanted to play golf again   now I'd like to win.   Sharing the Saturday spotlight was Hollis Stacy.  Stacy is best known in Indiana for winning the U. S.  Open played in Indianapolis last year.   In doing so  she became the fourth (and youngest) player to win  Hollis Stacy, winner of the 1979 Mayflower Classic,  lands the ball on the green. (Photo by K. Niles)  by BETH CORBIN  consecutive titles.   Carding a 67jStacy inched her way  closer to the leader.    I hit my driver better and the  greens held better.   I think my concentration zoomed in.  I've had a mediocre year, but I've played well the last  month.    Jerilyn Britz was the leader at the end of Saturday's  round.   Britz who has her pilot's license and flies to  and from matches as often as possible, shot 70 the  first round and 68 the second to put her at 6 under par.  A tour veteran of six years, Britz has just recently  found herself in contention, but has yet to win a tour -  nament.  First in the clubhouse on Sunday with a final score  of 3 under par was Laura Baugh. Baugh, a seven year  veteran who has yet to win a tournament, didn't think  her 3 under par would hold up. The 67 was good enough  however, and it earned Baugh a spot in her first playoff.  Out on the course the final groups had to contend  with rain.   Rankin on   18 had a chance for birdie  and an outright victory, but her put missed the cup  by inches and she had to settle for 3 under par    Britz  on  18 missed her putt for par and a chance in the playoff .   She ended the tournament at 2 under and remarked later,   it just wasn't my day to win.     Stacy  birdied  17 and tapped in a 4 foot putt on  18 to join  Baugh and Rankin at the first play-off hole, which was   16, a difficult par 4 hole.  Rankin was the first of the three players to drop out  of contention.   She missed a 12 foot putt on  16 to  take a bogey.   Both Stacey and Baugh parred  16  and continued on to  17.   At the par 3  17 Baugh  missed the green.   Stacey placed her drive safely  on the putting surface.    Dead  in the bunker with  only 6 feet of green to work with Baugh bogied.   I don't think anyone is ever satisfied unless they  win,   said a dejected Laura Baugh after losing her  closest chance at victory.  Hollis Stacy,  15, 000 richer with this win, expressed mixed emotions about the victory.    I felt  really bad for Laura,   she said.    I know how she  feels.   She's looking for her first win and it's frustrating.     This is the fourth play-off I' ve been in; the first  I've won.   I guess if you play in enough of them  you're going to win one,   said Stacy.  Stacy who almost passed this tournament up, said  she wouldn't mind paying her  100 fine for entering  late.     I decided to play here because I was borderline playing well and I needed to find that competitive edge;and Indianapolis brings out the best in me.   For second place Rankin and Baugh earned  8, 600.  Fourth place finisher Jerilyn Britz took  5, 300.   In a  four-way tie for fifth were Indianapolis native Sandra  Spuzich, Amy Alcott, Shelley Hamlin, and Barbara  Moxness.   Finishing at one-under, the four players  earned  3, 550. 00 each.   And, finishing at even par  in a tie for ninth were Jan Stephenson and Barbara  Barrow.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Women's Haven  Indy's home for battered women  by J.R.LAWRENCE  Because of the backbone and dedication of a few  strong-willed women and men, Indianapolis has a  retreat for battered and abused women and their  children.   The concept was structured by Elvira  Rodela of the Near Eastside Multi-Services Center.  Through her guidance, a board of directors was  chosen*  a budget formulated,  and legal procedures  went forth to make the Women's Haven a not-for-  profit organization.   An on-going effort, the Women's  Haven will continue to need contributions and donations.  Ms. Rodela's original idea was to rent a house,  refurbish it, and make it available for battered  women.   As plans progressed, however, a large  house became available for purchase.  Does the community need such a home?   Indeed it does,   states Ms. Rodela,   and it needs  it now.   Before the home was ready we received referrals from the police department and other organizations.   In my own situation, I receive calls for  help from women on a daily basis.   These women  have suffered physical abuse from men and have  nowhere to go.   Women's Haven plans to take referrals from many  organizations--hospitals, welfare departments, law  enforcement agencies, county prosecuting offices--  and hopes to alleviate the growing problem of abused  women in Indianapolis.   Wife abuse is a continuing cycle.   Children  watch their parents fight and usually abuse their  own spouses when they marry,    Ms. Rodela continues.    In addition, physical abuse is not all that  is involved.   Mental anguish and emotional problems  may leave scars for life.    Ms. Rodela is quick to point out that the home  will not have an  institutional-type  atmosphere.  The Stereotyped Feminist  by JUDITH RAE ROGERS  A friend of mine had a disconcerting conversation  when she went to vote in the primaries.    There was  one particular female candidate whom she felt she  wanted to support,   but she wasn't quite sure.    So  she asked some questions of a woman who was giving out campaign literature.   Does this woman support the ERA?  Is she a  feminist?,  my friend asked.   Oh, no    She's a wife and mother.   was the  woman's reply.  Despite the put-down, my friend followed her  instinct to vote for this woman and was relieved  when she later found out her candidate was, indeed,  a feminist.  Why are others so quick to assume that being a  feminist and being a wife and mother are incompatible?  How many times have you heard someone call a  strong woman a  castrating bitch,   an  aggressive  broad,   or a  bra burner?    Perhaps the most common  label is  those damned women libbers.    But the  names are not nearly as bad as the scorn, resentment,  and hostility that accompany them   How is the everyday, stereotyped feminist described .  Man-hating, children-hating, humorless,  unkept, bitchy, hostile, non-feminine, pushy, overbearing . . . ?  She is, of course, single--either because of  divorce (her fault ) or because no man would ask  her to marry him.   She burned all of her bras many  years ago, and has not shaved her legs or under her  arms for at least 7 3/4 years.   She wouldn't be  caught dead in a beauty shop,  and anyone can tell  that.   She saves money by not buying make-up or  underwear.   Naturally, she never wears skirts--only  pants.   Her house--excuse me--apartment is a cluttered , dirty mess.   She lives on packaged, easy to  fix foods when she's not at McDonald's.  Since she does not care about attracting  men,    she's grossly overweight.   Her voice is loud.   Her  vocabulary consists of four-letter words except for  an   interspersing of  male chauvinist pig,    sexist,     ER/i,   and  abortion.   This woman undoubtedly favors abortion and has  probably had a number of them. That is,  unless she's  a lesbian.   And lots of men and women will tell you  all feminists are.   They have to be.   Why else would  they want to spend time with women?  Why else  would they NOT want to stay at home where they  have it made?  Lesbian or not, married or single, the stereotyped  feminist often engages in sexual intercourse with  several different partners.   She has no conscience.  She can jump into bed with any man with no strings  attached.   In other words, she's an  easy lay.    Continued to Pg. 11  She wants it to be a comfortable, secure place-  not cold or impersonal.  Many women can often find a place of retreat  for themselves, but it is difficult--and often  dangerous--to leave offspring behind.   At Women's  Haven, children are welcome and will experience  a safe, secure atmosphere where they share a room  with their mothers.  The guidelines for staying at Women's Haven are  flexible.   To date, there are no limitations regarding the number of visits a woman can make.   Nor  is there a deadline for departure, though Ms. Rodela  expects the average stay to be from three to five  days,  which more or less depends on the woman's  particular situation.   The only request made will be  that the women not reveal the address of the shelter  to anyone.  What happens after an abused woman departs?  Ms. Rodela feels the ideal solution would be for  both husband and wife to participate in counseling.  By talking over problems and airing differences and  expectations, the woman will hopefully no longer  need the services of Women's Haven.   Of course,  she would be welcome if the need arises again.  Securing funds is one important aspect of me  Women's Haven if the goals of the retreat are to be  met and continued.   I feel funding should be a community concern,    states Kenneth Roberts,  an Indianapolis attorney and  member of the board of directors of the Women's  Haven.    Although many businessmen and women  have been receptive to the idea and also very generous,  it is the individual who counts.    He points  out that if only 50, 000 residents of Indianapolis  each contributed a dollar, the operating expenses  of the Women's Haven would be met for the first  year.    Community support will insure the success  of the shelter,   he added.    I envision a long-  range campaign to gain community recognition of  the worth of the home.   Everyone is important.    Other than monetary contributions, the shelter is  in need of a car, lawncare equipment, furniture,  bedding and baby cribs,  a washer and dryer, cook-  ware,  a television set, stoves, refrigerators, a  freezer and used clothing.   Ms. Rodela also hopes  to secure toys, books, and playground equipment  for the children.   (All donations are tax deductible.)  Volunteers, too, are needed to work with the women  in the areas of job training, educational opportunities, child guidance, establishing permanent homes,  and to staff its crisis phone lines.   Volunteers are  also needed to transport women to the shelter and  in some cases to the prosecutor's office to file  charges against the person(s) responsible.   Applicants must be at least 18 years of age and will  be carefully screened.   Women and men with some  experience in crisis intervention are especially  sought; however, those with no experience may  also apply.  Contributions, donations, volunteer service,  and information are being handled by the Near  Eastside Multi-Services Center (NEMSC), 2236  East 10th Street,  Indianapolis,  Indiana 46201.  Checks should be made payable to Women's  Haven and mailed to the attention of Elvira  Rodela at NEMSC.   Donors and volunteer applicants should call 923-2136 and ask for Lee.  Clemency denied for Jenna Kelsie   I know for sure now that there's no hope for any of us women as far as clemency is concerned. ... I have struggled harder for my freedom than anything else I have ever fought for  and it looks like it will not do me any good.   Now I am stumped. I don't know wnat to do,    said Jenna Kelsie after her petition was denied.  Jenna Kelsie is still serving 15 to 25 years at the  Indiana Women's Prison on a 2nd   degree murder  conviction for the death of her former husband who  was brutally beating her when she killed him.   That's  the reason she divorced him after suffering 4 years of  physical and emotional abuse.   When she shot him,  he was trying to bite out her eyes.  In the spring of 1978, WOMANKIND received a  poignant plea from Jenna in the form of a letter and  an article that told her story.   We printed both in  Issue VI.   Issue VII featured Jenna's story as told by  Carol Hegland, Co-ordinator of the Indianapolis  N.O. W. Prison Task Force.   Then we met Jenna     and were impressed with her warmth, sincerity,  and intelligence.   Jenna is 46 years old.   If she serves  her full term he will be almost 68 when she is finally  free.  It seemed a great injustice that this woman was in  prison, serving a term that began in November, 1976.  We were glad we had printed the two articles in  WOMANKIND.  The articles received much comment among different women and women's groups who read WOMANKIND.   Many tried to help Jenna attain clemency by  writing letters to Indiana's Governor Otis Bowen.  WOMANKIND thought we had helped by printing the  articles.   But it is evident that all our support was not  enough.   We failed Jenna.   We all failed Jenna because we believed that justice would prevail and that  everyone has a right to protect and defend her/his own  life.   We believed that the system would right its error.  We were wrong.  Jenna's petition for clemency was denied on May 29,  1979 by Governor Bowen because of  severity of the  crime  which is a standard categorical classification.  What can we do now?  Write letters especially if you intended to do some-  before and didn't.   Your letter might have made the  difference.   Make phone calls.   Remind the governor  and your congressmen and congresswomen of Jenna's  plight.   Write the Indiana Clemency Board directly.  They will help decide her fate next year.   Members  are:   Albert P. Tutsie, Chairman  John J. Barton  Ruth Pappert  Harlan Hicks  Glenn Douthitt  . All members can be written in care of:  Indiana Clemency Commission  Room 803  100 N. Senate Ave.  Indianapolis, Indiana  46204  Send Jenna a card or note of encouragement and  care.   Her address:   Jenna Kelsie    0453  The Women's Prison  410 N. Randolph Street  Indianapolis,  Indiana 46201  She needs to know we still care; we haven't forgotten.  Although Jenna is handling her disappointment well  enough under the circumstances She is under a great  deal of strain.   Her mother is ill and elderly.   It is  difficult for Jenna to comfort her.  What else can you do?  Pray.   Pray that you never have to kill to protect  yourself   for mercy  nor justice does not necessarily  prevail in Indiana   especially if you are a woman.  Issues VI and VII of WOMANKIND containing Jenna's  stories are available as back issues.  D     AMERICAN   WOMENS    SELF DEFENCE    INC.  American Women's Self-Defence, Inc. (AWSD)  teaches self-confidence, defensive living, verbal  self-defense,  and physical self defense for women.  Tne organization run by Marie Eve, has held classes in Louisville, Kentucky, Cincinnati, Ohio, Columbus and Indianapolis, Indiana.  Ms. Eve, founder of the organization, believes you can  often get a  leave me alone  message across by the tone  of your voice, if you have confidence and use common  sense.   Physical self-defense that can stop a  hand shake  that lasts too long gt;or a stranglehold  is also part of the  course.   These self-defense measures are not the mar  tial arts, but several simple methods to deter any kind  of physical harrassment.  The AWSD's complete course can be learned within  an 8 to 12 hour framework and Ms. Eve is willing to  travel throughout the country to set up these classes.  Psychological awareness, breathing exercises, meditation, self-assurance, and inner growth are part of the  course which can be attended weekly or in one day sessions.  In Indianapolis, classes will be held this fall beginning on September 17 and again October 29.   An  all day Saturday class will be held October 20.   For  further information contact the YWCA at 317-299-2750.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Lunch Hour Discussions     Patchwork Power Available for Tour  by JUDITH  RAE  ROGERS   Starting Point  is a free series of one hour  (12 - 1 P.M.) informal discussions concerning women  and careers offered by The Center for Women of IUPUI  (Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis)  The center is located at 1301 E. 38th Street.   An expert in the topic under discussion presents a short talk  while women eat their  brown bag lunches  if they  wish -  Questions and answers are heard throughout the  hour.  On Friday,  September 14 the new series begins with  a discussion of Virginia Wolfe's A Room of One's Own.  Then on October 12 the subject will be  Families-  Life Styles for the 80's     Take a Second Step  is the  title for the November 9 discussion which deals with  attending college and re-entering the work force.  These sessions are free,but space is limited so phone  in a reservation  (923-1321 extension 287).  Last spring  Office Politics,   My Mother Myself,  and the  Two Pay Check Family-What Does It Mean  to Your Pocketbook-Good or Bad?  were the topics.  I attended the  Two Pay Check Family'in March  1979 and heard Virginia Merkel,  Indianapolis Account  Executive at Thomson McKinnon make these suggestions  which I would like to share with WOMANKIND readers:  1. Save 10  of your combined gross salaries.  Separate savings accounts and separate checking accounts, along with a joint checking account for household expenses,  are encouraged.  2. Try to accumulate the equivalent of three to  six months' living expenses in case one spouse loses  his/her job.  3. Do not commit more than 20  of your salaries  to monthly bills (car,  furniture,  charge accounts, etc.),  excluding mortgage payments.  4. Get disability insurance on both marriage partners.   Carry insurance under whichever spouse's company plan is cheaper and gives you the most benefits  for your money and/or whoever has the more stable  job.   According to Merkel,  couples with two jobs  and no children may not need whole life insurance  5. Get tax free municipal bonds or tax-deferred  investments,   like annuities,.  6. Put your house in both names.   All other  purchases,  investments and gifts should be in the  name of the individual buyer, receiver,  or inheritor (to avoid inheritance tax.)  Keep detailed  records of these.   Contact expert help in planning  your estate: a Certified Public Accountant, broker,  insurance agent, and the Trust Department of your  bank.  In answer to a question, Merkel gave realistic advice in dealing with the Social Security Administration:   Do not discuss your situation on the phone.  Make an appointment with a knowledgeable person.  Get advice and /or explanations in writing  Do this  again in six months to see if you get the same information.   Return yearly    It may wise to have your own retirement plan,  especially if you are under fifty,  since you may not  be able to rely on receiving Social Security benefits  As you can see much information and many ideas  can come from attending one of these sessions.

Play   reminds  staff   member  to    write    letter  Dear Grammy Gram,  Last night I was reminded of you again and again as  I watched Womanshine Productions' moving,  adventurous play Patchwork Power.   The story takes place in  Indiana in the 1850's.   That's a little before your time,  but I imagine western Nebraska in the early 1900's  was quite similar.  1 always enjoyed hearing about your life as the only  white woman on the Indian reservation when you were  a young bride     The problems and challenges you had  were often mentioned in Patchwork Power.   What  a  strong woman you had to be to survive such a life   And to think you even enjoyed it    All of that hard  work must have added to your already considerable  character    As I watched the play, I felt like I was watching  part of your early life.   The cooking,  the housework,  the child-rearing, the quilting,  the needlework, the  sewing, the marriage preparations, the nursing of the  sick, having babies   all these were presented in  a  realistic, believable way lt;  I laughed and cried as I sat in the audience.   The  people in the play were real to me.   Their joys and  sorrows were my own    I felt a part of that family of  strong,  capable, determined women.  Nowadays people are applauding the hard work of home-  makers.   Did anyone express appreciation for your efforts back then ?  Do we have to wait sixty or seventy  years to tell you how important you were to the everyday life of all members of the family ?   Your family  would have been nothing without you.   And your importance continues to be felt.   It is felt through your  children, your grandchildren, and your great grandchildren.   Just as many loving references were made to   Greaty Gran  in Patchwork Power, our family speaks  often in the same affectionate way about our Grammy  Gram.   How fortunate we are to have your heritage.  I wish you could see this play.   One unusual aspect of  it was the sign language used by two women standing on  the stage, dressed in clothes of the mid-1800's.  Deaf  people could enjoy the play as well as those who could  hear.  I regret I do not write or call you more often.   Today  I'm writing to you to let you know that I think of you  often and that I love you.

I'm glad my  husband Stan saw Patchwork Power I'm glad my 10  year old son Michael saw Patchwork Power .    I  hope you've seen it    If you haven't,  I hope you will.  Patchwork Power.  a play written by Sharon Hatton  about pioneer Indiana women in the 1800's is a journey into all women's times.   In Patchwork Power it's  all there:   birth, death, menstruation, plus cooking,  sewing,  and even fire fighting.   There is respect,  determination, the cultivation of independence and  interdependence in a nurturing environment .   .  .  the work of saints/witches.  Judith Ann Smith as Grandma,  who at the end of  the play becomes  Greaty Gran,   put me in touch  with my own roots,  the roots of the Goddess's Tree.  I recognized the strength in my own grandmother  and mother and the serenity that comes from having  survived the big winds that howl across our minds.  Nancy Sundell, as Sarah Ann, may scream at god  the father (sic) with me any day.   Her child,  a young  woman, dies and her woman's soul must handle roaring rage.  Michelle Walderich as Becky is delightful. There's  a sparkle in the eyes of this womanchild that's as old  as woman herself.   She reminded me, of when I  became a woman.     It was a family news item then, as  surely as it was in the 1800's and is today.  Inspiring as Nancy, the daughter who died, is  Beth Mathioudakis.   Independent, confident,  capable,  she has a powerful, convincing voice with which she  delivers lines beautifully.  Tracy Jones as Cissy, the about-to-be married  daughter,  opts for fainting when pressures become too  much,or to get out of work     Cissy moves to untamed  Illinois, loses one baby, then returns to her family  home for help with the birthing.  Women are still pioneering in Indiana, and in the  world.   Sharon Hatton and the women of WomanShine are pioneers in Women's theatre,  Women's  writing,  Women's lives.   The Patchwork design is  needleworked through thickets of hate, prejudice,  and fear and  it's a good thing that there have been  some strong women raised up.   This ain't no time  for ladies.    I, for one, be thankin':  Sharon Hatton, Nancy  Sundell, Judith Ann Smith, Michelle Walderich,  Beth Mathioudakis, Tracy Jones,and all the women  and men of WomanShine Productions for the power  of the patchwork of their lives stitched together in  mis play.   Patchwork celebrates all our lives which  have too long been trivialized, stolen, and deliberately made invisible.  Patchwork Power, a play written by a modern  pioneer Indiana woman, performed by trail blazers,  pathmakers, hem stitchers, and soul-menders, is  carefully sewn together by women's minds and women's hands, to keep us warm through the winters of  injustice,  inequality, discrimination .  .  . pain   And a word of hope and/or warning to the world:   We ain't be done a sewin' change.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Typo  (With apologies to Ted Hughes, poet,  author of CROW)  God was creating woman,  but there was a typo in the knitting directions.  Crow, sitting at God's shoulder,  saw the typo  and cawed loudly to call attention to it.  But God was counting stitches and said   O Crow, stop that awful cawing.    And She just went on knitting  and got a hole in the wrong place.  by  ANITA SPEER SMITH  We are Married...

        <pagetext>6.  The  Last  Thunder shook the window and I sat up, wide-  eyed and tense, listening.   I had learned out of  necessity, to distinguish the breathing patterns of  my family.    I   listened for the long slow wheeze  of my mother and the shorter, more rapid breath  of my brother.   But I listened most carefully for  the heavy, gruff snore of my Daddy.   He was absent from the house, like many nights, this night.  Now I rested uneasy waiting.  I didn't dare sleep, not yet, not much for the  past two years.   I would nap during the day because I knew that Daddy's mood was unpredictable at night    I never felt safe until after he  was asleep, so I came to have built-in mechanisms, like a smoke alarm, which alerted me to  danger.   As time went on, these mechanisms became sensitive enough to recognize Daddy's car  coming down the street.   I had learned all the  sounds in our area, like Mr. Walker leaving his  house at eleven-thirty during the week and Mr.  Moore coming home from work at twelve midnight.   Any other car would probably be Daddy's.  As I sat in bed,  I remembered nights from the  past, like the time I heard Daddy slam his car  door hard.   He walked to the house quickly.   I  wasn't sure what to expect but his step indicated  that he was upset or even worse   mad.   He stepped  into the house and even while downstairs, he threw  a chair against the wall and a picture across the  room.   Then he stomped slowly to the steps, pausing, slowly up one step, waiting, and thumping  on another, thinking, plotting who knows what.  I slid to the bottom of my bed hiding and praying,  Oh dear God, please don't let him kill us.  Please.   Would tonight be like the past?  Would Daddy  come home and pass my door in a rational state,  going straight to his room to sleep or would he  sit downstairs quietly in the dark, for hours, planning something bizzare like the time he tried to  bash-in Mamma's head with the iron?  These  questions raced through my mind until again, in  reality, it started to happen.  I heard Daddy coming down our street.   He hit  his brakes hard enough to make the car skid.   He  walked to the front door quickly and when he shook  his keys the sound shook fear into my soul.   Then  I heard something- -a foot kicking in the door. It  hit the wall.    Goddamit Martha,   he roared,        where the hell are you?   I jumped from my bed and looked downstairs.  There Daddy stood, like a stout soldier, fiery-  eyed and red in the face.   He started to curse  and his eyes whirled towards the back of his head.  His fingers pointed and he hissed out his words  like an animal in attack.    Sweat beaded up  across his forehead.   I ran to get Mamma but she  was already beside me.    We got into my bed; she  was against the wall and I was closer to the door  and while trembling,  we held one another  Daddy started up the stairway, more powerful  with each step.   He went directly to his room  looking for Mamma,   He went to my younger  bother'r room, but Davey was alone, asleep.  He stalked through the house, room by room,  looking for Mamma and telling her,   I'm  gonna beat you 'til you're softer than pulp.    When he opened the door to my room,  the  light from the hallway flashed on my face, not  on Mamma.   Then Daddy wandered off into the  darkness of the house.   We didn't know where  but we could hear him,  in the distance bellowing,  Martha,  I'll teach you to file your taxes  alone.   I'll kill you.    WOMANKIND  NEED  HELP   WITH  YOUR  MANUSCRIPT?

She peeped out into the hallway, but  she didn't see Daddy.   She planned to go down  the steps and out the door, fleeing in only her  gown, but just as she started,  she saw Daddy and  Daddy saw her.   He had a gun.   Mamma turned  and ran back to her room.   She searched for her  gun and found it before Daddy got there.   From  my bedroom, I telephoned the police. Daddy was  mad enough to use his gun and Mamma was scared  enough to use hers.   When I got to their room,  I saw Mamma shoot once at Daddy.   The bullet  broke the mirror. She shot again, but the bullet  left only a hole in the wall.   Three bullet-like  giant sparks--be fore the gun jammed.   Daddy  stood tall and unhurt.  Mama threw her gun and started to run, but there  was  nowhere  to go.   The room closed in on her  and she found herself in a corner.   Daddy pursued  her like a hunter closing in on his prey.   He drew  back his fist and plunged it into her face.   The  force threw her body against the wall.   She cried,   Please David, please don't kill me.   Blood  mixed with tears around her mouth.   A knot, the  size of a golfball, had risen on her forehead and  because of pain, her eyes could no longer hold a  steady position.   All the space of the house was  packed into this corner and here her body collapsed  to the floor.   She was limp but I heard her whisper,   The Lord is my Shepherd.   I shall not want.   Still,  Daddy hit her hard and continuously as if there were  no God.  I ran to help Mamma.   I stepped between them,  stooped and hugged her.   She hugged me back  and sighed,   Thank God.  Daddy dropped his  gun,  turned and left the house.  The police never arrived.  I wiped Mamma's head with cold towels and  helped her walk back to bed.   The house was  quiet and my brother was still asleep.    I started  downstairs but stopped on the landing.    I sat on  the window seat with tears, long and deeply  rooted, dropping off my cheeks.    Gazing out the  window I asked if this would be the last time. No  one answered.   The rain had stopped but the *  moon was still covered with thick,  gray,  fleeting clouds.

What are your children  doing in the  classroom?   by  MARY   PARIDO  After reading  Parents: What Are Your Children  Doing In The Classroom , in Issue IX, L as a high  school teacher, felt compelled to reply.   My answer  to that question is  they're doing exactly what you  might expect them to do.   It is a strange phenomenon that we expect students  in high school NOT to reflect the values of our society  as a whole.   How are these students to truly value or  understand something (education) which our society  neither values nor understands?  In our egalitarian  stance of educating everyone, we educate very few.  Our society with its mass-media consciousness and  assembly-line technique tries to achieve a contradiction in terms: education  en masse.    It is the general attitude of our society that education is at best similar to a kind of apprenticeship, a  definite period of time expended in learning a skill  which will result in me ability to earn a living.   At  worst, tne society views the schools as a sort of holding pen for young people with whom they are either  afraid or have no time to deal.   This attitude is clearly  reflected by such statements as,  Wait until you get out  out into the REAL world,   or  Be glad you don't have  to WORK yet.     It is shown in the willingness of Americans to see real responsibility in that job at McDonald's  from four to twelve, no matter how much it cuts into  time for study.   It is obvious in the parent's own use of  time which rarely includes reading, attending lectures,  supporting the arts, or other avenues of continued education   Most crucially, we see where our values lie  when education is me area of initial and stringent tax  cuts, and those who enter the field of education are  faced with living at or near the poverty level.  At the heart of the matter is our failure to see education as an ongoing process of mental and spiritual  growth.   Our cry for relevance in the last decade completely ignored me need for revelation.   If we base our  accountability on skills for certain job classifications,  the importance of education waxes and wanes as does  the labor market.   If, on the other hand, education  takes as its task the preparation of a mind and spirit to  continue to learn and grow tnroughout life, our importance is constant.  The argument arises,  How can we measure this  task?  Interestingly enough, it can more readily  be measured in failure than in achievement.   Our  failure at this most important task may be measured  in the number of real leaders wno have emerged in  the past few decades.   It may be measured in the  attitudes of frustration and uselessness evidenced by  young people.   It may be measured in the boredom,  passivity, and non-involvement with life of adults.  In short, it is measured by the number of superficial  lives which benefit no one, least of all me people  living them.   More specifically, it is measured in  declining SAT scores and communication skills.  There are no easy answers to our situation, because  to make a real change we must grow spiritually and  intellectually as a nation.   I do have at least three  suggestions.   We must stop regarding education beyond the eighth grade as a right and deem it a privilege.   This does not mean a privilege achieved by  wealth and prestige wnich is our present system;  rather, a privilege open to those   who are willing  to work for it.   Secondly, those who care must be  willing to work where they are needed, and not  where they can make the most money.   The burden  falls most heavily on our teachers who must not only  work for lower pay, but also evidence tne kind of  spiritual and intellectual growth they want their  students to achieve.   Finally, the society must begin  to care about a  quality of life  not measured in  dollars and cents.   Those who write laws and control  the fiscal priorities must face the responsibility for  the kind of society present policy is creating.   Our  society must begin to REFLECT those values we SAY  we want for our young people and such a change will  create an environment for THE STUDENT.  M.

It's not often you hear clapping and cheering in a  movie, unless it's a Saturday afternoon matinee for  the kids.   But Norma Rae is a clapping and cheering  movie.  If it didn't appear at your neighborhood theatre  (it missed most), request that they show it.   Get a  group together.   Go see it.   You'll be glad you did.  You'll like Sally Field who plays the earthy mother  of two small children.   She is exceptional as the  warm-hearted, sexually-healthy woman who finds  dignity and friendship in her platonic relationship/  association with the union organizer played by Ron  Leibman.   Their friendship alone is one good reason  to see the movie.  Another reason is because the movie is based on  real life and real people:   Crystal Lee Jordan and  J. P. Stevens Corporation, and a factory in Roanoke  Rapids, N. C.  ''An inspiring...  authentic movie  by ROBERTA LYNCH  She is a secretary.   Her husband is a butcher.  They have been married for several years, have no  children, and work full time.   They live in a small  suburban apartment in a large metropolitan area.  And they are, in ner own words,  practically poor.    I don't mean to equate the situation of this young  couple wtio get to take annual vacations at a Michigan lake with that of a welfare mother wno can't  afford to go across town.  But there IS sometning changing in America today.  This sense of  practical  poverty is affecting a growing number of people who have long considered themselves middle income.  The secretary enumerates her May expenses.   They  are not unusual: rent, groceries, phone, a crib for a  baby that's on the way.   At the end of the list there  is no money left.   Two salaries gone.     And,   she  concludes, looking down at her feet,   this is my only  pair of shoes.   Only one pair of shoes.   That's no sign of deprivation.   But it does say something about how the pervasive promise of a consumer paradise is beginning  to come up against the bedrock reality of inflation.  It is a clash with potentially momentous implications.   More than almost any other single factor, the  American dream has been defined by the assumption  of a steadily rising standard of living.   It was a prosperity measured not just by economic indicators or  the extravagances available to the wealthy, but  most basically by the increased buying power of the  working majority.  And it really did work for some of the people,  some of the time.   First there was the home, then  the home in the nicer neighborhood, the car, the   second  car, the air conditioner, and then the  central air conditioning.  And all the while there was the promise of bigger  and better things to come.   Work a little harder,  borrow a little more, and you too can chop your cucumbers in a Cuisinart, and vacation in the Bahamas.  Although most people never get to live out the  fantasy, many working Americans find themselves  in a consumer never-never land in which they stay  forever solvent.  The young cop who gives his wife a car and a coat  for Christmas.    The steelworker who owns a motor-  boat.   The secretary who shops at Lord   Taylor.  They didn't have it made, but it's easy to see why  others felt that they'd made it.  It wasn't all an illusion, either, but it did rest on a  shaky foundation as international realities changed  and the repercussions rapidly made their way back to  the gasoline tanks of America.  Although our country's standard of living has not  significantly declined, it is no longer steadily progressing on the presumed trajectory of growing affluence that has shaped our nation's self-image.

For one thing,  they are in debt.   Outstanding consumer installment debt is now at nearly 18  of disposable income, toe highest ever.   People may be  living okay, but they are living, literally, on borrowed time.  A second and related factor is that most people  ARE living at the edge of poverty in a sense.   They  have no savings.   Thirty-seven percent of American  households have no money in the bank at all.   And  another 16  have under  500.   Unemployment is  particularly devastating in such a situation.  Moreover, people are working very hard for wnat  they have.   Auto workers, steelworkers, phone installers--they all tell the same story: everybody  works overtime; it's the only way to make it.   And  the household that once progressed on one income is  now just getting by on two: over 50  of the women  in families work outside the home today.  Finally, there is the increasing cost of the necessities of life.   New housing is fast becoming a luxury item, with the AVERAGE cost of a new home in  Chicago now topping  80, 000.   Gasoline is nearing   1.00 a gallon in many areas.   Food prices continue  to rise; beef is expected to go up 25 .  The simple fact is that many necessities now cost  more than the  luxuries.     You can probably get  yourself lined up in front of a slot machine in Vegas  a lot cheaper than you can get your kid's dental work  done these days.  This isn't a depression.   Insinuations of prosperity  still abound.   The stores are crowded with merchandise, cash registers are ringing, people are still buying.  But there is a difference.   People are more worried  more dogged by financial problems, more fearful of  the future.  From this there is a possibility that a new focus can  emerge- -one that recognizes the need to increase  taxes on corporations--or at least to get them to pay  what they already owe--rather than cutting necessary  services.   Such, a perspective is vital since it represents an opening wedge in the enormous battle to  challenge the immunity of corporate decisions from  public deliberation.  The fight against inflation can't be won as long as  it is waged against an ephemeral enemy.   The real  battle is against unchecked corporate power.   And  the real question is whether the  practically poor   will take up that fight.    In These Times    Roberta Lynch is a  national officer of the New American Movement.

        <pagetext>8.  WOMANKIND  On   The  Genealogical  Trail  DDDDDDDD  ti   d   U  p  Women as Managers  BY JUDITH RAE ROGERS   afc  by   HOPE   BARNES  For the past year, I have seriously delved into  the lives of my sixteen great-grandparents and  their ancestors.  From the start it has been an exciting adventure.  Each new discovery is like adding another piece to  a jigsaw puzzle.  I was deeply moved to read about one of my female ancestors charged with witchcraft and brought  to trial. Then I was relieved to learn she was acquitted  by a jury in Boston in 1675.  I was astonished when J. Pierpont Morgan's  name turned up in the same genealogical index as  my own.  I was interested to read about one ancestor who  built the first house in Charlestown, Massachusetts  and of another one who served on a committee to  determine the original boundary between Connecticut and Rhode Island.  But of all genealogical facts collected to date,  a prized (and I feel important) discovery concerns  women.  I had known for a long time that my great grandmother's brother, John Flavel Wright, was a publishing agent of the Methodist Book Concern at  Cincinnati during the years 1832-1844. Just recently I learned that my great uncle also published the  first woman's magazine in America.  Beginning in 1841,  THE LADIES REPOSITORY was  a pioneer in the field of feminine journalism.  A distant relative has informed me that all editions  of the magazine are in the Miami University Library  at Oxford, Ohio.  You can guess the destination of my next genealogical jaunt I  Hi  On April 24th I sent you a short article for consideration in WOMANKIND.   Since that time I  have learned additional information.   THE LADIES  REPOSITORY AND GATHERINGS OF THE WEST,  the first woman's magazine in America was published from 1841-1876.   All the editions are in the  following locations:  The Special Collections Library at  Miami University, Oxford, Ohio  Roy O. West Library at DePauw  University, Greencastle, Indiana  It is worth noting that the magazine began with  an issue of thirty-two pages and enlarged to sixty-  four pages .with a peak circulation of forty thousand  copies.  A few years after its beginning, when the nation  was being rebuilt after the War between the States,  there was a strong feeling among some in the church   against the sentimentality of the Ladies Repository,  with its sweetness and light-approach that had appealed to the sheltered second-generation daughters  of the pioneers.   Nevertheless, with some variation  in approach, it continued for thirty-five years.    Today there is a conscious gathering of scattered  and lost bits of women's materials.   For this reason  I thought you would have an interest in this additional data.  * Quote from History of American Methodism.  Vol III, Abingdon Press, 1964, page 187.  I BELIEVE IN  WOMANKIND  AND I HELPED PAY FOR  THIS AD   Rebecca Pitts  Judith Rae Rogers  If you believe in Womankind, send  1 or more  and we will include your name in our next  issue's I BELIEVE IN WOMANKIND ad.  WOMANKIND  P.O. BOX 16306  INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA  46216   When the accountants realize their auditor is  a woman, they show resistance. However, they  readily accept me when I make return trips.    It's frustrating to spend time doing my boss's  job in order to cover for him.     How do you tell your supervisor that s/he is not  doing a good job?    Is it possible for a skillful technician to become  a good manager?    How often do you see a woman take work time  to go to the beauty shop?  Or to play golf?   Yet a  man often does.   It's not fair     It upsets my mother that I travel with men. She  won't come out and say so, but I can feel her disapproval .   These comments and questions were voiced at  Batten, Batten, Hudson   Swab's Management Seminar for Women held at the Marriott Inn in Indianapolis on July 10-12, 1979.   Topics covered included  management skills, assertiveness training, performance appraisal, motivation, communication,  delegation, constructive criticism, time manage-  ment,and resolving conflict.  The original purpose of the seminar was to quickly train recently promoted women in management  skills.   Although it is not a structured part of the  workshop, special problems of WOMEN in management are often brought up by participants.  Seminar leader, June Taylor, encouraged the  women to raise questions and enter into discussion.  She willingly shared personal experiences with the  class and it was obvious that she enjoys her job.  Her use of numerous teaching methods - lectures,  questions, small group discussion, movie presentations, etc. added variety to the all day sessions.  Taylor told her students:  There's nothing wrong  with making a mistake unless you continually make  the same one. We learn from our mistakes. After  we analyze and evaluate a mistake, we can turn it  around into a positive thing so that it may become  a strength.   Five myths about women were presented and  negated:  1.  Pin-money myth  - Forty-nine per cent of  women who work outside the home are the SOLE  support of their family.  2.  Here today, gone tomorrow myth  - The  retention rate for men and women is about the  same.  3.  Absenteeism is so high - - you can't depend  on them myth  - Here again, the rate is about the  same for men and women.  4.  Barefoot and pregnant myth  - Only five per  cent of professional women who have babies do NOT  return to their job.

Men and women are not alike  myth- In a standard study, when given aptitude tests covering twenty-  two areas, men and women scored about the same on  fourteen. Men excelled the women in two; women surpassed the men in six.  June Taylor recommends a full course in  assertiveness training for everyone:  Taking  assertiveness training was one of the most valuable  things to me in my professional life and in my  family life.     Building self-confidence is a skill we can work  on,   states Taylor.   She encouraged us to write  out our strengths on a card and tape it to the bathroom mirror.   Every morning and night we should  read the list aloud:    I am enthusiastic.   I can make  decisions quickly.   I am ...   I can ...   Joe  Batten (author of TOUGH-MINDED MANAGEMENT) suggested that you look for a new strength  each week.   Write it down.   Use that strength.   If  one week you find you have two new strengths,  save one of them for a week when you can't find  one so easily.   In a year, you will have fifty-two  new strengths.  June Taylor feels there are three types of men.  The first is the male chauvinist who will never  change.   He will never accept women in management.    Arguing with him will turn him even more  against women.  The second kind of man feels threatened by women.   Because he lacks self-esteem, it is important  for a woman to be supportive of him. If she can  point out to him his positive characteristics, he will  gradually become less fearful of her taking over his  job.  The third class of male accepts women because  he feels good about himself. His good self-image  gives him self-confidence.  The nine women who attended the seminar benefited in numerous ways.   We learned not only from  the leader, the movies, and the information presented, but also from each other.   We shared  personal experiences openly and honestly.   We  took risks revealing ourselves and found it worthwhile.  According to Taylor, a new seminar is being  designed for probably the end of 1979.   It wiU  focus more on particular problems of women in  management.  For information on this and other seminars, write  Batten, Batten, Hudson and Swab, 820 Keo Way,  Des Moines,  Iowa  50309.  Feminist   writer  released  TING LING, China's outstanding feminist and most  famous woman writer who was  purged  in 1957 was  released 21 years later in 1978.   Declared  rehabila-  tated , Ting is now living in Shensi Province with her  family.   During her  disgrace , she was believed to  have been sentenced to work as charwoman for the  Writers' Union of which she had once been an honored  member.  One of Communist China's top writers, Ting Ling  was awarded the Stalin Prize for her novel,  Sun  Shines Over the Sankan River    in 1952.   Her open  writing about women's sexuality and feelings were  part of her downfall.

WOMEN in DISTRIBUTION, the only National  women's book distributors, have gone out of  business.   They simply could not handle the financial  crunch any longer.   It takes money to make money, and  as usual   women generally do not have much cash.  It will be extremely difficult for feminist bookstores  across the nation to procure feminist literature without  the aid of Women in Distribution.  Support feminist businesses.

One day in erly life thear was a  cabin in some woods and the peopole  who lived thear where poinears.   it  was getting prity dark and soon it was  time to go to bed  the children went  up stars to the loft and went to sleep  Mother and father went to bed down  stars  sedenly a Inden came to the  cabin and broke the door down,   the  children wernt afraide becau father  was strong enef to match an Inden  bet they dint stay  they wen't to the  cellar and hinounder the cornhusks  the Inden went around he had to get  the candel he found a cradle and a  quilt and a piece of venison he ate  the venison he was standing on the  trapdoor  the trapdoor gave away  the Inden fell to the cellar  father,  tided a rope around him and the  Inden dint spek and then the Squaw  arid a brave came to the cabin the  Squaw had a papoose  the brave  fell to the cellar there was a nother  rope  father tide the other Inden to  the chair and the squaw took the  knife and kelled father and Mother  and the children got away,   the End.  Now, after reading the above, you'll have to  admit that the kid has imagination, but also a  spelling problem.  Another paper from the same kid, written as  punishment for talking in school: (He was to list  good reasons for not talking in school.)  1. because you are not posed to  2. if evbody talks it would disturb other  clases  3. dont talk when the techer is  4. if you talk you can get in truble  5. when you talk and others talk it sounds  like that you dont care about school  7. if you talk and techer doesn't stop you  you wold miss your lesen.  8. you cant here the techer.

The other day I asked him  what he will do later in life if he can't spell.   I can just dictate to my secretary and let her  worry about it or if I'm a writer, (God forbid)... I  can blame it on the typesetter, like you do, Mom.    It was then I noticed the cover of his notebook.  He had written under his name  I am grate ...  ( grate  was underlined twenty times.)

At Eagle Creek Park in Indianapolis,  it was Jane's  job to make sure the park and its visitors were safe and  abiding by the park's rules and regulations. Not an easy  job to do for in Indiana,  the city parks department  rangers do not have any arresting powers. They must  rely on County Deputies for that function.  cdfl  Dawn breaks on another July the Fourth.   A  sickening wakefulness enters my brain    I try to  hide beneath my pillow, but to no avail.   I have  to go to work.  With the help of some fancy Grand Prix driving,  I avoid the big tulip tree on Dead Man's curve.   I  slide into my parking place, not a minute too early,  nor a minute too late     The fat squirrel sitting in the  bird feeder sneers at me as I fumble with my keys.  (I hear the radio)    KJK 585 Indianapolis Indiana  Department of Parks.   Time: 8:02.     My reply---   915.   10-41.  (I'm '915')  The Chevy pickup turns over easily in the humid  morning air.   Above the rumbling of the engine, I  already hear the incessant popping of firecrackers.  I decide to see if the gatehouse needs anything.  I'm sweating pretty well by now and I can tell  it'll be another hundred-degree day.   As I pass Eagle Beach Drive, I catch a glimpse in my rear view  mirror of a red Pontiac with some strange object  lashed to the roof.   Since it's too small to be a  dead moose, I conclude it must be a  hot  picnic  table.   922 to 915.   (The gate wants me.)   915.    Can you Signal 8 immediately?  (This means  'meet at gate'.)   Is this an emergency?    Negative.     I'll be there as soon as I can.   While I'm turning the truck around, I notice an  elderly couple waving frantically at me from their  station wagon.   Where can we get something to eat?    When does the swimming pool open?    Do you know where the O'Briens are camped?   With three quick answers,   Here. 10. 4.  and  the gift of a park map,   I'm free to pursue the table  nappers.  Five curves later I'm down the straight-a-way.  No red Pontiac in sight.   How could I lose some -  thing that big?   To my right I distinctly hear,   Takin' Care of Business     Could it really be---   Bachm an- Turner Overdrive - Live - at-Eagle - Creek  Park?   Would you believe a pink custom van  with Darth Vader's portrait on the side?   Yes, and  it's parked beneath the shade of an old Cherry tree  in the middle of picnic site five.   Sir?   I'd like to inform you of one of the rules  we have at the park.   It's illegal to take your van  off the road.   We've provided a parking lot over  there.     I paid my dollar-an-a-quarter.   I can park  wherever I want    Oust my luck, a gorilla with bad breath.)   Well, there's a place not far up the road where  you can park in lots more shade, all nice and legal.  I can show it to you.   This picnic ground gets too  hot and crowded anyway.    ...Okay, man.   That sounds alright.   Hey, you  wanna beer?   (I need one, but I decline the offer.)   922 to 915.     915.    I have a report of a riot at Shelter B.     10-4. Anymore information?    Negative.     10-4.   It's only 9:30 and the natives are restless.   I  barely step out of the truck before I'm deluged  with two sides of a bitter argument.   Hiding behind my shelter reservation sheet, I discover neither party has reservations.   So I kindly direct  them to picnic areas at opposite ends of the park.  It's time for a high-level strategy meeting and  pep talk at the Ranger Station about holiday traffic control.   Nervous with pre-game tension, we  prepare our defenses:   tacky cardboard signs,middy traffic cones, awkward sawhorses, and a quart  of Pepsi.   My assignment is (should I choose to  accept it) directing traffic at the Beach Road  and  main parkway intersection.  There's still time for a little fresh air and foot  patrol at Lilly Lake.   As soon as I arrive, a fat  teenager on a skateboard  hangs ten  down the  asphalt path to the paddleboat dock.   Deftly missing three toddlers, a poodle, and a trash barrel, he  disappears into the crowd while his skateboard careens into the lake.  On the opposite shore, with the intensity of  World Series pitchers, three rock throwing kids  are attempting to sink a flock of geese.   Simultaneously the silence is shattered by a droning  like a giant insect.   It's Evil Kneival practicing  his  famous  wrong-way-on-a-one-way-street  trick.   Praying for a S. W. A. T. team, I report  him on my walkie talkie.  I feel a tell-tale grumble in the pit of my  stomach   (lunchtime), but my watch reminds  me I have only thirty minutes till I'm due to  direct traffic.   I'll have a hot dog, potato chips, and a Sprite   The potato chips are broken and the Sprite is warm.  But things could be worse.   At least I'm getting some  food.   Or am I?    Independence Day is a time of celebration, but  here it seems everyone is only celebrating their privilege to drive an automobile.    It's early afternoon  and I have to deny them this right of celebration.  The beach parking lots are filled to capacity.   I'm sorry sir, there are no more parking spaces  left at the beach.   There's a parking lot up the road  on your left you can use, though.     But my brother's down there.   He's got a place  for us.     There are no parking places.   I can't let you go  down there.     Leave me alone or it'll be the last thing you ever  ever do    I pretend that I'm directing the landing of planes  on an aircraft carrier with some clever signals from '  my orange traffic flags.   This artistry goes completely  unnoticed however, by the driver of a silver Cadillac.  Apparently she also ignores the brake lights of the car  in front of her,  and the two bumpers meet in sweet  embrace.   915 to Eagle Creek Sheriffs.   H-E-L-P    My anti-perspirant doesn't work; I have ring a-  round the collar; my shoe  odor-eaters  are eating themselves; and the skin is peeling off my nose.  It's time for me to go home, but it appears as if I'm  the only one in the park with that idea.   My conscience won't let me leave yet.   So I bandage a  knee, catch a runaway collie, pick up some trash,  talk to some hikers, and finally nod back to the  Ranger Station.  The damp night air swallows me in my thoughts  as I pass the park gates on my way home.   There's  only one thing about today that I don't understand      whatever happened to that red Pontiac with  the stolen picnic table?

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  Remarkable Retiree: Winona Graham  BY  RICKI F. POLLACK  Ask Winona Graham about her life as a teacher  and she will respond,   I was very fortunate; I  always seemed to be in the right place at the right  time.   *When I first started teaching pre-school, I did  not yet have my Bachelor's degree.   I taught preschool in 1948, finished the work for my degree in  1954,and went on for my Master's.in 1956.    After teaching in the Englewood,  Colorado cooperative pre-school program, she heard about a  position with Head Start.   Thinking it was a volunteer position, she took some additional training and  became totally involved with the Head Start program.  Later, she trained Head Start teachers.   Head Start was one of the most stimulating, exhilarating experiences in my life.   We were doing  something that had not been done before and we had  great confidence that we were on the right track in  our teaching.   Head Start was the kind of program  that could excite an entire nation to do something  and do it quickly and well for the children's sake.    In 1969 she joined the faculty at Metropolitan  State College  in Denver where she taught Early  Childhood Education.    Sometimes my students  thought I talked too much about Head Start, but I  didn't blame them.   I felt it couldn't be emphasi2ed  enough.   I also felt it was a vital and important part  of any Early Childhood Education program.   Most  of my students found it inspiring in their later work  with young children.    She retired as Professor Emeritus in 1976.   She  says,  Many people feel that when they retire, they  would like to do something completely different.  I've heard teachers say they would never want to step  back into the classroom again, but I don't see anything else with as much appeal for me.    So what is she doing now that she has  retired?   Winona Graham does consulting work for pre-school  programs around the state and she has joined a ballroom dancing program ( it keeps me moving and in  touch with young people ).   Also, she has begun work  on her doctorate.   When people ask why, she replies,   I may have achieved beyond my understanding in  my lifetime of teaching and now 1 need to consolidate what I know and what I have experienced and  see if it all fits together.   Getting my Ph. D will be  putting all my teaching, all my learning into  perspective, unlike most people who acquire a  doctorate as a sort of pinnacle of their profession.    She is writing a history of Early Childhood Education  (ECE) in Colorado to show how children have been  educated over the past hundred years and what direction ECE might take in the future.   To do this she  needs help.    I felt the best way to gain access to a  community of scholars was to go back to school.    New Publication on Disabled Women  What Happens After School? A Study of Disabled  Women and Education has been released by the  Women's Educational Equity Communications Network (WEECN).  Six disabled women with diverse backgrounds  share their experiences with the educational system,  with work,  and with relationships.   In addition to  these interviews,  the booklet includes 18 photographs; a resource list of publications and organizations; guidelines for the representation of exceptional  persons in educational materials; and a summary of  the laws related to education and the disabled.  The authors are CeCe Weeks and J. Corbett  O'Toole.   CeCe Weeks is Coordinator of the Welfare  Advocacy Unit at the Center for Independent Living  in Berkeley, California.   She is completing her  master's degree in feminist therapy from Antioch  College West.   J.  Corbett O'Toole is a feminist  and long-time advocate for disabled women.   Disabled herself since infancy, she works as a Training  Specialist with the KIDS Project at the Center for  Independent Living and trains elementary school  teachers and children to prepare them for the integration of disabled children into the regular classrooms.  What Happens After School? A Study of Disabled  Women and Education is available for  3. 50  (prepaid) from WEECN, Far West Laboratory,  1855 Folsom Street, San Francisco, Ca., 94103  All my life, I have had something interesting to do, says Winona Graham. (Photo compliments of Colorado Woman.)  Studying for her advanced degree at Pacific Oaks  and The Fielding Institute in California, her major  work will be done in her home community in Denver.  She travels between the two places.   Her main project  for her new degree is the book about Early Childhood  Education.  Winona says,  As teachers we always have an  audience, which can give us a false sense of our  abilities.   Now, as a student, I am the learner --  the one asking questions.    She finds that is almost  unbelievable  for someone like myself who has  always had an opinion about everything     It is  certainly an enormous challenge.    It doesn't relate to any of my previous roles as wife, mother,  grandmother, or teacher,   she laughs.  Winona might have remained on her  little  pinnacle  as she puts it.   Her life had been full  and rich and she had always given much to others,  but her need to change and grow and not settle  into retirement generates excitement in her and in  everyone who knows her.   All my life, I have had something interesting  I have wanted to do, and now is the time to do it,    says Winona Graham.

I am incarcerated in the Indianapolis Women's Prison for  murder.   I did not do anything wrong, besides defend myself and my daughter a-  gainst  the attack of my husband.  He was not living with me at the time.  I had filed for divorce and had a restraining order on him.   But he broke into my  home and I shot and killed him.  Now the state has convicted me of mur -  der.  Several of my rights were violated, and  the state withheld evidence.  I suppose you get several letters from inmates claiming innocence, but I assure you  I had no wrong doing in mis tragic mess.  I  have no idea why it was blown out of proportion and the Grand Jury misled into an  indictment.   But somewhere, somehow,  someone has to help me.    I can not conceive of imprisonment for forty years when  I only did what an animal would do     protect its offspring.  If you can possibly help and care to hear  more, please come out or write me a letter.  The cry of injustice shall ring from me  for eternity, if I do have to take this. But  I shall never stop trying.  Thank you for listening.  Geraldine Morse   -0771  Indianapolis,  IN.  Crusader   spreads    word...  As a crusader, it has always seemed important to  me to try to influence others (especially women I  care about) to be feminists.   After many emotional  agruments,  I found the soft approach is more effective.  After people get to know me, they are often more receptive to my ideas of the women's movement simply  because they respect me.  Now I've thought of a new way to  spread the word      especially to young people.   I have decided to send  WOMANKIND subscriptions to friends and relatives for  birthdays,  graduation presents, Christmas presents--  WHENEVER I would normally go to a store and purchase  a present.  This year subscriptions; next year WOMANKIND  postcards.  Please send 9 subscriptions and also put me on the I  Believe in WOMANKIND ad.  Sincerely,  Judith Rae Rogers  Indianapolis,  IN.  Ms. Rogers is now a member of the WOMANKIND  staff serving as a writer/reporter and proof reader.  Women  should run Postal   Service  Thank you for your warm response to my impatience  regarding WOMANKIND.    I still have not received my  issue, but will give it another day or so before I return  the WOMANKIND postcard as signal of distress with  the U.S. Mail system   I have been discouraged several times since my  move to New York about first class mail not being  received; if that is the case, I wonder very much  about third class.  I think it might one day be a good idea to get together with a group of women and devise a plan for  the U.S. Postal Service.   I am convinced that we  could work it out much better than it has been worked  out in the past; perhaps it is time for us to stop complaining and take some action.  I have been thinking about several pieces for magazine (or possibly a book later on) about growing older in America today (for women).   I am also working  on a book with a photographer friend regarding older  women.   I have a great many thoughts about the  process in general and women in particular.  Does each issue have a specific subject?   What are  some of the ones you have covered at this time ?  Are older issues available; let me know and I'll  send a check for them.  Even without having received my first issue at this  time, I have very good feelings about what you are  doing and if there is something you would like for  me to do or think about     this is an offer in good  faith and . . . and  Sisterhood  Ricki Pollack  New York, N.Y.  Update: Ms. Pollack is receiving WOMANKIND and  has an article on this page.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Stereotyped Feminist Continued from Pg. 3  Does any of this sound familiar?  It all seems  rather ridiculous when all of her stereotyped characteristics are put together, doesn't it?  More likely,  the  women's lib haters  have in mind only a few  of these qualities at a time, which gives more  credence to their perpetuated view of a feminist.  What will it take to demonstrate to others what a  feminist truly is?  Should we take a survey among  Womankind's readers and see who shaves her legs,  how many will laugh at an occasional sexist joke,  and who wears a bra (    ) sometimes, (    ) during  the week, ( ) always, (    ) never, (  Tonce a  month, ( ) only when jogging?  SucTTa study might  be interesting to Womankind readers, but it would  probably not change anyone's attitude.  I used to do a lot of screaming and yelling when  conversing with male chauvinists and  total women.    It merely increased my own frustration.   I do not  advise that approach.  Deleting stereotyped  feminist  behavior from  commercials,  television programs,  movies,  and  fiction would probably be influential--after a  long time.   But you know how impatient we  feminists are   I wonder if the answer isn't within ourselves?  Perhaps we who are feminists need to affirm our  beliefs more.   I don't mean we should wear the  label feminist as a chip on our shoulders or wave  banners.   But let's be proud of being feminists and  not hide the fact.   When others see that all kinds  of women    - including women who wear underwear,  who go to the beauty parlor when they can afford  to, who are affectionate parents, who like MEN  and WOMEN, are also feminists   with feminist,  beliefs, they will begin to question those stereotyped qualities which they have labeled incorrectly.  017) 299-2276  jilfa /fjra/i/iicz  FULL SERVICE PRINTING  631 t.

I enjoyed the book review by Judith Rae Rogers on  The Women's Room   in a recent issue of WOMANKIND.  I agree with her premise that  the novel constantly  forces the reader to delve into unconscious feelings .  That is why it has made such an impact on women.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  ERA March in Chicago      Women - Yesterday and Today  The E.R. A. March will be held in Chicago on  Saturday, May 10, 1980.   Plan to be there.   All  women are invited to participate.   It's important.  In 1979, the ERA lost by only two votes in Illinois.  This march is to support the ERA and urge its  passage by the Elinois legislature.  Marchers are asked to wear white, which has  become the symbol of the ERA marches since the  Alice Paul March on August 26, 1977 in Washington,  D. C. This concept dates back to the demonstrations  conducted by the suffragists who marched for the vote.  Don't be left out.   Organize your area to turn out  for the march in Chicago.  Marchers will assemble on Columbus Drive between  Monroe and Jackson streets at one end of Grant Park  until the march step-off, which is scheduled for  11 a.m.   The marchers will follow a route down  Columbus Drive to the rally site, . 8 of a mile away.  There they will rally and hear music and speeches.  The weather is expected to be pleasant but a bit  windy on the lakeshore.  For details consult a local N.O. W. chapter or  write to National N.O. W. headquarters, Suite  1048, 425  13th Street, N. W. Washington,  D.C.   20004.  In Indianapolis:  If you are in need of a ride or would  like to make carpool arrangements to Chicago, call  J. R. Lawrence (9-4 daily) at 846-4799.  Marchers are urged to stay in Chicago through  Sunday for a National ERA Leaflet Day which will be  held in shopping centers in the Chicago area.  On Monday, May 12, after an ERA Support Day  in the Chicago downtown Loop area, supporters  plan to journey to Springfield, Elinois for a National  ERA Lobby Day.

C. Starker  Josie Lawrence  Judith Rae Rogers  Martha Esther Eubanks  Aunt Rae Brengle  Pat Watson  Tracy Farrell  A hundred years ago, in the United States, a so  called Christian country, all wages earned by awot  man were turned over to her husband.   Children belonged to the husband.   A wife could be divorced by  the husband, but not the husband by a wife.   If a  woman was a spinster, she had to have a male  guardian of her property.   No woman could sue for  breach of promise or contract, or receive damages  for injury to her person or character.   A husband  could give children away without his wife's consent,  although he proved to be a degenerate or a drunkard.  A man could beat his wife, his child, his dog, and  nothing was done about it.   That hasn't changed  much today.   We still have the bruised child and  the battered wife.   The humane society takes care  of the dog.   Thank God for one change.  Why all this? Because men believed that women  were not capable mentally to handle any problem.  On July 19, 1848, the first convention of women  was held at Seneca Falls, New York to discuss social  civil and religious conditions of rights of women.  At the Seneca Falls Convention, women were  called  atheists, hermaphrodites, and hyenas in  petticoats .   We have come a long way from those  days.   Thanks to women   Elizabeth Cady Stanton was one of the speakers  at the Seneca Falls Convention.   She was rebuked  by a married clergyman who said,  The Apostle  Paul recommends silence to women.   Why don't you  mind him?  Mrs. Stanton quickly retorted,  The  Apostle Paul recommends that clergymen do not  marry.   Why don't YOU mind him?   Susan B. Anthony, women's suffrage leader, who  attended the meeting at Seneca Falls, saw the conditions around her: women who worked entire days  in factories for 12 cents, then had to turn it over to  their husbands.  Susan's own father was the owner of a factory  and he tried to pay his women a fair wage, but  there was still so much to be done.   She and two  friends made speeches all over the country.  We can't all be leaders today and get our names  in books, but we as individuals can have the faith  and the courage of our convictions, by working as  a unified society in politics, economics, family and  the church.    We are making history today.   As a  group of 4 million women, we are improving the  Status of women all over the world.   But there is  still much to be done.

The potential voting  power of women is greater than men's.   There are  more of us.  Since this is true, we women are not accepting  our full responsibility at the polls.   Every good progressive-minded woman should desire good government and should be willing to promote it.   Some  say  Politics is dirty, we don't want to mix in it  or   All politicians are rotten .   Those politicians  were elected by good people who DIDN'T vote.  Think of that when you say  What's the use of  voting  and stay home from the polls.  To make our votes count, women must learn to use  group power.   This is important in the primary, where  generally only one third of the votes are cast compared  to the general election .     Thus, votes have triple  weight in a primary.  We may not as a small group influence Washington,  but we can have a great deal to say at home.  We are asking for an Amendment to the Constitution for Equal Rights for Women.   You say we have  that already.   That was woman's suffrage.   We have  it in theory, but not in practice.   There are still  thousands of laws that discriminate and set women  apart from men.  Remember, we hold in our hands the voting  power (51 ).   Are we going to waste it or use it?  That's for you to decide.   You'll agree the world  is in a mess today.   By us complacently sitting at  home minding our own business and affairs, does  that make us blameless?  No   In the past you voted as your grandfather or father  did.   We say now, vote for the issue.   Vote for those  who are pro-ERA.  Some say if this amendment is passed, women  will have more responsibilities.   The modem woman wants to have a full and equal share of troubles  and benefits, of problems and laughter.   She doesn't  want to be either a slave or sit on a pedestal.   I  have enough faith in my sex to believe women can  do their share.  What can we do in Economics?

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND   An Afternoon with Nikki Giovanni   by  MARY PARIDO   If I could choose any weapon,  I would choose words.    The poet Nikki Giovanni chose her weapon on  February 17 in Indianapolis, and within the range of  her fire lay every established prejudice and useless  convention of the decade.   Presented by the Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library Board, Ms.  Giovanni spoke to a standing-room-only crowd in the  St. Peter Claver Cultural Center which has a seating  capacity of 1, 000. Her appearance was one event in  a series celebrating Black History Month.  Her dress and stature belying her force, Ms.  Giovanni held the crowd spellbound.   Her lecture  was punctuated by laughter, applause, and cries of  agreement as she moved in aphoristic cadence from  topic to topic.   It was particularly gratifying to see  such response to a female poet who, while entertaining, never allowed the crowd to forget the serious intent of her words.  Her purpose for the afternoon was to reaffirm her  pride in her race and sex and to plead with others to  look at the contemporary issues.    There is a new  idea of what it means to be alive,   she argued.   It  no longer suffices to support the ideas handed down;   Everything must filter through your own brain.    One of the issues she confronted was the complacency  regarding civil rights.   Seeing the 196O's as the high  point of the century, she pointed out that equality with  regard to race is still more ideal than real.   She supported  her point with a comment regarding the Olympics, remarking that the Winter Olympics with predominantly  white participants was never in danger.   Rather, the  boycott falls on the Summer Olympics where more  black athletes are affected.   She reminded the crowd  of the outcry in 1968 when black athletes raised the  fist as a show of power.   The word then was that the  Olympics are not an arena for political action.  The energy crisis received two salvos from Ms.  Giovanni.   She argued that it was  audacious to burn  food for fuel in a hungry world.      Referring to nuclear power she pointed to the absurdity of fearing  nuclear war, if we can't protect ourselves from Three  Mile Island.   If mankind does not stand for the best  of the species, how can we justify ourselves?   As a solution to some of the problems frustrating the  nation, she seeks an emphasis on those qualities which  she considers unique to humankind: emotion, utilization of intelligence, and a refusal to hurt.  Following her somewhat long and pointed political  exhortation, she graced the audience with an expression  of the unique humanity in her poetry.   Reading from her  several volumes (MY HOUSE, Morrow, 1972; EGO  Writers' retreat in Vermont  A Farming/Writing Retreat for Writers Working on  Major Projects is being sponsored by the International  Women's Writing Guild, June 22 - 27, 1980, at  Shelbourne Farms, Vermont.  Shelbourne Farms is a 1, 700 acre estate and working farm 10 miles south of Burlington, Vermont.

I Started My Own  Business At Home  Nikki Giovanni gathers her thoughts before speaking  to Indianapolis audience.   (Photo by J, LaFourest)  TRIPPING and OTHER POEMS for YOUNG READERS.  Lawrence Hill, 1973;  THE WOMEN and THE MEN,  Morrow, 1975; and COTTON CANDY ON A RAINY DAY,  Morrow, 1978) she aimed her marvelous weapon at the  heart as well as the head.   It is in her poetry that Ms.  Giovanni achieves a universality and depth of emotion  that turns the listener toward the inner self where growth  and change commence.  The only negative aspect of the afternoon was the  separation this writer felt due to color/race during the  political remarks.   Admittedly a black chauvinist, Ms.  Giovanni leveled several volleys at the white race, of  which there were about 25 in the audience.   Realizing  the purpose of her appearance, these remarks are perhaps understandable and probably justified; yet,  this  writer felt a distancing from the poet never experienced  through her poetry.  Women, who have always recognized where true  nobility lies and have suffered indignity because of  their sex, are the best hope for a real human community.  It is imperative that they, unlike the male of the  species, draw together and surmount the false distinctions so long maintained by both races.

The kids are  all in school, and I just don't have enough to keep me  busy.   Face it.   A person can only do so much housework  in one day    I agreed. Having grown accustomed to the hustle and  bustle of a business office for nearly a decade, I had been  having my own struggle identifying with a new life style.  I was surprised to discover how quickly the novelty of freedom and leisure time could wear off and turn into time  spent unproductively.  Later that week I was reading a magazine for writer's.  I found that people were advertising their services in  the field of manuscript typing as a service to authors.   I can do that,   I thought. There was much to consider:   Will I need a permit?  By purchasing in large  quantities, can I get supplies at a discount?  Where  should I advertise?  How much will it cost to advertise  in a national magazine, the campus newspaper, the  local newspaper?  What should I charge?  Should the  business have a name?   What about record keeping and  a separate checking account?  Excited at the prospect of being able to operate a  business out of my home, I immediately wrote letters  requesting advertising rates from two national magazines.  Because I live within the city limits, I found I had to  apply for a special variance (due to zoning regulations)  to operate a business from my home.   When I visited City  Hall to pick up the application form, I was handed a large  stack of printed material.   At first, I considered forgetting  the whole thing, but by now the business was in my blood  and I decided to see it through.   I completed form after  form and gathered all the necessary information, including drawing a sketch of the floor plan of the house  and obtaining the legal description of oar property.  Then, I made a telephone survey of the local office  supply houses to get an idea of the best rates for quality bond paper and other supplies.  My next decision was whether 1 should name the  business.   In weighing the pros and cons, 1 called some  of the telephone numbers listed under typing services in  the campus newspaper without a business name.    After  calling the first few numbers, it was apparent that these  home businesses were wasting money advertising.   Most  freely admitted their low income scarcely paid for their  ads and supplies.   After calling the services listed with  a business name and learning they were receiving enough  large-scale jobs to pay their expenses as well as making  a handsome profit, the decision was obvious.   The  business would have a name and would offer a professional service under a professional name  while  practicing proper business ethics.  A call to the IRS convinced me to keep accounting  records of every dollar of income and expense so it  could be accurately reported for income taxes.   A  two-column journal headed  Income .and  Expenses   would suffice.   To aid with the recordkeeping, a  separate checking account was set up under the  business name.  Never having done contract work before, I did not  know what to charge.   Considering the expenses, I  calculated the cost of materials, depreciation on the  typewriter, and an hourly labor charge.   I arrived at a  rate competitive with the services established in outside offices.  The decision about advertising would make or break  the business.    There were two local newspapers from  which to choose; the daily newspaper received by most  city residents and the campus newspaper distributed to  University students, faculty, and staff.   To determine  which would get better results   I placed a one-week  ad in each newspaper.   During that week, approximately 96  of the calls I received represented the  campus newspaper.   From then on I advertised in the  campus newspaper.   Finding the rates in a national  magazine, I placed a 6-line ad to appear for six  consecutive months.  By the time the business was two months old, I was  scheduled two to three weeks in advance.   At some  particularly busy times, I was forced either to turn  work away or to hire a part-time assistant.   I chose the  latter.   Soon the business grew to require two part-time  typists.   (These women worked out of their homes and  were paid on a sub-contract basis.)  The business is nearly a year old now and produces as  much work as I can handle.   As well as university orient-  continued to page 4

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  4.  Women      continued from page 2  widows, young and old; divorced women; women  who never married; women with aged parents to  support and husbands who do not make enough to  live on.   It is necessary for women to work in our  national economy.  Women also spend 85  of our nation's income, but  as long as we do not have an equal pay, unscrupulous  employers will continue to hire women at lower  wages than men.  There are traditions we must change.   It is not the  woman's job alone to raise the children.   The husband must take his full responsibility.   Just because  he is at work 8 hours a day, does not excuse him the  other 16 hours.   I do not think that because a mother  works, it makes her a delinquent parent.  The next time a woman is criticized about her  children, ask what was her husband doing?  We criticize women for drinking.   I know of a woman  who goes with her husband, although she doesn't care  for liquor, and drinks cocktails with him because she  wants to make a success of her marriage.   Who do you  think is to blame in this situation?  We've come a long way since Martin Luther said   his wife should remain at home, keep house, and  bear children .  Finally, there is evidence of great immaturity of  relationships between the sexes within the context of  Christian Church organization.  Quoting a church woman,  I have never heard  quite so much talk along the line of 'All men are  really little boys and must not be frightened by  too much participation of women' and 'Woman's  gifts are for practical matters and not for philosophical and theological consideration' and  'Woman's place is in the home', as I have among  men and women of the church.   I believe that it  will take some profound analysis of the nature of  the ignorance which each has about the other, to  do anything helpful in making possible a new  maturity.   So one of the first places to begin in the church is  to mold opinion.  In the last few years, there has been an increasing  amount of literature criticizing the status of women  today.  Many feel we have not taken full advantage.of  our opportunities  and assumed proper responsibilities,  nor reached maturity in political life.   Programs of  action for the future might seek to eradicate some of  this criticism.   We women have so  much power in  our hands today.   The voting and the purchasing power  is ours.   Remember,   the hand that rocks the cradle   still votes and spends money.  When the Boston Chamber of Commerce put women on  on their Board, the president made this remark,  I  know of no venture calling for complete community  cooperation that achieves success without the support  of women.   I fully believe when we improve the status of women  and they have their full share of equality and responsibility in politics, economics, family and church  life, we'll have a much happier life and, I'm sure, a  more peaceful world.   I think women should keep  their femininity      and achieve their goals as women.  There was this restaurant owner; since there were  many rabbits, he made a special of  Rabbit Stew .  In time, the supply of rabbits ran short, so he added  horsemeat.   One of his customers complained.   The  restaurant owner was arrested and  brought to trial. At  the trial when asked if he was using horsemeat in his  stew, he admitted he was.   When asked how much  horsemeat, he said  50-50 .   When asked what he  meant by  50-50 , he replied  One horse, one  rabbit .  So without ERA, it is  One horse, one rabbit .  So women, Unite. In UNITY is POWER.  Ex-WAVES  reassemble      Own Business     continued ftom page 3  This article is excerpted from a speech given during  the years 1948 - 1952 by Ms. Gail Gable from Ft.  Wayne, Indiana.   The speech was given over 15 times,  mainly at Methodist Churches in the Ft. Wayne and  Ladoga area, and was printed in the local papers.  Ms. Gable who was in her 40's at the time says she  went  to the city churches and out to all the country  churches  to speak for the Equal Rights Amendment.  Married at the time of her E.R. A. campaigning,  Ms. Gable has a daughter (Rosemary Cortez), and a  27 year old granddaughter.   Ms. Gable's husband  Walter died last year.  When asked: Do you still feel the same about the  E.R. A. today, as you did then, the 77 year old Ms.  Gable replied,    I definitely do - in fact, even more  so    Ms. Gable was an early member of the National  Organization of Women.  In the hospital when this interview took place, Ms.  Gable said she  intends to go home soon.   I you would like to send her a note, send it in care  of WOMANKIND and we will forward it to her.  In Indiana, an effort is being made to form an  Ex-WAVES organization.   The second meeting was  held at the Eagle Branch Library, 3320 Lawry Road  in Indianapolis, on Saturday, March 8, 1980.  Twenty women attended the  brown bag  luncheon  and organizational meeting.   Coffee and tea were  furnished, and a great deal of fun and reminiscing was  the order of the day.   The club has registered 55  members at this time and are looking for more to  join.  The next meeting will be on Saturday, April 19th,  at the Eagle Branch Library ( 1 block East of Georgetown Road at 34th Street).   If you are interested in  attending this or future meetings, call Esther Warrick  (317-852-7716, evenings) or Emily Sehr (317-898-  7582) or just attend.

C.  After research in how to start and operate a home  business, I was interested in finding out what other types  of endeavors homemakers had in their homes.   I asked  questions at women's club meetings, church social  gatherings, PTA meetings, etc.   The resulting occupational list seemed endless.  Here is a partial listing:  One woman with three school-aged children operates a  state-licensed daycare home for pre-school children.  Another with a small baby uses her degree in elementary  education to run a reading readiness program for three and  four year old children.  A beautician has converted half of her two-car garage  into a beauty shop.  A retired woman makes beautiful, custom-designed  quilts selling for as much as  300 to  500.  Another woman whose hobbies were needlepoint, crewel  and macrame, sells her hand-crafted wares to a gift shop in  a tourist town nearby, as well as to nearby arts and crafts  fairs.  A musician gives piano lessons in her home to both  children and adults.  Does this list give you ideas? Do you have a marketable  skill?  Does your skill have possibilities for making money?  A business in your home does not require eight hours a day  or even six hours.   If you have two or three hours free, you  can turn those hours into income.  If you have no marketable skills, think about some of the  things you've always wanted to do but never got around to.  Focus on the one skill you would most like to learn. Ask  your local high school about their evening programs. Many  church and civic organizations offer classes in arts and  crafts, cake decorating, ceramics and many other skills.  When appraising your skills, remind yourself that a marketable skill is any service offered that is required by another  person.   Give this careful thought.   If you're a proficient  seamstress, how about alterations and custom -made  clothing. Perhaps your hobby is knitting or crocheting, and  you make beautiful afghans.   You could sell them.  You'll be surprised how quickly word will get  around after a few sales are made  Everyone has a special talent    Yours may need  only to be cultivated to develop into something that  will work for you  Add a dose of self-confidence and you're on your way  Nearly 7 Out of Every 10 Women Born  Between 1954-1958 are Now in the  Work Force  Free University  526 E 52nd St, Indpls.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  VERSE  5.  Late Snow  When snow first came this winter season  We turned to each other and turned up the  thermostat  And turned down the lights, so that we might  watch  The shining flakes float past our windows  To drift down on the laughing passersby, below.  Now, it is March.   Today, it snowed again.  We came home tense and grumpy.   Traffic  had been slow.  We hurried in and changed the thermostat;  Turned on the lights and pulled the drapes  tight closed  Against the sad, stern walkers in the snow.  There can be too much of anything   Third cups of coffee lose their taste: too many  roses cloy.  A song that, new, brought echoes of new love  Sounds thin and empty after many plays  And wine that fired our tongues grows warm and  flat.  So, too, with love.   When we have been much  together,  It is time for winter's end.   Time for changing  weather,  And time for someone new to stand with me  To watch the changing panoply of days.  by MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  Janus     Prophecy  What has become  Of all the dissenters,  The would-be saviors  Of our world?

Seattle, Washington;  San Francisco, California;  And, maybe even some  To Viet Nam.  The rest --  Are smoothed and polished  Members of society      Rough edges rounded off  From constant grating/grinding  Against middle-age morality.  They're  over thirty     Fancy that   How easily they slipped  Into the  over thirty  hat,  Watching with dismay  The  Younger Generation  bring about  Moral decay and religious condemnation.  They shake their heads,  Bewildered by their times,  And wonder how their world survives  The crimes of sex and lust, greed  And love of power.   They steal  Love, lie, and count their stocks,  While silently, unheeded clocks  Slip toward the final hour.  by CYNTHIA C.

        <pagetext>6.  WOMANKIND  Dispelling the Myths: Women  in Other Cultures  This is the conclusion of a three part anthropological article. (See Issues XI and XII  for parts I and II).  byJ.R. LAWRENCE  Women's Center has new director  In most cultures, it is not difficult to understand  the roles assigned to the sexes by society; this, however, is not always the case.   A rather confusing  culture (as far as sex roles are concerned) may be  found in a study of the Kapauku Papuans of West  New Guinea.   The female's personal freedom may  appear considerable, though no specific supporting  data or example substantiate this claim  Within the societal structure, individualism and  freedom is stressed.   It is difficult, however, to  find instances wherein this applies to women except  in the cases of divorce (that is, the presence of this  concept within the society).   Also, the political aspects  of the society are not mentioned in any connection  with women except in cases of divorce; apparently,  then, women have little voice in the shaping or execution of political decisions.  At approximately seven years     a child is given a  plot of land to work.   The  separateness  of the  assigned land helps to underscore the individuality  and independence of the individual.   Children are  not punished or forced into desired behaviors, though  they are reprimanded for undesirable behavior.   As  an adult, the work of the individual is done in such a  way as to make it separate, or easily distinguished  from the work done by others.   Cooperation is limited  to only a few activities, such as erecting a building,  pulling a canoe, or in times of war.  Because women are responsible for a large amount  of agricultural work, it is desired that men marry.  Actual marriages within the group are specifically  dealt with in the form of a bride-price.   This amount  is agreed on by the families of the two candidates and  a date for the delivery of the bride-price is set.   The  actual  wedding  of the couple (their unification) is  the delivery of the bride-price, and the female is  often absent at this  jointure.   Occasionally, the  groom is not present.   The consumation of the  marriage is often done before the actual  wedding..   If the bride-price is not delivered as promised  the  male often pays the bride's family a fee for using  the girl (sexually).  Agricultural work, incidentally, is not the only  activity expected of the female.   She also gathers  insects and amphibians, which are used for food.  Men contribute only sparsely to fishing, and fish  --a source of protein --are netted largely by women.   The pig, which is domesticated, is raised  by the wife, who treats it in nearly the same  fashion she would a child,   she is reimbursed for  keeping the pig(s) by her husband, who exclusively  owns the animal, with money or a piece of the pork.  Thus, within the marriage structure, the individual  work ethic is both continued and compensated.  In view of the bride-price paid and the actual work  of the wife, she is regarded by the husband as a  financial investment. Because polygamy is a feature of  the Kapauka Papuans, the acquisition of a wife or wives  might be described as a  commodity continuum1.    That  is to say:  ... In this way the basic economic cycle  of an increase in Kapauku production is  completed.   Ideally, it may be repeated  as long as one has women to marry and  luck with pig breeding: the more crops  one grows, the more pigs can be produced, through whose sale one acquires  money for the purchase of additional wives.  Therefore, the economic status of the husband is dependent on the number of wives he has acquired.   In  addition, divorce, elopement, or death of the married  woman is considered an  economic problem  which may  greatly hinder a man's financial advancement.  Even when married, co-ownership of anything is  not employed.   A wife and husband possess separate  property, as do children.   This emphasizes the tribe's  individuality.   Paying the bride-price, however, in a  strange way appears to make the husband the  owner   of his wife and the work she will do.   This concept  DO  DR. L S. DUTHRIDGE  OPTOMETRIST  WINDRIDGE CENTER  goes against the principles of individuality of the  Kapauku.   It is, however, supported by a few of the  cultural norms.   Specifically, the husband's right to  wound or kill a wife if adultery occurs, his responsibility for her action in cases of crime, her contribution to his prosperity, and the payment of her bride-  price.   In cases of rape or adultery, it is considered  that the offender has used a woman  without properly  paying for the license to have sexual intercourse.    Most wars are the result of divorce or other types of  marital breach.   However, if a married woman escapes  with a lover and he, in turn, compensates the husband  for her loss, little fighting (or war) will actually result.   This payment also reinforces the concept that  the wife is  owned  by her husband.  The ideal of individuality and personal freedom  is demonstrated by the housing structure of the  Kapauku.   It is normal for the main structure of  the house to be utilized as the men's dormitories  (for the husband and older male children).  Separate  rooms are provided for each wife and their children  (under the age of seven years).   Food is not shared  together by the family; rather, it is distributed by  the husband and each woman eats alone in her  personal living quarters.  It is obvious that the Kapauku are very profit-  oriented.   Few of the headmen of the group may  achieve this status without some measure of affluence, though stature as a headman is not always  based on wealth alone.   Women, therefore, are the  keys to the man's acquisition of wealth.   The counting system is highly developed among the Kapauku  and wealth is calculated by counting all that one  owns -- wives, children, shell and bead money.  So important is their profit-mindedness that a  Kapauku man would probably trade one wife if he  was promised two in return.  The Kapauku, like the Yanomamo, is seemingly  male-dominated.   The theory of  wife ownership   is conducive to this androgenous aspect of the culture, which is underscored by the lack of female influence in political matters.   However, to reach the  goal of individualism and affluence within the group,  the female is apparently the key for fulfilling the  goal,  and the  commodial  use of the wife is the  path taken by the Kapauku.  In viewing the dissimilar roles of women within  these cultures, then, it is not erroneous to state  that women, their work, and their attitudes regarding motherhood are falsehoods which should be dispelled.   Women have and do contribute considerably  to the livelihood of their families by heavy and  difficult labor.   Ideas of motherhood are not commonly  shared, for not all mothers want their children.  Each  culture does not universally embrace the same beliefs  For those in our society who cling to the notion of  biological origin in mothering tendencies and the  female delicacy for work, it is wise to re-examine  the' whys' of our beliefs, for we merely possess a  line of thought that has been dictated to us by our  culture and its processes of socialization.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Open forum held  An open forum on the Women's Revue was held  at Labyris, the women's bar in Indianapolis, at  9 P. M. on March 20, 1980.   This forum was in  response to criticism from the women's community  in Indianapolis and from an article (Reviewing The  Revue) printed in WOMANKIND .  (Issue 12, Pg. 10)  Although the forum was open to all no one of the  12 who attended  had strong criticism against the  show.   Those who did attend did discuss problems  and considered alternatives to make the Revue palatable to all women who attend.  A suggestion and comment box will be availab le  at Labyris for women to put in writing what they  do and do not like about the Revue.   Generally  the forum's consensus was that the Revue has improved and that the negative criticism has helped  it do this.    However, the four performers reminded  the forum that the Revue is mainly a fun night for  performers and audience.

Reclaiming Our Heritage  A BOOK REVIEW OF  Volume I. ANCIENT MIRRORS OF WOMANHOOD;  OUR GODDESS AND HEROINE HERITAGE by Merlin  Stone, New Sibylline Books, Inc. (Box 266 - Village  Station, New York, 10014), 1979, 212 p.      6. 95  by JUDITH RAE  In writing a very special book, Merlin Stone has  given to all women a present to be read, studied,  enjoyed, and cherished.   The title, ANCIENT  MIRRORS OF WOMANHOOD:   OUR GODDESS AND  HEROINE HERITAGE, appropriately reveals the  contents of the book.   By reading it, not only do  we discover long ago forgotten, neglected, and  intentionally obscured facts, but we also view reflections of the power of Womanhood which we all  can - and must - reclaim in our own lives.  In the preface, the author presents her purpose in  writing this book:  Though widely scattered in brief,  often fragmentary, references, a  large body of detailed information  about woman as deity, often as supreme,  onmipotent deity, has long existdd in the  written literature of many cultures, and  in the oral traditions of many others.  Perhaps, in our contemporary quest for  role models and positive images, the  accounts of woman as Goddess, or as  culture heroine, that reveal portraits of  woman as strong, determined, wise,  courageous, powerful, adventurous, and  able to surmount difficult obstacles to  achieve set goals, may be of even greater  interest and value for women of today.  This book also fulfills a ten-year-old family dream  which other mothers and daughters might well use as  encouragement to combine their talents for the benefit of all women.   Stone's daughters, Cynthia and Jenny,  each illustrated one of the volumes of this two-volume  work.  The theme conveyed throughout the entire book relates closely to the writer's purpose:  As I continued my research, the joy  of finding accounts of images of woman  as creator of the universe, provider and  teacher of law, possessor and prophet of  ultimate wisdom, initiator or inventor  of important cultural developments, or  as courageous warrior - continually entice me to carry on with the search -  even on the edge of new discoveries of  images of womanhood, that were far  different from those generally familiar  in our society.  A sculpture and art historian, Stone expertly researched, for fifteen years, a variety of primary  sources.  There were prayers and parts of prayers, rituals and parts of rituals, legends  and parts of legends, titles, epithets,  symbols, inscriptions - that had each  been gleaned from: translations of cuneiform tablets; ethnological and anthropological studies that included accounts of  spiritual beliefs; and translations of the  early literature of Mexico, Scandinavia, Lhina, Ireland, Iran, Wales,  Japan, India, Greece and Rome.   In  addition to this written information,  there were my personal observations of  sacred artifacts that I had studied at the  museums of the US, Europe, and the  Near and Middle East; as well as my  personal observations of ancient temple  sites.  After her first eight years of research, Stone started  writing what she thought was an introduction to the  project.   This  introduction  became her widely-read  WHEN GOD WAS A WOMAN, which is now available  also in French, Danish, Dutch, and German translations.  Because of the multi-faceted nature of the Goddesses  and heroines included, ANCIENT MIRRORS OF WOMANHOOD is divided, not by symbolism, but by cultural  source, into seven geographical parts.   The reader will  benefit by taking Stone's advice to keep a world atlas  or globe nearby as she reads.  Each chapter of the book contains background notes  and then a story or poetic selection for each Goddess or  heroine presented.   Because all of the selections are  interesting and beautifully written, I had great difficulty  in deciding which of the stories and poems to share with  WOMANKIND readers.  Perhaps my favorite story is of Tien Hou, the  daughter of a Chinese family who made their living by  fishing.   One day Tien Hou suddenly went into a coma.  When frantically called back to consciousness by her  mother, the girl upon awakening mumbled,   I should  have stayed just a moment longer.   I should have  stayed just a moment longer.     Later her father and  three of her four brothers came home, telling how  Tien Hou had saved them from drowning.   Because her  mother awakened her, Tien Hou had returned before  saving the fourth brother.   After that incident, her  family never again tried to entice her out of a coma  allowing her to continue to rescue people at sea.  An unnamed appendix lists  Rituals and Commemorations You May Want to Remember.    Included are  not only the Vernal Equinox, Summer Soltice, Autumnal  Equinox, and Winter Solstice, but also rituals of growing, harvesting, thanksgiving, emergence of souls,  and others. And for the female view of astrological  influences, the last page of the book gives a suggested  revision of deities associated with astrological signs.  In ANCIENT MIRRORS Stone's style combines  scholarly serious, yet fascinatingly readable factual  information with a straight forward, rich simplicity of  vocabulary and details in her stories and poetic selections.   The reader feels the author's warmth and  closeness throughout the volume.  If we allow it , ANCIENT MIRRORS OF WOMANHOOD could also offer hope for the future survival  of all people.   As we read of the heroines and Goddesses  of the past, we can apply the ancient lessons of Mother  Nature to the ecological and environmental problems of  today.   The author notes that third century B. C. China  was  a time when all people... were in  harmony with the seasons and with the  ways of nature; animals and humans  did no harm to one another. The  Chinese texts then explain that this  paradise was destroyed by mining  minerals in the mountains, felling  trees to build houses, hunting, fishing,  and even by learning to make and control fire.  Though ANCIENT MIRRORS OF WOMANHOOD is  an adult book, it can be used by teachers, librarians,  story tellers, and parents for relating these woman-  affirming stories to children.   Girls and boys of all  ages will enjoy listening and perhaps acting out  the many accounts of Goddesses and heroines from  around the world.  Upon completion of volume I, Merlin Stone  enthusiasts will want to read volume II.   Each arc of colour may be lovely to behold, but  it is the full spectrum of our woman rainbow that  glows with the brightest promise of better things to  come.   r  T  j:  rG  kddess and  4ev  i*e.   evn* lt;x e. j f T  j   *i*.  jAPfttt * MAy *.xu*/e  .VtfjMS*Os Too lt;*  *    -1 oft 3BMP   SjTb: MeW    2-66-VILLAGE Srtf.y  M.y;N.y.      loot*

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  A String of Pearls  by JILL  CHAMBERS  My mother gave me a string of pearls, a pearl at a  time, one by one.   I'm still stringing them, because  she continues to give them to me.   Their luster goes  deeper than materially possible.   These pearls  illuminate who I am and where I came from.  Although I do not remember the presentation of  the first one, I've carefully preserved the subsequent  pearls in my head.   Today, I've decided to string  them here because I have a headache, and I do not  have forever.   I'm finally stringing them for myself,  for my children and their children, should that be.  The oldest pearls concern my great grandfather and  great grandmother, David and Hattie (Buck) Wilson.  Hattie was born in 1859 and David was born in 1863.  They were married in 1886 in Liberty, Indiana. Hattie  was a staunch Women's Christian Temperance Union  member and a frugal farm wife.   David farmed in  Tipton and New Castle, Indiana.   The two managed  well enough to be comfortable in their old age.  My mother, Margaret, was David's favorite grandchild. Of all the grandchildren she was the only one  who would spend a summer week or two on the farm  with them. Over Hattie's protest he once bought my  mother a dress she wanted even though it was too expensive.  My mother remembers the dresses her mother made  for her, the material, the color and the adult dress or  coat which was cut up to make them.    In their turn,  my mother and her sisters cut up old socks to make  clothes for their dolls.   My grandmother, Alma  Wilson McDowell, had to keep an eye on this industry in order to keep them from cutting up  perfectly  good socks .  Once my mother wrangled a wooden box to replace  her old cardboard doll box.   She remembers placing  the dolls with the doll quilts Alma and Hattie had  made for her.  I have those doll quilts now.   They are well worn  from covering my mother's dolls so many years ago.  They aren't beautiful in terms of material or design  for they were made of left-over scraps.   The best  material went for making and patching clothes,  comforters, and quilts.   However, they   are beautiful because they glow with the reality of the hard  and carefully measured lives that great grandmother  Hattie Wilson and grandmother Alma McDowell led.  Hattie and Alma were both  in service  to middle  class families before they married and started their  own families.   That was one of the few avenues  open to young women who had to support themselves  in the late 1800's and early 1900's.   The training of  caring for other's children, laundering, cooking and  cleaning, was invaluable for the eventual  managing   on their husbands' farm incomes.   My mother, like  her mother and grandmother before her, lived with a  family, kept house and provided child care for  3.00  a week during the 1930's.  Mom remembers one summer when Hattie and David  were in their early seventies.   Hattie had not been well  and David, who was a victim of crippling arthritis,  didn't move very fast.   Hattie was out hoeing her  extensive garden in the noon sun and David spotted her.   Margaret, is that Hattie out there, hoeing in the  garden?  he asked.   My mother nodded affirmatively.   She's been sick.   She doesn't have any business  out there in this sun.   There's plenty time for hoeing when the sun goes down,   he stated as he  started off across the yard.   Rather than go the  long way around the fence, David too took the  shortest path with his slow and shuffling gait. He  yelled at Hattie,  Get out of that sun, you' ve  got no business out there hoeing in that sun  Put  that hoe down    Hattie looked up, but kept right on.    Do you  want me to take that hoe away from you?  he  yelled again.   Mom says she'll never forget what  happened when he reached the fence and laboriously  lifted his leg over the wooden rail.   Hattie's hoe  came flying high over David's head, and landed with  a thud on his side of the fence.  Mom said Hattie was always a little stubborn.  The photograph I have of Hattie and David shows a  short plump woman, gray hair pulled back in a bun,  lace collar, dark print dress and a resolute and somewhat sour look on her face.   She is standing with a taL  lean man with a gentle  gt; bemused look upon his face  and their three surviving children, Alta, David, and  Alma.   This picture was taken on their 50th wedding  anniversary in 1936.   It is a real treasure, a reminder  of that string of pearls.  BOARD1  This award and a similar one was presented to  WOMANKIND editors on November 3, 1979. The  8 1/2 x 11 framed line drawing with the woman's  figure holding a WOMANKIND YES sign was drawn  by Jill Chambers.   The words are done in calligraphy  and are from the women's community in Indianapolis  ...  In love and appreciation for creating a written  record for the matrilineage of women's wisdom and  for giving birth to Indiana's first feminist newspaper  with a nationwide distribution.  Presented at The Woman's Touch Birthday Celebration/Benefit, the evening and the award will be  forever treasured by the editors.  May we all continue to grow and support one  another.  Remembered     Conversation  WOMANKIND READER:   Why don't you print some negative letters?  It's  not fair to print just the good ones.   Surely you get some  hate mail.   EDITOR'S REPLY:   Believe it or not WOMANKIND has received less  than a dozen negative letters, and only two of those  were rather vehement.   One woman was angry because we didn't print her poem; the other thought we  were racist and had  no women of color  in a particular issue.   We knew there were at least two black  women writers in that issue, however, and as we  explained to her:    We don't ask or usually know or  even care what race, color, creed, religion, political  affiliation, etc. our writers are.   We didn't publish  her letter, but we did ask her if we could.   We received no answer.  This issue does have a couple of somewhat negative  letters which we tried to  make right.     We succeeded  at least with one.  Special    Letter  Thank you for your help with my womanscript.  I appreciate your comments and time.   I am trying some of the revisions and wonder why I couldn't  see them?  Am still in search of a publisher and probably  will be for some time.   I have not given up all  hope yet.   Have finished second book and with  your guidance from the first, I am not afraid to  look at it critically.  Also (after revisions) am enclosing some of the  poems that you had indicated you would like for  WOMANKIND.  Perhaps, someday we will be able to meet.  Sharing one's writing with a person I have never  met is a new experience for me.   Again thank you  so much and I do plan to stay in touch.

What better time than Spring ... the  time of renewal, change and new hope.   Roquespiere,   I said the other night,   let's  really examine our feelings about each other. Let's  get it all out in the open.   Let's communicate     Custard cake?  he mumbled as he turned another  page of the sports section,  yeah, that sounds good.    I let out a healthy scream. (Screaming is good  therapy .. . and it gets attention.) He looked startled.   What's the matter?    I was saying ... let's communicate     Oh . Well, go ahead.     I think that in order to improve our relationship  and get rid of any repressed hostilities, we should  discuss what we like and dislike about each other.  We can start with my good points.   He looked thoughtful.   He shifted positions in the  chair.   He knitted his brows, slowly lit a cigarette  and leaned back again, deep in thought.   That's not very funny, you know,   I said.  Surely  you can think of something.   How about my housework  or cooking or ways I handle the kids?   He blew a few smoke rings and continued to look  thoughtful.   O. K. then, wise-en-heimer. Forget the good points.  What are my weak points? In what areas could I improve?   I can only think of three.     THREE  Well, spit it out. I'm certainly willing to  accept mature constructive criticism.   What are they?    Your housework, your cooking, and the way you  handle the kids.    What a rotten thing to say     I went into a gigantic  pout.   It didn't work .   He went back to reading the  paper.   Anyway,   I sniffed,  you have to be more specific.     The house is a mess ... you hate to cook, and the  kids are like wild Indians.     Well ... besides that,     I pressed on.   You never stick to your diet.    That did it.   I blew up.    Well, old buddy,  just let me tell you a few of YOUR faults,   I said  raising my voice.  The kids began to gather around.   They sat on the  floor in front of us, all eyes and ears.   In fact,   I went on in my best shrewish voice,  I  don't think I could list all of your faults in one evening '.  The kids' faces reflected their mounting excitement  and pleasure.   They looked at Roquespiere, waiting for  his rebuttal.   Just remember, my dear,   he said calmly,    when  we were first married, you insisted on making me over.  You made a new man out of me.   And now if you don't  like your creation, that's your problem.   The kids clapped, wet their index fingers and chalked  up a point for Dad in the air.  He was right,   of course.   So I did the only sensible  thing left to do ... went to the bedroom and sulked  ... and contemplated the dumbness of the idea that  every married couple should communicate... besides,  what does HE know anyway?  s    UUomcrShine  Productions   Being Crazy is the Only Thing Keeping  Me Sane  will be performed at the Orchard  Country Day School at 615  W.   63rd  Street  in Indianapolis on April 25,   1980  at 8  P.M.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Success in a Man's Department  or  Hard Wear in the y  Hardware Department  by JACQUE STAMBRO  Inwardly, I was quaking as the hardware manager explained my duties.   Outwardly, I clung desperately to a facade of complete confidence .  I  was a young woman who needed her job and   I was not going to let anything or anyone stop  me from keeping it.   After all, I knew what    a Phillips screwdriver looked like   My first days as a Sears hardware salesclerk were  a nightmare.   The questions I asked were endless:  where are the Yankee screwdrivers kept and what  are spiral ratcheting screwdrivers? (Both are the  same thing called by different names )  What is a  cotter pin puller and do we carry easy-outs?  I am sure I drove my male co-workers up the  wall with my constant questions.   All of them  would answer me in an obviously patronizing  tone of voice while they rolled their eyes at one  another  I felt compelled to learn the terminology of the  department so I began to ask my customers what  uses they had for the various tools they purchased.  Most of the male customers seemed flattered to be  asked for information and they willingly answered my  my endless inquiries    The regular customers would  wait for me to  help  them so they could teach me  more about the tools of hardware.   Gradually, over  three or four months, I realized that I was asking  fewer and fewer questions and answering more and  more questions that were asked of me. I became  confident of my hard-won hardware knowledge and  I begged my boss for more training.  Now, the worst trouble I have is convincing new  customers that I really know what I am doing in the  hardware department.   The majority of customers  The NWMF: A cornerstone  in women's music  For the past six summers, Champaign-Urbana, HI.,  has been the site of a very special event.   Annually,  the National Women's Music Festival (NWMF) brings  together women musicians and lovers of music from  all over the country for a time filled with sharing,  playing, learning, and celebrating.   Concerts, workshops, films, and jam sessions highlight the Festival.  A wide variety of music is presented: everything  from jazz to folk to classical.   The performers and  the audience comprise differing philosophical and  political perspectives and yet there is room for this  diversity.   The uniting factor lies in the Festival's  original purpose: the presentation of music performed,  produced and engineered by women and providing a  forum for the exchange of skills necessary for the  presentation of such music.  The National Women's Music Festival has helped  the growth and maturity of women's music.   Prior to  that first festival no feminist musician had recorded an  album that sold substantially.   Today, over three  quarters of a million feminist albums have been sold.  There are women's production companies in thirty to  forty cities.   Women who weren't accepted by  'establishment' recording industries were given a  chance at our music festival, and later proved to be  very successful in the major, national music scene  (for example: The Roches, Ellen Mcllwaine,  Melissa Manchester).  This year's Seventh National Women's Music  Festival will include thirteen featured performers      among them Holly Near, Meg Christian, Alive ,  Robin Tyler, Teresa Trull,and more.   Daily workshops  covering everything from instrument repair to innovative approaches in teaching, from production to  promotion will be held.   Jam sessions, open mike, and  feminists films    will be a part of the Seventh National  Women's Music Festival which will take place May  29th through June 1st.  Vlfc  *  Ifce   .  lYtt**  who question my ability to help them are women.  A prime example of female disbelief happened to  me two weeks ago.   A woman came into the department looking for a specific tool.   I need a weird little wrench that moves a tiny  little nut down inside the car,   she stated, as I  moved toward her.    Is there a man around here I  can ask?  she continued, in a nasty-nice tone of  voice  I nodded, too surprised to speak, and motioned for  a male salesperson to help her. The old adage  The  customer is always right,   flashed through my mind,  even when SHE is wrong I added mentally, feeling  rebuffed.   She repeated her question to the confused man and received a puzzled look in return.  He turned to me pleading for help with his upraised  eyebrows.   Do you know where inside the car the nut is located?  I asked.   Beside the engine   she answered, impatiently.   Distributor wrench,   I mused aloud, going over  the various possibilities in my mind.   That's the exact word my husband used   she exclaimed, amazed that I would know such a term. I  fetched the curved box -end wrench for her and she,  murmuring about how surprising it was that I knew my  way around hardware, bought the wrench. I struggled  hard to keep from retorting that, after a year in the  hardware department, I had better know my way a-  round in it.  I have enjoyed the never-ending challenge of  learning hardware and I know that I never want to  return to the mundane routine of selling ladies'  clothing.  Women's Media Directory Available  THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE for FREEDOM of the PRESS  (WIFP) has released the 1980 INDEX/DIRECTORY of  WOMEN'S MEDIA listing 265 women's periodicals; 51  presses and publishers; plus women's news services,  columns, regular radio and TV programs; and women's  media collectives and companies in film, video and  cable, music, art/graphics/theater, and multi-media.  The directory includes numerous other categories such  as writer's groups, professional media women's organizations, and media-and-women courses.  The entries include addresses, phones, and descriptions  written by the women themselves.   The purpose of the  DIRECTORY is to encourage and promote communication  from women and among women, nationally and internationally.  The WIFP has found that herstorically women make  progress when they have a means of communication,  and go backwards when they lose communication with  each other.   Therefore, there is a section of individual  media women and media-concerned women   women  who asked to be included to build a supportive communications network among women.  WIFP consists of hundreds of women working together  to expand exercise of women's right to freedom of the  press and extend it to ALL people.

In the future I wo uld be known as  Judith Rae.    This was what I wanted; why did it bother me?  I had asked my lawyer to find out if I could legally  change my name from Judith Rae Rogers to Judith Rae,  (I was fortunate to have a middle name that could be  used as a last name.) but, when I saw those two typed  words, Judith Rae, I felt uncertain.  Changes can be frightening and I was going through  many changes.   Could I withstand one more?  Part of me said I had to change to Judith Rae because  my lawyer had already done the work. If I reneged, the  paper would have to be re-typed.   I didn't want to  cause extra work; nor did I want her work to be fruitless.  After a deep breath, I said,   Mae, I feel uncomfortable about this.   I thought I  wanted my name changed, but when I see it on paper,  I'm not sure.   I feel bad that you went to the trouble,  but I just don't know if that's what I really want.     Well, if you don't want to, that's OK.   The second  page can be re-typed.   When do you need a definite answer,  I asked.   As soon as possible.   Before the nineteenth of  November, but hopefully sooner,   she answered.   OK, I'll think about it and let you know.    THE   PROS   AND  CONS  Judith Rae Rogers  (1) My sons told me they didn't want me to have a  name different from theirs.   I could understand their  feelings.   At eight and ten years old, they are influenced by what they feel others will think of them;  they don't want to be different.   But, I realized, I  could not make a decision on my name based totally  on what my sons wanted.   The decision had to be what  I wanted.  (2) I didn't want to hurt my father.   Because divorced  women who change their names usually reclaim their  maiden names, my dad would want me to return to  Giles - as my sister did after her divorce.   But I  couldn't make this decision based on my father's  feelings anymore than 1 could on those of my sons.  (3) WOMANKIND and other magazines had published  my work under Judith Rae Rogers.   Although dropping   Rogers  would not be a drastic change, it might be  confusing.   WOMANKIND said they might consider  publishing an article to announce my new name  because it might give support to other women considering such action.  (4) rm used to being  Judith Rae Rogers.      At first it  would seem strange to be  Judith Rae  and  Ms. Rae .  But if I could adapt to Judith Rae Rogers after twenty-  one years of Judith Rae Giles, surely I could get used to  another change.   When I got married over twelve years  ago, I had felt proud of having a new name.   Of course,  back then I saw things differently:   I had caught a husband  - a good catch, one of the first in my college class.   Now  I had his name.   Whoopie   (5) People might have difficulty contacting me if  they didn't know my new name.   I decided I should  write or telephone friends to tell them my news.   Or  maybe I could send out birth (of a new name)  announcements   (6) At work I prefer not to call attention to my divorce.  I know people will find out, but I don't want to broadcast it.   Having a new name might do that.  (7) I dreaded all the work involved: notifying utilities,  credit card accounts, bank, work, grocery store check  cashing, Social Security, Dept. of Motor Vehicles, etc.  But my lawyer explained since the change was going  through court, it would be a simple matter to inform  such places.   I could send form letters announcing my  name change to publishers holding my manuscripts,  etc.  Judith Rae  (1) Having had difficulty facing the reality ot my upcoming divorce, I thought dropping my husband's name  would be a positive affirmation that the marriage was  indeed over.   It would help me quickly face the cold  facts of divorce.  (2) Wanting to free myself of negative feelings of  the past, I asked myself how I felt about being called  Judi Rae and Judith Rae.   As a child, I didn't like being called  Judi Rae;  I preferred  Judi.    Intellectually,  Continued to page 11

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  The first five years are the hardest...   4 1    A*.  Genevieve was in graduate school in political science  when the foam failed and she turned up enceinte.   Her  husband, Richard, was in medical school. They were  intelligent people.   If they were going to be parents,  they wanted to do it right.  Cindy was born in Richard's first year of medical  school.   Gen dropped out of her graduate program.  A nurse was brought in to help Gen through the first  confusing ten days because she knew nothing about  newborns.  With Cindy she was suddenly alone.   The day  after the nurse left, Richard went to school, taking  their only car.   Gen was left alone at home with  the new baby.   The house was totally silent when  the baby slept.   Not even a clock ticked because the  two clocks in the house were electric.  Gen's routine became as important as class schedules  and reading assignments used to be. She read when she  wasn't washing, hanging out clothes, folding diapers,  cleaning house, doing dishes or sterilizing bottles.  But somehow the reading she did at home lacked  purpose.   It was undirected.   She knew she would  never go back and finish the Ph D because ultimately  the degree had become meaningless to her.  The summer after Cindy was born, they decided to  go away on a vacation.   Richard had a job doing research in a laboratory forty miles away.   He loved  his job.   He would leave at 6 a. m. to beat the freeway traffic and get home at seven or eight at night.  But this one night he' d promised to come home  early because they were leaving the next morning.  The long empty day had stretched before Gen like  all the days preceding it.   Six o'clock came and Cindy  was bathed and bottled.   Then six-thirty and Cindy was  getting sleepy.   Gen sat down in the rocker in front of  their picture window.  She looked out the window at nothing. The baby fell  asleep in Gen's arms.   The watch   ticked on her wrist  to seven and quarter after, then seven-thirty.   She didn't  move except to keep the gentle motion of the rocker going.   She was marooned in space, but underneath this an  enormous tidal wave of rage was building.    She didn't  know that wave was beginning to lap around her back  teeth and struggle to overflow until Richard came driving  up at quarter to eight, running up the front steps.   Hi, I'm sorry I'm late.   We had to get that last  batch of animals sacrificed.     I don't suppose anybody else could have done it?   He stopped at the tone of her voice. The baby  stirred on her lap as she tensed her stomach muscles.   Well, no,   coldly, retreating from her disapproval,   I'm the only one who knows the protocol.     Oh.   And that was all.   The wave receded.   Her teeth rooted  back into place.   But the vacation was spoiled for her.  by  LAUREL  SPEER  As her despair deepened (and she didn't know that  it was even there) she began to project ahead and wonder.   They wanted other children but she didn't want  to be changing diapers forever.   So she decided she  would do it all at once.   There was a kind of despair  in that decision.  Andrew was born during Richard's third year of medical  school.   Richard was involved in his psychiatry rotation,  which meant both day and night care of hospitalized  patients.   Andrew was a big baby and he was bom fast.  His lungs didn't open completely and he was placed in  an oxygen bath in the premature nursery.  Gen was not allowed to hold or see the baby. The  prognosis was optimistic, but the possibilities were  terrifying.   The first afternoon of visiting hours, no  one came to visit her.   Her mother was taking care of  Cindy.   Her in-laws were both working.   And Richard?  Richard did not call.  That night, everyone came except her own mother,  who couldn't bring Cindy on the maternity ward. Gen  was lying in bed, her hair freshly combed, in a new bed-  jacket, smelling her flowers that everyone had sent. She  was engulfed in attention.   And then Richard walked in.  He went over to Gen, put his arms around her and she  burst into tears.   She couldn't stop crying.   The in-laws  looked embarrassed.   Richard signalled his parents away  and they discreetly left the room.   What's the matter, Gen?  said Richard, his most  sympathetic self.   Why didn't you come?    When?    This afternoon.    Well, I had class.   You knew that.     But just this once, couldn't you have skipped class?    Well, no,   slowly, thoughtfully.     I came tonight.    But tonight wasn't enough.   And the silence deepened  around the cacaphony of screaming babies.  The third baby, David was born the February  of Richard's last year in medical school.   Surely,  this would fill her life, her every waking moment.  But three, she knew, was her limit. Richard heaved  a sign of relief and accepted the most prestigious  internship in the city. He knew Gen would be busy  at home. He planned to move his family across  town to a new location,  to rent a home,  to move,  to get settled before the internship started in July.  They were so busy, but there were also many  empty spaces in their busyness.   But the place was  so great, the new house, so much to do every  minute of the day, graduation, a week's vacation.   And then July.  Richard disappeared.   Richard went away and didn't  come home for a month.   When he came home, it was  at one or two or three in the morning. He had to learn  how to be a doctor now.   And it was taking him 20 to 24  hours a day.  esther fuller  consultant to women  in business and the professions  p.o. box 314 zionsville, in. 46077   50.00  per hour  317-299-2276  Who could she blame?

Could she blame herself for failing  to come up to it?  Clock whirring. Seven o'clock. The babies in bed.  The house empty. And read. For the first time in her  life, succumbing to the great emptiness around her  and inside of her, trying to fill gaps by eating junk  food.   She gained weight. First ten pounds, then  twenty, then almost thirty. She was horrified at  herself.  She started smoking again.   She hadn't smoked since  she'd been a graduate student.   It wasn't a good example for the children.   Now she smoked  defiantly.  Sometimes she'd sit and drink with a friend.   But  mostly it was the eating.   The gain had already edged  over thirty pounds and she knew in a detached, despairing way that she was out of control, that something inside her was trying in every way possible to  tear her to pieces and she was frightened.  One night, Richard was sitting at the dining room  table, bolting his warmed-over food at eight o'clock  in the evening.   Gen tried to talk to him, tried to  appeal to the physician in him, if nothing else.   She  ended her story of uncontrolled behavior with the plea,   Richard, what'll I do?   He looked at her and ruminated.    Well,  he  announced in a flat tone,  just stop eating so much.    All this happened a long time ago.   Really ten  or twelve years ago, but an eon in terms of distance  traveled.   The kids now go to school.   Gen has put  in her time with the under five year olds. She has  her own car.   She can go out to lunch with a friend.  She can read a book, but she doesn't have to stay in  the house and have that be the only thing she can do.  She can go to a tennis court and not worry whether  she's home when the kids come home from school.  Richard is practicing medicine.   He and Gen are  close and loving when they come together. The large  gaps when they're apart don't matter anymore because  they have become two adults functioning as autonomous  people, the way they were before Cindy was born. Gen  doesn't depend on him coming home for dinner. If he  does, it's nice, but she puts no pressure on him;  to provide that.   She's filled her life with other things.  But when she sees a young mother walking a baby  in a stroller.   Or when she goes to a park and sees the  toddlers in the sandpile with the mothers sitting on the  benches.   Or when she's in a restaurant and a mother  comes in with her three kids clutching at her with  grimy, seeking hands.   Then she remembers and  wonders if there might've been a way for all that to  be avoided or if, inevitably the first five years with  children are like that.   She has no answers.   She  only knows she's put in her time, and she will never  do it again.  Don't  give    up  If your article or contribution did not appear in  this issue, don't worry.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  11.  Women in Public Office  u  s   In U.S. history, 103 women have  CONGRESS  SENATE  served in the Congress compared to  11,400 men. Ten states have never  sent a woman to Congress.  The 96th Congress has one woman.  In 1979 Nancy Kassebaum was the  first woman to enter the Senate without previously serving in the House of  Representatives or being appointed to  fill the unexpired term of a man.  Since 1922, 14 women have been  appointed or elected to the Senate.  REPRESENTATIVES  Out of 435 members of the  House, the largest number  of women to serve at the  same time was 19 in 1975.  Reprinted from May, 1979 Fact Sheet from the  Office of Sarah Weddington, WasETngton, D. C.  HOUSE OF  Unique Name  continued from page 9  I wanted to be known as  Judith  - my real name.   But  whenever I heard people call me  Judith,   I felt somewhat strange.   Since my mother was the only person  who ever called me  Judith  - usually when she was  annoyedjwhen I heard  Judith  I immediately felt  I had displeased my mother.  (3) As mentioned earlier, Judith Rae is two -thirds  of the name under which I had started publishing -  not an enormous change.  (4) If I changed my name to Judith Rae, I would  have my own name.    It would not be my husband's  name.   It would not be my father's name.   It  would not be my mother's fathers's name.   It would  be  MY NAME.   Though I did not feel comfortable  making such a dramatic change as that of Una  Standard, (author of MS. MAN),   I did like the idea  of having my own unique name.  (5) Affirming that I was a crusader, I wanted to live  what I believed - women should have their own individual names and not be just  Mrs. Husband.    A DECISION  IS REACHED  Although I will be the same person whether I am  Judith Rae or Judith Rae Rogers, I think it was vital  that I made my decision slowly and with careful  consideration.   A person's name IS important.  I am pleased to announce to WOMANKIND  readers that I am now Judith Rae.

WOMANKIND  P.O. BOX 16306  INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA  46216   New woman  novels all alike?  by  ROBERTA   LYNCH  Books on and by the  new woman  have been  erupting with the rapidity of gunfire over the last  few years -- frequently occupying places on the  bestseller list and even edging out gothic romances  in the supermarket paperback racks.  I have read nearly all of them, sometimes curiously, sometimes dutifully, occasionally with real  pleasure. Generally, however, they have left me  frustrated that the energy and vision initially generated by the women's movement should be so ineptly or erroneously translated into the intimate  stories of women's lives. Lately, though, there's  another aspect that's struck me.  In the past month I've been through Sara Davidson's  LOOSE CHANGE, Erica Jong's HOW TO SAVE YOUR  OWN LIFE, Marge Piercy's THE HIGH COST OF  LIVING, Marilyn French's THE WOMEN'S ROOM,  and Gael Greene's BLUE SKIES, NO CANDY.   Of  the latter, despite its endorsements from Steinem  and Freidan, that one is more anti-woman than  new woman in my book.  In some ways it's not fair to simply lump all these  books together:   the quality of writing varies widely  among them, as does the feminist sensibility.   Yet  after awhile I couldn't help but get the feeling that  I was reading one long novel.  The women who occupy these pages are almost  invariably white, middle-class, and seekers of the  self.   In nearly every case, the women's movement  or even the left touches their lives, at times very  deeply, but usually without acknowledgment.  Their struggles to, as Jong puts it,  save their own  lives  seem to leave them completely unconcerned  with larger social issues, except insofar as their  personal dynamics are concerned.  It is this self-absorption that I have found so  annoying.   It's as though these books have been  based on the letter, but not the spirit of the  feminist slogan  the personal is political.    Yet there is another side to this continuing  saga that must be noted as well:  it is the very  desperateness of this search, a sense that something is awry in people's lives.   Gone is the  initial elation that was part of the discovery of  collectivity in the women's movement.  These  books miss the feeling that so many women had  that they were reclaiming themselves, getting  to know their bodies and being able to speak  their minds.   This sense of freedom may have  been only temporary, but it was not illusory.  It was rooted in a tremendous optimism about the  potential for change, and grew out of a sense that  such change was a shared and historical process.  Due in some measure to the lack of social or  institutional support systems for its values, the women's  movement has not been able to make good on its original promises of personal fulfillment.   And I realized  in reading this latest batch of books that individual  women really have been thrown back on their own  resources to an alarming degree.  This may go a way toward explaining why these  books - - rather than an inspiring sequel to SISTER  HOOD IS POWERFUL - - are topping the bestsellers'  list. Their appeal is not solely, or even primarily,  in their eroticism, as some claim. It is rather in  the fact that their obsessions are shared by millions  of people (including many feminists) who have not  yet found a social vision that has the power to engage them fully or that seems to offer the potential  :o transform their lives for the better.  There seems to be a longing for stability and a  deep desire for human connection in these books.  It is ironic that the self-absorption of the male and  female psyches seem to be dead ends in this respect.  The books are all permeated by a pessimism about  the permanence of human relationships, despite the  most passionate love affairs or the strongest bonds of  friendship.  Sara Davidson says of the aftermath of the Sixties:   The center held, but we're all in pieces.   We're  like loose change.     Davidson may be right about  the  we,   but she's wrong about the  center.    It  didn't hold either, despite the fact that neither the  sixties   values nor the left politics have come to  predominate.   The  center    itself is washed by  changing tides, and lack? any clear sense of direction or meaning.  It is women whose new perceptions and quests  have been so potent a force in stimulating such  change.   It should come as no surprise then that  it is women who are living at the edge of it;  whose writings, however superficially, mirror it;  and who scan the pages of these novels with the intensity of a radar device searching out their own  lives.  These books seldom reflect the particular situations of minority or working class women -- their  differing pressures, their more limited options.  But they do seem to be speaking to a common experience that binds women in many different life  situations.   There is in their pages a recognition  that we can never really return to the way things  were     and that we wouldn't even want to, if we  could.   But there is also a longing for a new  center   for human relationships that are caring and constant,  for changes in men commensurate with the passages  that women have made.  It is no coincidence that this intensifying of personal  trauma comes at a time of political confusion and setbacks.   This is not to say that there is some simple  equation between political activity and personal fulfillment.   But it is to remind ourselves that the personal dilemmas that so often appear as private and  individual are in fact bound to larger social factors.  And it is to suggest that there are few genuine alternatives for how we live our lives unless we make  changes in the world in which we live them.

Watch  your local television scheduling  for its premier performance in your  area.  Womantime   Co. is a visual, upbeat,  public affairs program which examines  through film, videotape, slides and  interviews the many changes going on  in America today. The overall emphasis  of Womantime   Co. is on two main  areas: patterns of lifestyle, and the  changing relationships of individuals  to each other and to existing social  institutions.  Womantime   Co. has evolved into  more than a viewing alternative. It  is an ongoing chronicle of the dynamic  social changes that are causing women  and men to take a new look at themselves and their relationships as  America moves toward the twenty-  first century.  Gerri Lange, Womantime   Co. host  for the past two seasons, is well-known  among San Francisco Bay Area television viewers. Hosting Womantime    Co. comes quite naturally to Ms. Lange,  who is also the former host and producer of her own show, Point of View.  The response to Womantime   Co.,  and the enthusiasm of the viewers,  was far greater than expected. In addition to the originally programmed  daytime slot, KQED soon added two  evening showings as a direct response  to viewer requests. Now women all  over America can enjoy the series, in  an expanded national edition over PBS.  Womantime   Co. began two seasons  ago as a daytime experiment at KQED  San Francisco. The series was intended  to provide women with an alternative  to the soap operas and game shows  which dominate daytime television.  The West, and especially the San Francisco Bay Area, is still a frontier for  social change in America, and thus is  an appropriate setting for this weekly  half-hour. Locally, Womantime   Co.  has focused on such subjects as the  impact of women in the job market  and homemakers returning to school;  teenage runaways and parent-teen  communication; the use of drugs such  as Valium to counteract depression;  non-traditional jobs and job sharing;  alternative methods of childbirth and  childrearing; the impact of women in  the political arena; women in the arts;  widowhood; divorce; new marriage contracts. And the list goes on.  As a national series, Womantime    Co. will continue to look at the changing American scene through the unique  perspective and distinctive contributions of women. Possible interviews  include, from the public sector, Shirley  Temple Black, Margaret Mead, Betty  Ford and Representative Yvonne  Braithwaite Burke. Equally important  will be guests such as Tom Wolfe,  poet Maya Angelou, Roots author  Alex Haley, actresses Liv Ullmann and  Mary Tyler Moore. A continuing feature on the new series will be filmed  mini-docs of  a day in the life of. . .   women and men from all walks of life.  ... focusing on issues of  concern to women and the  men in their lives.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 3  Are We  Our Own Worst Enemies?'  by Ms. Rebecca Pitts  ACCORDING to a fairly recent  issue of U.S. News and World Report (March 28, '77),  Chances  for ratification of the equal  rights amendment are dead for this  year, and perhaps permanently,   We may well suspect a certain a-  mount of latent anti-woman hopefulness in this remark; still, the  facts just now are grim enough,  and grimly ironic. Here I would  like to examine with you some of  the ironies, as well as the greater issues, which are involved. Especially important is the curious  fact that women often are, as an  irritated woman friend of mine put  it not long ago,  their own worst  enemies,   Xt should be clear from the above  remarks that although I believe  E R A to be vitally important and  desirable for all women(whether  working women or full-time housewives, old or young), the ultimate  subject of this essay is not the  amendment itself. Preliminary  points, to be sure, must  focus on  the shameful ironies in the present  situation. If a nation whose President is currently on a world crusade  for human rights   a nation whose  very foundations are the principles  of  equality  and  rights    if this  nation rejects the equal rights  amendment, we shall have permanently  defaced our image and weakened our  credibility in the world community.  What a set-back for world womanhood   for suffering and exploited  women everywhere  And what a ludicrous shame that the crucial blows  which killed the amendment were  struck by American women   Next, in trying to see what  motives the  stop-E R A   women  can possibly have, I must briefly  consider, and answer as clearly as  space will permit, the principal objections such women and their male  allies have made use of. The arguments against E R A as a legal .  measure are logically not valid at  all, and they would deserve no  attention here if they did not  show so clearly the muddled  thinking  and irrational prejudices  which underlie them. For these  apparent arguments against the  amendment are really attacks on  those feminists who (among others)  support it   a kind of  guilt by  association  where the innocent  measure is concerned. Such objections are undergirded, moreover,  for a surprising number of people  by a very narrow interpretation  of Judaeo-Christian traditions at  least three thousand years old.  At this point I am reluctantly  forced to hint that even the most  intelligent and balanced feminists  have often been, in terms of strategy and the movement's public image,   their own worst enemies,  (It must  be added that the necessities of  struggle have often made this unavoidable, )  In other words  religious  and  moralistic assumptions about the  biological limitations and limited  social role of women are playing  a very great part in the present  confrontation of forces. It is  these assumptions that deserve our  ultimate consideration,, They have  little or no connection, to be sure,  with genuine religious faith and experience, and even less with any enlightened code of ethics. But  millennia of cultural conditioning  have insured their rootedness not  only in men but in women; and the  only weapons against them are steadfast, well-planned political action,  clear rational thinking, and a positive set of goals (moral, and   yes     spiritual) which are broad enough  to include religious women as well  as the militantly secular   full-time  wives and mothers, as well as working  women.  Ms, Pitts  retired English Professor  IUPUI  BUT TO RETURN to the more immediate and practical considerations  first* Since there is always  danger of a reactionary backlash,  the present outlook for women is  fairly grim. At least it is grim  if you care that working women  should not have to have to stagger  much longer under a heavy load of  unfair discrimination as to job  opportunity and pay. It is grim  because there are still l   states  that have not ratified the equal  rights amendment; three more approvals are needed before March  1979; and in every one of the  foot-dragging states one or both  legislative houses have rejected  the amendment at least once. If  the measure is to pass in at least  three more states, some new legis-  tures will have to be elected.  It is probably true that, even  if E R A is defeated by March, 1979,  piece-meal legislation (and Supreme  Court rulings, like the recent abolition of discrimination in Social  Security) will eventually make a  constitutional amendment unnecessary. But this would be a long,  costly, and exhausting way to win  full equality for women before the  law: in some states, without constitutional enforcement, it might  take   who knows?   generations. And  at best, equality gained so slowly  would forever lack the final stamp  of constitutionality   the final,  open rectification of a great historic wrong.  9  Meanwhile, in the broadest possible way, the situation is grimly  ironic. We live in a time when despite any private person's privately  held prejudices and bigotry, no  American citizen dares   literally  no one dares   to question publicly  our American principles of  equality   and  rights  in any area save this  one. And ERA simply would make it  the fundamental, constitutional law  of the land that no citizen be discriminated against or denied full  legal rights because of sex. Its  major provision reads:  Equality of  Rights under the Law shall not be  denied or abridged by the United  States or by any State on account of  Sex.  In other words it would be  mandatory in every state to enact  legislation to implement this principle in terms of insurance, pensions,  divorce, and child support   as well  as equal job opportunities  (for the qualified) and equal pay for  equal work. But at present eleven  Southern states, and Illinois,  Missouri, Nevada, and Utah are rejecting this principle.  An even stranger irony, however,  is the fact that the most effective,  singleminded, indeed monolithic  movement to stop E R A is made up of  women themselves. Not that they  constitute any kind of majority. But  they are a very noisy minority, who  have proved quite influential upon  wavering, vote-conscious, and none-  too-liberal legislators. Their  most prominent leader is probably  Phyllis Schlafly, who recently fulminated:  The plain fact is that  people don't want ERA and are fed  up with militant women trying to  force social change.  The charge of   militance  would be funny If It  were not fairly sinister, in view  of the fact that the  stop-E R A   women who have been mobilized in the  last couple of years vastly exceed  their opponents in militance   if not  in rationality. The rest of Mrs,  Schlafly's pronunclamento is a good  I example of her falsifying technique:   the plain fact  is that 70  of the  states have already accepted E R A     and they are the largest, most populous, and most highly-developed  states, on the whole. And the only   social change  involved in the a-  mendment is the affirmation that  women too   even women   are implied  in what are the fundamental ideas  of the American tradition.  None the less I think we need to  come to grips with what Mrs. Schlafly  has suggested. It may not be a   plain fact,  but it is certainly  more than likely, that in every  state   not merely those 15 stragg-  lers   there are many people, men and  women alike, who for various reasons  are bitterly opposed not only to  ERA but to the principle of sexual  equality on which it is based.  Some of their avowed reasons are  techical and practical, and can be  dealt with rather quickly here,  since all it takes is a little logic  and a few hard facts to dispose of  them, Tliey have, unfortunately,  been very effective in influencing  women votersJ and therefore they  are the overt and obvious reasons  why ERA may never become part of  the constitution. We must deal with  these examples of Muddled (or dishonest) thinking before we can face  certain greater questions,  cont'd, to p. k

        <pagetext>Page U  cont'd, from p. 3  Opponents of E R A have naturally  failed to say openly that women, as  people, should not have  equal rights.   Instead they have focused on certain  threats   largely imaginary and always  misrepresented   which the measure is  said to present. ERA has been  associated with fears that the American family is in danger of disintegrating; with anxieties about homosexuality and increasing divorce  rates; with the  danger  that if women are not hedged in with  protection ,  their husbands will no longer support  them and their children. It has even  been said that, if E R A were ratified, states rights would go by the  board and the Supreme Court would  end up making all our marriage and  divorce laws.  There are some fairly obvious answers to all this, if people would  only think. The most ironic facts  are these: ERA has not yet been  accepted, but the American family  has been in grave jeopardy for many  years   and not because of any alleged  rights that women have won; the same  thing can be said for the appalling  escalation in divorce rates   not to  mention the increase in (openly acknowledged) homosexuality among men  and women alike. These are troubles  deriving from social, cultural, (except for homosexuality) and economic  factors of such weight and complexity  that whole books have been written  about them which could hardly scratch  their surface. Such difficulties  would not miraculously disappear     they might not even be greatly diminished   if we were to write into  our fundamental law the principle  that no one   not even a woman   is to   be denied equality of legal rights.  But full constitutional equality  would not intensify these problems,  either.  Two of the arguments against  ERA, or so it seems to me, are especially foolish   muddle-headed, if  people honestly accept them, yet obviously trumped up as vote-catchers by  demagogues and politicians. (A spokes*  man for the Conservative Caucus has  admitted that anti-E R A sentiment is   a good recruiting tool. ) First, it  is claimed that the amendment may  well force wives to leave their homes  for work because their husbands will  no longer have a legal obligation to  support them and the children. The  second objection is closely related  to this: that in case of divorce  women may have trouble in child-custody, alimony, and support cases.  Both arguments are advanced under the  guise of  protection  for women.  As for the first argument, women  are not at present protected (nor  will they ever be protected) by failure to ratify ERA, According to  Labor Department figures nearly half  the children in this country have  mothers who are already in the labor  force   most of them because of grave  economic necessity, although this  may or may not have anything to do  with their current marital status.  In other words not merely divorced  women with children, and single   career  women, but millions of wives  in relatively stable marriages (whose  husbands would like to support them)  have been forced already, quite unprotected, into the labor market.  It is true that a very small minority of happy wives enter the pro-  WOMANKIND  fessions later in life   perhaps to  put several children through college, perhaps to maintain a standard  of living the husband alone cannot  maintain, or perhaps for sheer fulfilment of their own potentialities.  All of these are profoundly human and  justifiable reasons for working at  whatever they are qualified for. But  these women too, like the vast majority  of their less fortunate sisters in the  labor force, married, single, or divorced, are unprotected. Unprotected  against the gross discrimination with  respect to job opportunities and pay  which keeps them frustrated and for  the most part shockingly underpaid in  comparison with male workers. And for  the overwhelming majority of working  women, to be a member of the labor  force now means, not only insecuritv  ( last to be hired, first to be fired,   as the blaoks used to say   and often,  because their jobs are technically  part-time, no fringe benefits); it  also means practically no opportunity  for advancement, and pitifully low  wages wherever a job is to be had.  E R A is designed to give all these  working women genuine protection a-  gainst such inequities.  But what of the second objection?  It is true that every real right  implies a real obligation. It is also true that although ERA seems today to be a strictly woman's issue,  the amendment actually means equality  between the sexes. Broadly-speaking,  therefore, all divorce, support, and  child-custody cases would be tried on  their individual merits, with no  special privileges accorded to women  purely as wives and mothers. ERA  merely requires that state support laws  be based on income: that is to say, if  a divorced woman makes less money than  her ex-husband she can claim support;  if the reverse is true he could claim  it, though at present this would be  a very unlikely possibility. As for  continuing marriage, the breadwinner,  male or female, must support the  spouse who stays home with the children  (if either of them has to do so).  When we consider the present plight  of the majority of working women (and  especially deserted or divorced women),  and the advantages they would soon  gain under ERA, none of this seems  at all threatening. One point should  be added, however, with respect to  both the objections just dealt with.  Undoubtedly there are many husbands  who do not support their families out  of affection, or even out of a basic  decency and a sense of honor, but  solely because the law requires them  to do so. Such men are notoriously  likely to walk out any day and disappear, leaving helpless wives and  young children on Welfare and   if  lucky   part-time employment. Such  men are also very hard to bring to  book, and their support payments are  often in arrears or totally missing.  It is difficult to see how ERA  could worsen situations of this sort.  And yet the determined opposition  to the measure which has swayed lawmakers in several important states,  and nearly succeeded in killing it in  many others, has had the r  massive, even fanatical, support of  women themselves. It is easy enough  to understand male resistance to any  challenge whatever to male superiority.  But however deep this half-unconscious  resistance may be, it does not seem to  9  have been decisive with legislators.  A woman's vote is as good as a man's  among vote-hungry politicians, although doubtless many of them were  glad for the conspicuous backing of  the anti-E R A women. It is also  easy to surmise ways in which business  and industry might fight the measure,  at least covertly: after all a fluid  supply of cheap labor is a profitable  asset. But what are the real reasons  behind the opposition of so many  women? There are two fundamental  reasons, in ray opinion, for this astonishing phenomenon.  TO BEGIN WITH, a great many women  still seem to be unable to think  clearly and rationally enough   men  say this is a typically  feminine   incapacity, although on this issue  men too are equally afflicted by it  to judge the equal rights amendment on  its own merits. Hence women, along with  male collaborators, have been  susceptible to all kinds of false  allegations and illogical arguments which arouse their deep-  rooted fears and resentments. We  have examined some of these  arguments  in the preceding section,  as well as the anxieties with which  they are associated.  In this connection it is noteworthy that 11 of the 15 recalcitrant states lie in the South.  (The appeal to states rights, incidentally, was made by a North  Carolina lawmaker). And a strong  majority of the population in the  South has always been made up of  fundamentalist religious groups,  which are marked by their rigid  conservatism and fear of change;  by their acceptance of Biblical  sanctions for woman's role   sanctions drawn from the ancient  Jewish past; and by their susceptibility to moralistic propaganda,  however specious. The assumptions  underlying all this are culturally  conditioned and very powerful.  Women themselves cannot begin to  doubt them until they learn to think  clearly.  Needless to say such attitudes are  not restricted to the South; they  are merely intensified there. In any  case, it is safe to say that neither  the Southern women who have up to  now succeeded in killing ERA, nor  those women who have opposed it  elsewhere in an active way, are  really representative of the working women of this country. They  are women with at least a little  leisure, and enough money to devote  some of it to their purpose. And  they have obviously not been thinking about the situation of less  fortunate and hard-working women.  In a confused and angry way, however,  they probably have been  thinking   about dangerous change; about the  American family and juvenile delinquency; about the frightening  general decline of morality in  America society.  The point is that they have not  really been thinking at all, (NOR  the men who take the same position  and advance the same arguments, adding that  not even the women want  this kind of thing. ) Instead they  have all been governed by an irrational resentment against the feminists movement and the conviction  cont'd, to p, 6

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page     SISSY  Nikki Harris Readus   Leave the house when the  pains are fifteen minutes apart,M  the clinic nurse had said.  Go  to the emergency entrance of County-  Hospital and tell them your name  and age and that you're a clinic  patient.   Everyone's busy. The lines of  injured people waiting frightens  me. A man is standing next to me  with blood dripping from his arm.  Two other men are leaning against  the wall, chained together, one  with a cut across his forehead. I  walk through the crowd and approach  a fat nurse at the front desk.   My name is Sissy Taylor,  I  begin,  and I'm fifteen years old.  The nurse at the College Avenue  Clinic told me to come here when  my labor pains were fifteen minutes  apart, and they sure are.    Have a seat. We'll be with you  shortly,  the fat nurse says, looking down, instead of up at me, causing her glasses to fall in her record book. Then she quickly turns  around and starts talking to someone else.  Where am I to sit? This place is  so crowded, it looks more like a  grocery store. People who say a  hospital's the cleanest place one  can be in haven't been here. Nobody's washed the walls for weeks,  and the blood that dripped from  the man's arm is still on the floor.  I won't be able to sit long  anyway. Why do I have all this  pain? He hasn't suffered anything  since I got pregnant. I hate him.  Before this, he talked nice and  sometimes would even take me places.  I felt good because no other boy had  ever asked me for a date. But when  he made me pregnant, he treated me  like it was all my fault, I bet he's  at some dance right now. I wish all  this pain would leave me and find  him to make him know how it feels.   Sissy Taylor,  a student nurse  in a blue uniform calls from a list.   Sissy Taylor, follow me please.   She motions for me to come with her  down a hall with beds of patients  lined against the walls. She stops  in front of what might be called a  room.   Undress? Okay? A doctor will  be in to examine you.  She's much  nicer than the fat nurse at the front  desk.  I hope I don't have to stay  here the entire night. It's not  really a room, just curtains,  which haven't been white for a  long time, separating me from the  woman in the next bed. At least  there is a chair in here. The  clock's high enough for everyone.  It must be to time these pains.  I wanted Momma to come with me,  but no one would be home to watch  the kids, The kids are an excuse  though, because she's left them  when she wanted to go out. And  none of my friends have come. Besides, I have no friends except  ones curious about how I look.   Sissy, my name's Dr. Spells,  and I will be delivering your  baby.  A doctor  He reminds me  of a bald midget I saw at the  circus.  Put your feet in the  stirrups, so I can check and see  how you're doing.  He has a  Southern accent. Now I'm really  in trouble.  I have never seen him before  and he's examining me. His hands  are ice-cold and the way he  presses on my stomach makes me  want to use the bathroom. I  would hurt less if he'd examine  a little slower. He must be in  a rush to look at someone else.  I am tired of feeling shame.   Shame on you, Sissy,  and  You  should be ashamed,  that's all  I've heard. It's been awful to  walk down the street and have  people stare at me, not at my  face or feet but at the bulge  in the middle. Shame makes me  want to rid myself of this ugly  bulge, sometimes makes me want  to die. I remember when Mama  took me to that doctor to have  an abortion. (Dr. Spells reminds me of him.) The only  thing he was interested in was  the money. It was terrible  lying on that table with only a  sheet covering me while he and  Mama argued. If she hadn't got mad  at him there would have been an a-  bortion and I'd be at that dance  right novi. Maybe not, I might  have  died, dirty and nasty as his office  was.  I felt ashamed even around  other pregnant women. On clinic  days, I usually kept my hands  folded or in my pockets because of  no ring. The women always looked  at each other's hands, maybe out of  boredom. I almost stole a gold band  once, so my hands would be free to  point and hold things without  glances from my stomach to my left  hand.  cont'd,  to p.  10  t JiTES PUFFY AND WATERY.  t WEARING  NEW CONTACTS IS LIKE I  ; LOOKING  THROUGH A WET,  RAIN :  J STREAKED WINDSHIELD   J WITHOUT  WIPERS.

        <pagetext>Page 6  cont'd, from p. k  that feminism as such   including,  of course, the amendment which  feminists have supported and its  specific implications   is the chief  danger to social morality and the  American family today. Such  guilt  by association  reminds us of the  McCarthy era. But this kind of  sloppy thinking should not blind  feminists to the disquieting fact  that a deeper and more serious kind  of  guilt by association  is also  involved.  The plain fact is that the contemporary movement for the liberation of women has been too much entangled with other kinds of rather  more questionable  liberation.  I  do not mean that these other issues  (whatever their individual merits)  are questionable merely from the  viewpoint of a rigidly narrow moral-  ism. Conventional people with the  prejudiced attitudes we have been  examining would certainly condemn  (hypocritically, no doubt) all forms  of pre-marital as well as extramarital sexuality; they would dismiss homosexuality with horror; and  they would be likely to consider all  cases of abortion, regardless of  circumstances, as cases of murder.  No wonder, then, that feminism is  discredited forever among unchangeable reactionaries. What I do mean,  however, is that even among people  of social vision and legal, psychological, and ethical insight there  are grounds for sharp disagreement  about the social, consequences of  encouraging abortion, open homosexuality, and complete freedom  in sexual conduct generally.  It is easy to see, of course,  why feminists have become involved  with special-interest causes which  attract far more attention from  the public as a whole than do the  broader and deeper objectives of the  women's movement. For the issues of  abortion, complete sexual freedom,  and lesbianism are indeed related to     and deeply rooted in   the basic  predicament of all women who are  struggling, in a sexist society, for  freedom, opportunity, and some kind  of realized selfhood. But the cul-  trual climate in America today is  obviously not hospitable to such a  head-on challenge; and very likely  by the time it i   ready the challenge  will no longer be needed.  Meanwhile, at this time when the  struggle for legal and economic  justice is by no means won, the  women's movement needs to broaden  its base a good deal, and win active  support among more women and men  alike. And there are in this  country, in fact, women numbering  many hundreds of thousands, who  are confused and on the fence about  feminism, but perfectly capable of  clear and independent thinking.  They come from many age groups and  occupations, including that of  full-time wife and mother; some of  them are political liberals and  others are arch-conservative except on the woman question; but  WOMANKIND  they are all, because of intelligence, and sensitivity to their own  experience, potentially active feminists. At present, however, they  hesitate, though they may now and  then, not only vote for ERA but  give a little money, or write to a  Congressman, or even subscribe to MS.  Perhaps they hesitate because,  although they want liberation from  the frustrations of a sexist society,  they need some answers to the question  Freedom for what?  To an overwhelming extent these women are   straight ; they may be quite understanding, even tolerant, but they have  no wish to be labeled as lesbian.  Moreover, like many women already  active in the movement, most of them  are baffled by the appalling legal  and ethical complexities of the a-  bortion issue. And finally, a great  many of them are genuinely religious  women, whether Christian or Jewish.  If so, they have probably been  touched already by that exciting  ferment of religious feminism which  is effecting a revolution in the Protestant churches, and the synagogues     which has even caused a tremor in the  Roman Catholic fortress. The broader  (and more political) secular movement needs these women and their creative collaboration if the whole  cause of women is to reach its full  development     To win these women I have been  describing, and the friends and husbands they may be able to influence,  secular feminist leaders and the editors of widely-read feminist magazines may need to modify some of  their policies a little and begin,  at least, to clarify their long-range  philosophy. It might be a very good  idea, for example, to formulate  clearly a morally realistic, defensible policy on the issue of abortion, and then to state this policy,  repeatedly   in the women's press in  every issue, and elsewhere as often  as feasible. It ought to be possible  to make not only potential feminists  but the general public see why in  certain happily rare but terrible  cases abortion is absolutely ethical  and ought to be made medically and  legally safe and financially accessible in every state in the Union.  The American public is not likely  to tolerate much more than this; but  if this much is not done, we are in  danger of what the Catholic bishops  have recently proposed: an anti-  abortion, and anti-contraceptive,  an independent womens newsjournal  women in struggle  politics, health, work, prison  news coverage and political analysis  on the issues that affect womens lives  contributing sub  12 or more  one year sub  6    sample copy 60   foreign  13    Canada  7  business and institutions  20  oob, 1724 20th st. nw,  wash, dc 20009  amendment to the constitution which  if it passes will be a permanent  and drastic curtailment of whatever  rights women now possess.  Still another hint may be  offered here as to editorial policy  in widely-read feminist magazines.  This has nothing to do with the  brilliant reportage one usually  finds there: articles on child abuse,  sexual and other; reports on rape,  wife-beatings, etc.; and discussions  of cases involving professional injustice to lesbians, or legal injustice to divorced lesbian mothers. My  suggestion does, however, have much  to do with a kind of compulsive urge,  on the part of some women contributors,  to  tell all  about their private  lives   in print   with uninhibited candor. It would seem wise to ban all  forms of sexual confessionalism  ( straight  as well as  gay ), not  because some of us find it in bad  taste and sentimental in all the  worst ways, but because it is precisely what is most likely to be  noticed, hastily condemned, and re-  menbered by potential allies as  well as enemies of the feminist  cause.  My last suggestion has to do  with the need for all feminists  to clarify their longrange philosophy. But although the crucial  question here is  Freedom for  what?  this has no connection  with blueprints for Utopia or  plans for social action. Instead  it takes us into the dimension of  personal selfhood and a much-  argued question   a question so  profound, so much obscured by  at least twenty-five millennia  of repressive custom and cultural  conditioning, so much in need of  real illumination, that it has already required many books to begin  to discuss it adequately. What will  women be like if they are free     if they are really equal, though female, human beings? And is this in  fact, possible?  WITH THIS question we come to the  second fundamental reason why so many  women have opposed the equal rights  amendment. For even today the sad  fact is that most women seem, like  the great majority of men, to be  dominated by age-old traditions  about woman's nature and her special  need for  protection,  But the  mask of male chivalry only partly  hi es the male conviction that  women are not only biologically  different, but biologically  fated forever to narrower and  less responsible roles and a  less rigorous education than men  are. In other words, woman is a  naturally inferior creature: inferior, because her one primary  function is motherhood, whether  she fulfills it or not   a function  which in spite of its value for the  species keeps her subject to earthi-  ness, the flesh, and bodily processes,  and therefore incapable of clear,  concentrated thought and the higher  reaches of art, science, and spirituality.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  THE LONG RIDE  J. C. Starker  Margaret Brown walked slowly  through the fair, her huge hips  rolling with each step she took  toward the mid-way. A strand of  wiry, gray hair kept jumping up  on the top of her head, but she  did not bother to push it back  after three unsuccessful tries.  She had left her monotonous office job early, treating herself  to an hour of freedom. Lately  she had possessed a mad desire  to fling everything off her desk  at the close of the day, to rush  back to her rented room, to rip  the cheaply furnished room apart,  and to throw away all she had meticulously saved through her lonely  life. At first these feelings  had frightened her, but once she had  begun to lose her fear she found  she could giggle over them in the  darkness of her midnight bed. She  smiled comically. Today was her  birthday and no one in the whole  world noticed. She felt as  though she alone knew the  great importance of the number fifty.  Hucksters called out to her as  she was jostled along the sawdust  trail. They beckoned wickedly  with toss rings and water guns  while winking outrageously.  Margaret laughed in abandonment,  shaking her head girlishly toward  them as her large breasts joggled  onward. She didn't want to waste  her precious money on their rigged  chances for success. She had carefully decided what she would give  herself as a birthday surprise.  She roared with delight at her  own ingenuity. How foolish, how  silly, how right everything was  today.  At last the bright lights of the  carrousel jiggled into view. She  hastened her steps and greedily  took the stub from the dirty,  skinny ticket agent. Anxiously  she waited for the horses to stop  their endless circle of prancing,  while mumbling to herself that the  attendant was giving the children  much to long a ride. Finally the  gate was opened and Margaret's  worn shoes tripped over the upward  step onto the platform. She fell  against a young mother who turned  and stared at her in disgust,  Margaret ignored the hateful look  and struggled through the pushing,  selfish children until she spied  Page 7  the tall black horse and grabbed  him possessively. His flared nostrils were painted cherry red,  his mane was adorned with yellow  tassels, and he seemed ready to  explode into action at the  slightest command. Margaret  patted him gently as she pulled  herself onto his saddle. Her  buttocks squished over the horse's  sides onto his back as she vainly  tried to make herself fit onto the  narrow seat.  The music began as the carrousel jerked to a start and  Margaret grabbed the pole rising  up through the horse's head,  clinging happily as her ragged  purse waved in the breeze.  Around and around the carrousel flew; up and down Margaret rode. She felt as light as  a young girl; she felt as slender  as a new blade of grass fluttering in the summer wind; she was  free, like the floating wonderful dreams she had begun to have  lately,   What the hell do you think  you're doing?  the attendant  demanded, stumbling over to her.  His face floated up and down, confusing Margaret.  Don't you know  you're too fat to be on that  horse? You're supposed to ride  in the coach,  he shouted  roughly.  Crazy old people are  supposed to ride in the coach,   he muttered, stalking away,  Margaret dropped her empty  purse which would be trampled by  rough, loud children when the  ride ended. She rode silently,  unable to stop her journey as the  wild stallion plunged up and  down on the carrousel, its red  nostrils flashing hot before her  stinging eyes. Her lips began to  quiver and she shouted for the  long ride to stop, but no one was  listening for her cry.  WAITING  I have to wait for the fish to  bite  my  bait.  I have to wait for my dad who's  al  ways  late,  I have to wait for the ice, so  I  can  skate.  I have to wait till I'm old e  nough.  to  date.

        <pagetext>Page 10  cont'd, from p.    WOMANKIND  Why does Dr. Spells come in here  so often? It seems the sheet has  been lifted up at least a hundred  times.  The pains will start  moving closer together, about  five minutes apart. Let's not  have any screaming, it will only  make your pain worse.  (He must  be crazy. I have to do something  as much as it hurts.)  Sissy,  they will also be harder.   Harder  I'm not ready. There  shouldn't be anything like being  pregnant, like having babies. I  wish somebody I knew was here to  talk with me and be my friend. I  wish God could talk to me and explain this.  God, tell me what am I to do?  Let this child die. It will be  better off dead. I can't afford  to feed it, and Momma's house is  too crowded. Paul doesn't care  for anyone, especially me and this  child. Dear God, let one of us  die, I don't want anymore of this  pain. I feel another one beginning,  and I can't stop it. Dear God,  Help.  Everyone in here has been white.  Here comes another nurse, at least  she's black.  Sissy, you are  having a difficult delivery. But  it shouldn't be much longer.  She  talks much nicer than the doctor.  It's too bad she can't deliver it.  Time hasn't moved at all. Who-  ever said watching time makes it  seem longer was right. I feel I've  been here for days. The second  hand on the clock keeps moving  steadily while I lie here and  move nowhere. I see the nurse is  bringing me some water. I was  going to ask her for some. She  must have some idea what I'm going through.  Be a good girl and  push. Hang in there, Sissy.  She  helps me hold the glass.  Push, that's all I hear. The  pain becomes worse and this lump  hasn't gone anywhere. I'm tired  of straining and I can't stand  much more.  This room is too small for all  these people. It looks like a  class. Maybe Dr. Spells is the  teacher. Surely, he won't let  them all look at me.  Sissy, I  want these young doctors to take  a look at you. I'm sure you won't  mind.   Yes, I will. I wonder why  different doctors keep coming in  and checking me like a piece of  meat in the market, picked up  and poked at by anyone who passes  by. I heard them say something a-  bout how I'm part of their medical  school class assignment. They tell  me to push harder and then shake  their heads. Something's wrong.  If the child is born dead, I'll be  able to go back to school   not to  Tech, but to a different school  where no one knows me. Why can't  I push anymore? Dr. Spells should  tell me the reason, for they're  shaking their heads. It must be  almost over because the pains  don't seem as hard.  0 Lord my God, in thee do I  put my trust; save me from all  them that persecute me, and deliver me; oh God, I'm fifteen and  I don't want this baby. I wonder  if it will be a boy or a girl. It  doesn't matter because I'm not keeping it. I watched by brothers and  sisters enough without having to  take care of this baby   but it  might look like me and have curly  hair I could comb...  Yea, though I walk through the  valley and shadow of death, I will  fear no evil, for thou art with me;  now I understand those psalms Grandma repeated all the time.  The doctors shouldn't have  dimmed the lights because they  won't be able to see. I can barely  understand what they're saying.   Sissy, we are taking you to  the delivery room now.    Please don't move me. It hurts  terribly when I try to move.  This  hall looks as dirty as the others.  I'll never come here again. Where  is the nurse who gave me the water?  My mouth is so dry I can barely  swallow. This must be the delivery room. The lights are  brighter. I wonder what the different machines are for. Dr. Spells  looks better in the green outfit.   We have to move you one more time  onto the delivery table.   The pain  is worse.  Tell me what's wrong.   I know they hear me but they won't  answer. The pains are sharp and  stabbing, coming too quick. I can  barely hear the doctors talking to  the nurses and everyone seems to be  moving in slow motion, looking at  me as if they're scared. I want to  scream out, but the words won't  come. Now they're bringing a new  machine. Oxygen, I think someone said. It's growing colder in  here and people are moving slower.  I'm tired   cold and weak. The  room is darker and I'm going to  sleep for a long time. I think  another doctor is rushing through  the door. It doesn't matter. I'm  through fighting, I'll give myself  to God. I want to wake up and be  around someone who cares. He  watches over us. He knows, He  cares...even for the flowers and  the little sparrows.  vil  THEWOTMMJ  lDMCHinc  6352 W 37ih ST IN VIUAGC SQUAW                  F   MINIST BOOKSTOR    specializing in  feminist presses' publications  Non-sexist children's booK gt;  Women ortists' worlds  Ootids, music, photography  A UNIQUE PLACE  Plus: posters, stationary,  teeshirts   vibrators  HOURS:  Tues-Fri 10-9, Sar 1 - 0  Raintree  Florist  GIFT ITEMS  3734 N.

BOX 16306  J      INDIANAPOLIS. INDIANA     46216  *K  lk  *  Margaret Sanger went to jail  for distributing birth control information,.  one  one  by Ms. Paula Lawhead  Dental Assistant Student  Professional Careers Institute  Quiet? Humble? A modest woman?  This may describe some women, but not  Margaret Sanger. She was a  self-  proclaimed heroine  who fought for  what she believed in and in the end,  made life better for women all over  the world.  She was born in Corning, New York  on September Ui, 1883, the sixth of  eleven children born .to Michael H.  and Annie (Purcell) Higgins. Margaret  was educated at Claverack College,  studied nursing at the White Plains  Hospital, and did post graduate  work at the School of Manhattan Eye  and Ear Hospital all of this in the  State of New York.  While working as a nurse, she  realized the uselessness of nursing  unless she was able to relieve the  misery she saw every day. In 1921  she quit nursing to fight for what  she believed in that a woman should  be free to make her own decision  about the size of her family.  Margaret wanted to educate mainly  the working class, not the upper and  middle classes, who already practiced  or knew about birth control. She  felt that the most unwanted children  were brought into the world by the  poor. Hardships in that class were  enlarged by low wages, poor living  conditions and the lack of knowledge  of birth control devices.   No woman can call herself free  who does not own and control her  body,  was one of Margaret Sanger's  beliefs. She strived to stress the  fact that working class families  needed no more than two children  because the average man couldn't  support more.  She also criticized the act of   coitus int rruptus  because it  often left the woman unsatisfied.  The man was fulfilled but it often  left the woman with a feeling of  emptiness, loneliness and the sense  of not being loved. Margaret  believed that if the woman was left  unsatisfied, lovemaking was not mure  than an act of prostitution, which  was potentially harmful to the woman.  Abortions were available if a  woman could pay a fortune for a  quick, but often painful operation.  Many doctors did the procedure on  the side in a secret place, often  in the dirty room of a hotel.  Abortion wasn't the answer because,  many women died due to the lack  of cleanliness and training, plus  it wasn't legal.  Her own personal life, in the  meantime had expanded. She married  .William Sanger in 1900 and had three  children, Stuart, Grant, and Peggy.  The marriage ended in divorce. In  1922 she married J. Noah H. Slee;  he died in 19li8.  During this time, many changes  were occurring. Women were beginning to speak up for their rights.  In Europe, Rosa Luxemburg of  Germany and Anatole France of France,  proposed that workers undertake a   birth strike.  This compelled  Margaret to begin her fight for  birth control in America  Page 11  She began by publishing a  magazine called  Women Rebel  in  191li and she organized the National  Birth Control League, that year.  At the time (191b) there were  two laws in the state of New York  that stood in her way:  Section 11l;2 stated that no one  could give contraceptive advice to  anyone for any reason.  Section 11li5 stated that only a  physician could give advice to  prevent conception if it was for  the cure and prevention of venereal  disease,  But, Margaret was a daring woman,  and on October 16, 1916, Fauna  Mindell, Ethel Byrne and Mrs      Sanger opened the doors of the first  birth control clinic in America.  It was located at Ij6 Amboy Street  in the Brownstone section of  Brooklyn. This, at the time, was  a relatively poor section of  Brooklyn.  She knew there would be trouble  from the police and she was right.  One morning Margaret Whitehurst  came to the clinic and told a sad  story of her life and asked for  assistance and birth control information. She received the  literature and promptly took it  to the District Attorney's office  and secured a warrant for the  three ladies' arrest. Ironic  that it was an undercover policewoman who tried to close the clinic  for the goals Margaret Sanger was  reaching for would help women all  over the world.  However, Mrs. Sanger refused to  close the clinic doors so she was  charged with creating a public  nuisance. Then the clinic was  raided. The women in the waiting  room were bullied, questioned and  names were taken. They were finally  released at Mrs. Sanger's insistance  She herself spent 30 days in the  workhouse, but soon after, was back  operating her clinic. Over the years   she was jailed 8 times.  In the 1920's she traveled to  Japan, China and England for the  International Birth Control  Conference. In the 1930's she  traveled to Russia and India for  further conferences. She concentrated most of her efforts in  India for she felt they had the  most serious population problems.  In 1929 her clinic was raided  again, but to no avail. The United  States Circuit Court of Appeals  modified the Federal  Comstock   Obscenity Act of 1873, which had  classified contraceptive literature  as obscene material. They also  affirmed the right of the physician  to prescribe contraceptives to  patients in need of them.  Margaret Sanger was now able to  operate her clinic legally and her  clientel grew with each passing day,  Women in New York were thrilled for  now they had a choice. They could  eliminate the embarrassment or  expense of an unwanted pregnancy.  Finally in 1937 the Committee  on Contraception of the American  Medical Association also stated  that a physician had a legal  right to prescribe birth control  to patients.

        <pagetext>Page 12  cont'd, from p. 11 MARGARET SANGER  was finally winning her battleo  Many credited her with helping  solve the population crisis.  In 1939 the League and the  Education Department of Birth  Control and the Clinic Research  Bureau united to form the Birth  Control Federation of America.  This organization later became  the well-known Planned Parenthood  Federation of America. Few  realize that Margaret Sanger was  its first president in 1953   Mrs.  Sanger also was awarded the honor  of being the first woman, to be  named the Humanist of the Year in  1957.  Margaret was a prolific writer.  Her most important publications:  The Case for Birth Control (1917),  Happiness in Marriage (1926).  Motherhood in Bondage (1928), My  Fight for Birth Control (1931),  and Margaret Sanger's Autob-  ogranhv  (1938),,  Margaret Sanger died in Tuscon,  Arizona on September 1lj, 1966*  The obstacles she overcame in the  field of birth control should  be long remembered as one of the  greatest accomplishments a women  has ever made to society. She  freed many women from fear of  unwanted pregnancy. She believed  birth control was a major problem  in our  country and fought to solve  that problem. She accomplished a major  hurdle in the struggle of women for  the freedom they so deserve    WOMANKIND   lt;UX     EPILOGUE  To know m  re about Margaret  Sanger,  one should read her 1938  autobiography and then the recent  biography Margaret Sanger2 Pionppr  of the Future by Emily Taft Douglas.  For an interesting,  but male slanted  dooV review read Thf* Satn ny gybing Post. May-June 1977 by John  Alexander,    It is a good review  even though Mr, Alexander sees fit  to remark,    It is somehow reassuring  to learn the champion of sex could  be sexually attractive, unlike some  more modern achiever's in women's  lib.     I guess Mr.  Alexander hasn't  seen or doesn't know Gloria Steinem  or many attractive women of the  feminist movement.  Ms. Taft's book points out that  H, G, Wells thought that Margaret  Sanger was the greatest woman in the  world and that the birth control  movement she had started would  be  the most influential of all in  controlling man's destiny on earth.   Today public schools teach the  physiological facts for which   Margaret Sanger was reviled,  denounced,  condemned,  shunned  and  even jailed.    She campaigned in  Japan for birth control 5 times;  that country is proof that planning can  can halt a runaway population.  They owe her a great deal.  In Ms,  Taft's book,,  the intimacy  with Havelock Ellis is discussed  in detail and the desire for Margaret  by H   G, Wells is shown in his letters  to her.    Her friendships with Julian  Huxley,  Rabindranath Tagore,  and  Prime Minister Nehru show that  Margaret had many facets and all types  of friends and relationships,  H, G, Wells said:   Alexander the  Great changed a few boundaries and  killed a few men.    Both he and  Napoleon were forced into fame by  circumstances outside of themselves  and by currents of time, but Margaret  Sanger made currents and circumstances,  When the history of our civilization  is written,  it vnll bp a biological  history and Margaret Sanger will be  its heroine,     From her window in the  nursing home, Margaret Sanger  watched the sun go down and the  world grow dark. In just one night,  by tomorrow's sunrise, there would  be 160,000 more babies on the  earth. This quickening growth put  her achievements in agonizing perspective. At this rate, world population would double before the next  century and triple not long after and  so advance with ever-increasing  speed. Technology had postponed  the old restraints, famines and  plagues   but had brought new evils.  Man was overloading the once clea,i  air, water supplies, even the earth  itself, as well as all utilities and all  cultural institutions. Sheer proliferation was lowering standards to meet  the needs of quantity. Experts  agreed that her program now offered  the only hope of progress with peace  and rational solutions, but the will to  promote it was still lacking.   In the darkening room, Margaret  Sanger closed her eyes. As a last legacy, she longed to leave her sense of  urgency in coping with man's supreme challenge.   3UC  one  one  3*9G  PROFESSIONAL  CAREERS  INSTITU'  Paramedical Careers  Paramedical Office Management      Dental Assistant      Medical Assistant (AMA Ar.credited)      1tn4ettoec4A  Bridal Consultations by  Sharon Fjeld  Fashions of Exquisite Elegance  Wedding Gowns - Brides Maids Dresses  Mother of the Bride Gowns - Invitations  923-5615  2323 TV.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  JEANNE McKENZIE  SO MET H IN'  Page 13  SHE'S REALLY  EXTRA  Big  is  Beautiful   I feel like Ifm just another  person in the world, I have as  many privileges and opportunities  as anyone else and I would rather  live here (in the U.S.A.)than anywhere else. I want to accomplish  things in my life.   With these words Jeanne  McKenzie, the owner of a clothing  shop for large women called  Somethin' Extra, summed up how  she feels about herself. Interviewing her was delightful and  what had been planned for a half  hour extended itself into over two  hours. Jeanne, herself, is really  something extra.  Attractive with soft, black  curly hair, she wears neat and  youthful attire, Smiling warmly  and sincerely, she informs us that  she weighs 280.  Jeanne doesn't hesitate when  she gives her weight( everybody  can see Ifm not a size 10 ), her  height - between 5*8  and 5  9W, or  her age     almost 33* At one time,  Jeanne weighed 320 and in high  school she was a chunky l  0. What  is different about Jeanne is her  attitude about weight. She says  she is Mnot inhibited  by it and  even though she wears a ib6-1*8 top  and a h2-Wx  pants, she insists she  and other women can  look good.   Women and girls who come into her  shop near Ft. Harrison on Post  Road off Highway 67 are  thrilled  to death  that shefs heavy. (Large  females probably find it ego shattering to be waited on by petite  size 5 gt;'s). Because Jeanne realizes  that being heavy poses a health  problem, she is not thrilled about  being overweight and she encourages  females to lose weight, but declares  they can look and feel attractive at  whatever weight.  Jeanne started her business  about 3 years ago, but the first  year was spent in research     mainly  by reading about the business and by  looking at catalogues. A trip to  Chicago by herself was somewhat  frightening because of the traffic,  but once Jeanne located the company  (Huntington1s) she went  right to  the president and he was the nicest  person and he gave her lots of  advice.  Jeanne didn't know she  was going against protocal and she  was probably a very refreshing  change for the president.  Her whole approach to business  has been unorthodox. Except for  high school, Jeanne has had no  actual training to prepare her for  running this shop     except empathy  and understanding, The reason she  got into this particular business?   I never could find anything to  wear for myself  so she had to make  her own clothing. Today Jeanne has  little time for sewing because her  shop is open from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M.  daily except Sunday. With her own  system, Jeanne says she knows  everything that's on the racks  even the  items that have been stolen and the  girls who took them. She is more careful now and less trusting, but feels bad  that she has to be.  At her present location for over  a year, the sign on her window advertises in bold numbers 32 - Zh  and 1      to 32i  , Somethin1 Extra is in smaller  print, Jeanne said  heavy women recognize these numbers  and that's what's  important, Jeanne feels she is more than  a businesswoman. She feels she renders  a service by providing quality,  relatively inexpensive, youthful,  and good looking clothing. She  promises no or little shrinkage  (unless you use a terribly, hot  dryer), but suggests you wash and  dry jeans first before you shorten  the legs. She prefers American made  clothing because  we should keep our  people working  and also because   imports don't really come in large  sizes     even if they say so , plus  the quality is poor.  At Jeanne's the customer feels  good and quite comfortable. There  is no high pressure and Jeanne is  honest with her customers. She  often asks  how does it feel on  you?  Her dressing rooms are large.   I got in there first myself ,  says Jeanne.  Jeanne would like to have a  silent partner, an investor, a  backer     she's certain it would  be a good investment for someone.  However, she wants to run her place      her way. Using her money for  quality and quantity in order to  have a good selection, Somethin'  Extra does not have carpeting and  the interior is quite plain.  Jeanne knows what is really important.  Her family seems supportive.  She has 3 children (1U, 13, and 8);  her husband is a ceramic tile setter.  Jeanne claims her son and 2 daughters  will learn her business and her husband's.  She feels that parent's skills should be  passed down to their children.  Anything  my husband or I can do -- whether they  use it or not , they should learn.  However , she continues,  I want them to be  whatever they want to be.   Jeanne believes in spanking and  she also is a selective T.V. viewer  and will not let her children watch  everything that is shown. Jeanne  says she is a good cook. One of  the problems about working is the  late hour for dinner. Jeanne has  tried to get her family to dine  earlier without her, but they prefer to wait.  How does Jeanne manage to find  time for her family, her work,  and herself. She says,  I just do  it   and*I take time out for  myself.  Not having the T.V.  on constantly is a help. It especially gives her time in the  evening to talk with her children.  And she does do some housework  before she leaves in the morning  and of course does a couple loads  in the washer,  Jeanne grew up in the Lawrence  area and attended high school there     Her not-wealthy parents still live  in the same home where she grew up.  Jeanne has a brother and a sister,  the latter helps her in the shop  and they seem to have a warm  relationship. Today Jeanne and her  family live  out past Washington  Square in the country.   A fascinating woman, Jeanne is  interested and concerned with the  problems of old age. She believes  old people need their independence.  She also worries about young children who have emotional problems,  Physical defects like having big  ears and being taunted by other  children become emotional problems*  She wishes she could get children  to accept each other and themselves, Jeanne is disturbed by  destructive children and doesn't  even like for  her children to say  they   hate something or someone,    A bom-again Christian, Jeanne is  quite religious and regularly attends a Baptist church.  In her work or in her family,  Jeanne says she tries to take care  of problems before they start. But,  however, if problems arise she says  she overcomes them in the best way  she can and she  just keeps on  going.   You should meet Jeanne McKenzie  whether you're a size 10 or a size 20,  You would like her, I'm sure and  wish her success   Bookstore  101?s W.

This is it, this is the moment we have  all been waiting for, the birth of a  new baby   our newspaper      WOMANKINDU  The Treasures of  Don't miss the King Tut exhibit  at The Field Museum of National  History this summer. It will be in  Chicago until August l  th and it  may be years before it will be loaned  to the United States again.  Some suggestions:  1. Leave earlyI From Indianapolis  6:00-6:30 would be a good time. We  left at 7 and could have had a shorter  wait if we had left by 6.  2. Go on a week day and if you're  short of funds Friday is a free day.  No charge to get in nor to view the  special Tut display.  3. Park first. Don't drop someone off to run in and get your numbered tickets. (We tried this) Your  entire party or family will each get  one ticket and they will be handed  to you in consecutive numbers. Needless to say you don't want your numbers  to be far apart because then you won't  get to visit the Tut stuff together.  U. After you park (Soldiers Field  parking lot will probably be as close  as you can get) walk to the closest  entrance and after entering (paying   1.50 for adults, 50   for children  and students, 3    for senior citizens  or the lump sum for families  3    0 on  week-days) go to the middle of the  building (you're on the main floor)  and get your Tut tickets.    . Depending on the time, you can  have a good breakfast or lunch 1 floor  down at the cafeteria. We had  sausage, eggs, toast, hard rolls with  plenty of butter, and excellent 2    joffee. You could bring in some of  your own edibles and eat in the  canteen where vending machines and  tables are provided. Suggest you  make the sack small and throw it  away after eating. Don't carry a  bulky thermos, cooler, etc.  6, While downstairs check out  the regular Egyptian exhibit. It  is extensive, fascinating and prepares you for the richer display  that you've traveled to Chicago  to see. (Notice the Egyptian thong  sandals that are popular again with  the teens today).  TUTANKHAMUN  7. By this time your number may  be seen on the T.V. monitors. We  waited a little over two hours, but  with breakfast and the one area we  visited the time passed quickly.  When its your turn, go upstairs to  the 2nd floor where you will be  admitted at the proper time.  8. It's somewhat crowded-but  squeeze in and don't miss anything.  Spend a few minutes looking at  each object. It will take a gooc  hour to see everything.  9. In a large group? Don't try  to stay together. Twos are o.k. Instead go through at your own pace  and meet on the outside at a designated spot. (Preferably where the  chairs and benches are on the same  floor).  10. After everyone is together  you might go down to the canteen  and have some milk, coffee, soft  drinks, or whatever. You'll need  to recharge if you intend to look  at anything else. We did take the  anthropology test afterwards (display  tablets and answers on the inside),.  If you've have had an anthropology  class or you're interested in this  subject, you'll like this. The rest  of the day is yours and you could  spend it in this one museum alone.  However, we were too tired to want  to see anything else and we didn't  want to spoil the Tut high, so we  left and walked out the North  entrance. A perfect day with clear  blue skies beckoned us through the  walk-through  tunnel towards the  lake and the Aquarium. A sightseeing boat was about to leave and  since we had saved money on  Free  Friday  we took a half-hour ( 2.00  per person) cruise. It was a good  way and a new way to end the trip,  with a look at the Chicago skyline.  When you visit Tut's Treasures we  hope you have a splendid day like  we did    TUT   TUT   ARE IN CHICAGO  N004159  TREASURES Of  TUTANKHAMUN  Field Museum of Natural History  April 15     August 15, T977  Present this pass at entrance  to exhibit when the number is  called.  Valid date of issue only.  Before you go you might like to  read featured articles on King  Tutankhamum in these magazines:  The Smithsonian (November, 1976),  National Geographic (March, 1977),  or The Saturday Evening Post (May/  June 1977 )    Try your neighborhood  or central library for these issues.  You will enjoy your visit even more  if you have done some extra reading  and research.  The Central library informed us  books on Tut have a waiting  list to read them. The librarian  also mentioned that the archeologist  Howard Carter has a 3 volume first  hand account called The Tomb of  Tutankhamum and that there is a  condensed version in 1 volume  with the same title.  If you miss the Chicago exhibit,  the Treasures will be shown at the  New Orleans Museum of Art from  September 15, 1977 to June 1  , 1978.  Then from July l  , 1978 to November  15, 1978 the exhibit can be viewed  at the Seattle Art Museum and finally  from December 15, 1978 to April 15,  1979 it may be seen in the Museum  of Art in New York. Except for its  10 month stay in New Orleans (why  there?) the treasures appear to have  a k month cycle with 1 month allotted  for travel and setting up the exhibit.  The tour of Tutankhairmm began in our  nation's capitol before it came to  Chicago. See it before it leaves  the U.S.A.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page  15   ore per e  INDIANA STATE MEETING  in  National Observance of  International Women's Year  Authorized by the  United States Congress  July 15 and 16, 1977  at the  Indiana Convention Exposition Center  Indianapolis  Cont'd,  from p.  6  All over this country, and the  world, there are people who sincerely believe in the natural inferiority of women. Women themselves to a great and surprising  extent, still believe in it. They  can hardly begin to doubt such assumptions if they have developed no  other latent functions of their natures and have reached middle age, or  later, with no inner resources to  speak of. Naturally, such women are  likely to resent feminists for denying  that biological difference implies  fated inferiority in personal development and achievement. For if the  feminists are right, then they (the  narrow home-keepers) have failed to  fulfil their own potentialities.  If  the feminists are wrong, however, then  the women who have managed (despite  all handicaps) to write, do scholarly  or scientific research, or become creative in countless active ways, are the  ones who have failed to be real women.  Especially if they have not married or  had children, such women are merely  second-rate, imitation men. I am  afraid these deep frustrations and  resentments underlie all other attacks  by women on E R A and the women who  support it, particularly the active  feminists.  But while I have no further explanations to offer about the  stop-  ER A  women, I cannot conclude on  such a sour note. I have suggested  that the women's movement should  clarify its long-range philosophy,  by which I mean, of course, its  philosophy of the bio-psychological  nature of women. Creative dialogue  on this subject, in books and articles, has been going on for a long  time now and will certainly continue: no one is really authoritative on the matter; and even among  the most brilliant and learned  feminists there is a wide range of  theoretical difference   as well as a  fascinating and varied array of recent research data. In my opionion  it is very important for all concerned women to read in this field  as widely and thoughtfully as they  can, and to contribute whatever  they can to discussion groups, and  to the press. For if they are really serious about women's right to  be treated as fully equal, though  female, human beings, then awakened women need to clarify for themselves, and realize more deeply in  thought and life, what this means  to them.  IHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHt  j    2M      the        r   s* iron ng       * *  Board  by PAT HEIDENREICH j  ************************* ******  The naming of this column became a family project.  I wanted a name that wouldn't be confining.   I ruled out   Queen of the House  and  Shot Nerves.   I considered  Super-Mother , but the kids ruled that one out.   Diary of a Mad Housewife  was perfect but Hollywood beat  me.   Depressingly Yours ,   End of the Line  and  Panic  all  sounded too wildly alarming and  Everyday's a Holiday  promised false hope.   Family Footnotes ,   Pandemonium Reigns  and  House of  Hysteria  were all voted down as being icky.  Go mod, I thought   Ripping Off ,   The Swingin' Mama   or  Right On ...   They're all dumb   my family said.   How about 'The Harried Housewife' or 'Perfection, Where  Are You?' my husband suggested, as he eyed the stacked dishes,  the messy house and me.   Bluuuuuuck,  I said.  My teenaged son piped up,   I've got the perfect one for you   'Over the Hill'.    Thanks, kid,   I snorted.  I asked my eleven year old, who was sulking from being yelled at, for his contribution.   Pat Heidenreich, the Meanest Lady On Earth,   he muttered.

You know the ironing board's been lost for years.    I keep telling you, I think it's somewhere under the ironing.'  His remark failed to dampen my spirits.   I was ecstatic.

Florence Howe, editor of  Women's Studies Newsletter,   is currently on a Mellon fellowship at  Wellesley where she is working on a book about  the  myths of coeducation.    (Photo by J. LaFourest)  In seven1 respects a Women's Studies Program is  more difficult to define today than it was eight or  nine years ago, when there were two of them   at  San Diego State University and Cornell.   Those two  programs had a couple of characteristics in common.  They were campus-based, academic programs that  offered courses for credit to undergraduates.   They  had been begun by faculty and students conscious  of the  political  statement inherent in announcing  that a group of courses had become a  program.    Even a glance at the same two programs today  suggests the current complexities.    San Diego's  program thinks of itself as a  department,   and,  in the university's terms, is moving to become one  It is also one of a number of programs that offer a  minor or a certificate/minor to undergraduates.  Cornell's program now offers not only the equally  ubiquitous major, but also a unique minor that  supplements a broad variety of graduate degrees.  Thus the original definition has been augmented  by the presence of graduate programs, and, even  more dramatically, by the rapid emergence of degree-  granting programs.   For the first time this year, more  than half of the 301 Women Studies Programs offer  either minors,   majors, or graduate degrees.  More      about  Jenna  Kelsie  Word has reached WOMANKIND regarding the next  step in the case of Jenna Kelsie.   Jenna is serving a  fifteen to twenty-five year sentence for 2nd degree  murder in the shooting of her ex-husband during his  brutal attack on her after forcing his way into her  car.  Jenna filed a federal writ of habeas corpus in the  U. S. District Court at Evansville.   Along with this  writ she filed a petition to post bond with an affadavit  of support indicating the many people who support her  release.   Jenna's petition appeared on the docket before Judge Hugh Dillon on October 7th.   She asks that  those who wish to help write or call the district clerk's  office in Evansville asking that Judge Dillon set a  hearing date.   If and when a hearing is set, it will  be helpful for as many supporters as possible to attend.  The issue at question is the appearance of a  special  prosecuting attorney  in the case who had a pecuniary  interest in a conviction and who was hired by the deceased's (Jenna's ex-husband) family in order to insure  a conviction.   This prosecutor was not a duly qualified  or elected prosecutor in Warrick County.  Jenna sends her heartfelt thanks for the many kindnesses and support she received during her clemency  hearing and asks that those concerned continue their  support in this next attempt to obtain justice.  Especially to students in degree   granting programs,  a Women's Studies Program says, here is a coherent  body of knowledge that will prepare you to do the  world's work, including scholarly work.   The breadth  and depth of that new body of knowledge are not easily  controllable or even definable.   Degree   granting  programs have begun to shape their courses around disciplines (women's history, for example) or professions  (counseling and therapy) or themes and institutions  (marriage and the family; employment policies and  technology).  Even while qualifying specialists for the working  world, the women's studies curriculum still has the  quality of the eclectic smorgasbord, a sip and a taste  here and there of refreshment sturdy enough to help  students survive in and even right the intellectual  imbalance of a mainstream diet.  In addition to degree-granting and non-degree  granting programs, there are now four consortial  programs: the Claremont Colleges (in southern California); the Five Colleges (in western Massachusetts);  the Graduate Theological Union (in the San Francisco  Bay Area); and the Great Lakes Colleges Association  (in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan).   Another, the  Associated Colleges of the Midwest, is in formation.  FACT SHEET: WOMEN'S STUDIES PROGRAMS  1. There are now 301 women's studies programs on college and university campuses in the  United States.  2. Women's Studies programs can be found in  the District of Columbia and in all but five of the 50  states.   Those states without programs are Alaska,  Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, and Wyoming.  3. The state with the largest number of programs continues to be California.   Other states with  significant numbers of programs include New York,  Illinois, and Michigan.  4. Three-quarters of all women's studies  programs can be found in public colleges and universities; one-quarter on private campuses. More  than half of them are to be found in public four-  year colleges and universities; one-quarter in private four-year colleges and universities.   There  are no programs at private two-year colleges.  5. Slightly more than half (54 percent) of  all programs offer a structured curriculum leading to  the completion of a minor, certificate, or degree.  Six programs (all located in California) offer tne  Associate of Arts degree; 80 programs, the B. A. ;  21 programs, the M. A. ; and 5 (SUNY/Binghamton,  Union Graduate School, Case Western Reserve, University of Northern Colorado, and University of  Iowa), the Ph. D.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Being   Crazy   is   the   Only   Thing  Keeping   Me   Sane  Premiere  benefit  for  Womankind  and  Woman's  Touch  by  Sharon Hatton  November 2   3, 8:00 P.M.  North Methodist Church  38th   Meridian Street  Indianapolis  Woman Shine Productions, Inc.  Tickets  6.00 at the door   5.00 in advance;  Call 317-299-2276 for tickets or  write  Woman's Touch  6352  W.   37th  St.,   Indpls.,   IN  46224  Women's humor is alive and well in WomanShine  Production's new musical, BEING CRAZY IS THE  ONLY THING KEEPING ME SANE.   All the qualities we love in a musical are here: rollicking  humor, interesting characters, memorable music,  rhythmic tap dancing, tender poignancy, and all in  a feminist perspective.   BEING CRAZY celebrates  the strength of women's friendships, especially the  support women give each other in times of crisis.  The comedy/drama covers seven months in the  lives of four women and a twelve year old boy who  live in the same apartment building.   They learn  to cope with divorce, motherhood, love, trust,  careers, and how to make choices.  BEING CRAZY is the second play by Sharon Hatton,  author of PATCHWORK POWER.   The music, composed  by Suzanne Wilson, Nan Sundell, and Kathy Ballard,  is the kind of rich, full music you will want to hear  again and again.  For great music and a good laugh and a good cry,  don't miss BEING CRAZY IS THE ONLY THING  KEEPING ME SANE.  In rehearsal, the cast of BEING CRAZY, etc. poses.

LAWRENCE  On Sunday, August 27, a group of 1, 000 Indianapolis Public School Teachers attended a  crisis rally   and voted overwhelmingly to strike.   The pro-strike  vote was cast by an 85 per cent majority of the  teachers attending the rally; the majority of the group  was composed of female teachers.   There are approximately 3, 800 IPS teachers in. Indianapolis.  IPS had proposed a one percent salary increase for  the school year (only a half percent would be realized in  1979), .and had also proposed: Lengthening the teachers  day, increasing the number of  split classes,     increasing the size of classes, decreasing reimbursement dollars  to teachers for purchases of educational supplies, and  restricting the use of  personal days.  ( Split classes   are those which contain more than one grade level  within thejame classroom.)  Though  6 million in new money came into the system  this year, only about  100, 000 was appropriated for  teacher raises   or approximately  25 per teacher. When  IPS finally released salary appropriation figures, the  budget for teacher's salaries had been cut  80, 000 from  the figure on the previous year's budget.   I feel education is the most important facet of the  human experience,   said one female IPS teacher,   and it's a shame that, as important as it is, it is one  of the lowest-paying professions.   Administrators receive raises, and they don't have to beg for them  either.   Why should we?   Another female teacher stated:  Each year, I see  really good teachers leave the field because of economic necessity.   My husband gave up a teaching  career because he couldn't afford to teach.    This year, as in proceeding years, things look grim  for teachers.   Considering double-diget inflation,  teachers will be at a disadvantage with even a 5 percent salary increase, which was the amount IPS teachers received for the 1978-1979 school year.  The woes of education are not unique to Indianapolis.   On August 26th, the Associated Press reported that teachers in five states were expected to  strike (teachers in sixteen states ultimately did  strike).   To cover the shortage, parents, administrators and substitutes were assigned to supervise the  classes.   There was one documented case of an  eighth-grader  teaching  a second grade class.   In  some areas, the pay rate for substitutes was  100  per day.   (In Indianapolis, the pay rate for substitute  teachers was on occasion nearly double the standard  rate.)  (Photo by Concetta Johnson.)  Is it intentional or merely coincidental that the  teaching profession, like other professions which are  predominately female, usually underpay those who  choose to work in them? How interesting it is that,  in education, 70 percent of teachers are women,  while higher-paying positions     those of administrators,  principals and counselors     are composed primarily of  men (71 percent).  The shortsightedness of those in administrative  positions reflects the incompetency of those dealing  with today's educational needs.   Was a raise of  25  per year, for example, considered a realistic offer  when the budget was formulated in Indianapolis? How  would most individuals -- male or female -- react  to such a proposal?  In addition, administrators also  lack the foresight to predict the outcome of underpaying teachers.   If teachers are forced to settle for one  percent salary increases (or the like) year after year,  what would be the only predictable outcome in attracting quality educators a few years down the road?  Instead of disrupting education every fall, it would  perhaps be best to reassess our wants and needs as a  society once and for all.   Is education important to  us?   If so, it is only reasonable to expect to pay for  it     and pay well -- for the future of ourselves and  our country.   If it is not, we should be content to see  empty classrooms and instructors on picket lines at the  beginning of each school year.  Candy Coated  Philosophy  By MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  Lesson 1.   Parenting.  He was both a springtime delight and an object  lesson in parenting.   He was, briefly, ours to wonder  at, and cheer  on     and finally, to tell goodbye.  We called him Chicken Robin.  In mid-March, when there was still snow in spots,  his parents built their nest atop a pillar inside our open  porch.   It was a bit above eye level from inside our  house, but when I stood tiptoe, I could watch the construction efforts and see the nest take shape.   Surprisingly, once the work was complete, the mature robin  pair abandoned it for several weeks.   We thoughtt  they had thought better of building so close to humans;  but one evening, when we returned from work, we  heard movement atop the pillar.   When we looked up,  we saw that we were being observed by a shiny-eyed,  nervous robin in the nest.  Some days later, we took turns watching through  the window, until both robins had left the nest. We  saw three perfect, tiny eggs, of the color of a May  morning sky, in a shallow padding at the center of the  nest.   The days went quickly: we watched the birds  take turns at the nest (only briefly did the male assume  this chore, presumably when the female needed exercise) and saw the male bring food to his mate, as if  she were a nestling.  There were periods of warm weather, now. When  these occurred, the female robin panted on the nest  We had been told that her body temperature rose dramatically during incubation and she certainly seemed  to feel the temperature changes more than we.    When  we trooped in after work, the father robin frequently  tried his  crippled bird  maneuver, designed to draw  us away from proximity to his nest.   He would run a-  long in front of us, dragging one wing and hopping  stiffly, hoping that we'd follow him.   At times, .when  he saw we weren't impressed, he would offer a little  faint, half-note of song to further call our attention  to his frailty.   He never learned to trust us.  On a Saturday morning,   we opened our door  cautiously,  because the female had acted frightened  the previous evening.   As soon as the door was open,  we could hear the soft chirrupings and twitterings of  newly hatched birds. Until evening, the mother did  not leave the nest; the father fed her and sat on the  maple branch closest to their nest and sang what.  sounded somewhat like his territorial song. At dusk,  the mother flew out to the side yard and our son  stood on the porch rail to look down into the nest and  announce,  They all hatched --we have three new  neighbors    By Sunday noon, we were sure that the parent-  birds would never be able to raise their brood. Three  large, yellow mouths were open wide; three wobbly  little heads turned constantly, searching for the  Bringers of their Food and three little throats sent  forth loud starvation notices.   The parents flew to  and from the nest like shuttle-buses: bringing wads  of worms each trip.   There was no satisfying the  gourmands in the nest; the moment the food was  swallowed, the begging began again. Mercifully,  they fell asleep at dusk.  Monday morning, a cheeping chorus sounded as we  walked up on the porch.   We took advantage of the  moment to look at the new arrivals.   They looked  somewhat like a five-month human fetus, in that the  heads were very large, the eyes huge and the eyelids  and surrounding tissues were tinted slightly purple and  were paper-thin.   The biggest features were, of course  their mouths    It didn't seem possible that so small an  organism should require that gigantic maw   For the rest of the week, we saw the parents working  when we left in the mornings and still working when we  came home.   They brought food to the nest until dark,  now.   The little ones grew very quickly and feathered  out, with little spotted breasts and soft brown backs.  Their heads were still a bit too large for their bodies  and their appetites were gargantuan.  On Sunday, the male robin was killed. Our houses, in  in this pleasant older section of town, are built on   hills  on either side of broad streets, which lie in  little  valleys  between. Father Robin swooped down  over the street on his way to the.opposite  hill    and  was struck down by a passing car. The poor mother had  no time to mourn her mate: she now had double-duty  feeding chores, as well as trying to keep an eye on the  nest at all times, to protect the fledglings from marauders.   We decided that, should the task of caring for the  (Continued to page 11)

LAWRENCE  The Techambuli of New Guinea, the group made famous by the late Margaret Mead, in itself almost dispels  the myths regarding women as we have come to know  them.   In their culture, the total reversal of roles may  confound even the most liberal in our own society.   The  implications of the study by Margaret Mead suggest that  not only are the roles of men and women different than  those of our own, but that the actual temperament of  the individual is molded by the Techambuli society.  First and foremost in the selection of a marriage partner is that every man looks for a woman who will be a  good provider.   If a female does not possess the skills  for fishing and net-making, she is of no use to the  male, who is not predisposed to work because of his  delicate temperament.   The main medium of exchange is the talibun (small, polished green snail  shells), and it is every man's desire that his wife pro-,  vide him with the status the acquisition of talibun can  give him.   It is the female who provides the money,  food, support and affection for the family.  As Mead implies in her book, Sex and Temperament,  published in 1963, the emotional state of the individual  is molded by society.   The Techambuli men are highly  emotional and vain.   They are partial to elaborate hairstyles, which are ornamented with kina shells, and they  also enjoy wearing the latest fashions dictated by the  group.   Their feelings are constantly injured by other  men and quarrels are frequent.   The women bear  shaven heads and are emotionally strong.   They possess  the initiative  and power within the group. The women  do not quarrel.   As Mead explains:   And whereas the lives of the men are one  mass of petty bickering, misunderstanding,  reconciliation, avowals, disclaimers, and  protestations accompanied by gifts, the  lives of women are singularly unclouded  with personalities or with quarreling.  For fifty quarrels among the men, there  is hardly one among the women.   The acquisition of a wife demonstrates the female's   sexual freedom  among the Techambuli.   Often, a  young man will be recalcitrant of his betroth's advances  and is therefore publicly derided for not accepting her.  The reason for this stems from the fact that the young  men are uncertain upon whom a girl's choice may fall  and, because of this, grows distrustful and jealous of the  other men.   Rearrangement of marriage partners occurs  when a man fails to consumate the betrothal or when  a girl is unwilling to have him. Especially it is urgent  to quickly wed a young widow, for the female is more  interested in sexual activities. Because men are not  so urgently sexed or aggressive, they do not mind waiting for a suitable betrothal.  When a marriage actually does take place, women  continue to occupy the center space of the large  community house, while men fringe its edges. After  marriage, men continue to live a bachelor-type life  at the men's dwelling-house. There, they gather their  own firewood, cook their own meals, and live in a  state of nervous discomfort lest their feelings become  hurt by the other men.  Being Crazy is the Only  Thing Keeping  Me Sane  In addition to the labor required to sustain both tne  family unit and the group, the female members of the  Techambuli must also cook the meals and prepare the  foods for the frequent feasts and dances.   The dances  are, in fact, one of the main considerations for the  women to work.    They labor so that the dance may go on.  While they labor, the men will endeavor to learn the  steps to make him a graceful dancer.   They may also  learn to play the flute, which is part of the dance ceremony.   Though the females must prepare the special foods  for the feast in addition to their daily labors, they welcome  every occasion for feasting and dancing as a pause in  their vigorous workdays.  Children are reared nonchalantly. Other women, along  with the child's biological mother, participate in her/his  upbringing.   Offspring are nurtured and there is always  someone near to pick up a child when she/he cries.   Weaning is done  carelessly and casually,   for the women are  apt to stuff delicacies into a child's mouth so she/he won't  cry.   From a young age, the male child begins to depend  on the females of the group for support and, when grown,  will call his wife aiyai, which is the sane name he  calls his mother.    If the Techambuli can be considered interesting in the  reversal of roles as we know them, perhaps the most  chilling experience in the study of cultures was done by  Colin M. Turnbull, who went to Uganda to study the Ik.  So severe are their circumstances that the lives of the Ik  are reduced to the most simple and savage of human  values in order for them to survive. As Turnbull put it:   The Ik teach us that our much vaunted  human values are not inherent in humanity at all, but are associated only  with a particular form of survival called  society, and that all, even society itself, are luxuries that can be dispensed  with   Because of their extreme plight, the family, among  the Ik,  had ceased to exist.    In order to survive,  the  individual is heedless of any responsibility whatsoever  to children, parents, or siblings. The virtual nonexistence of human values in their society has emerged  for want of one elemental need: food.  A child is permitted to live with her/his parents until,  the age of three or four, then is  turned out.  Therefore  adulthood begins at an early age and it is of no concern  to the parents whether or not the child survives.  Until the age of three, the child is resentfully cared  for by his biological mother.  A typical day begins  with the search for food.   When a suitable place is  found, the mother loosens the sling she uses for carrying the baby and drops the child harshly.   She laughs  of course, if it is hurt.   The mother attends to the  business of gathering, the only real  industry  among  the Ik, and the child is left alone.   Often, the  mother will hope that a predator will take the  child.   This did occure during the time Turnbull  lived among the Ik.   Turnbull explains:   This happened once while I was there--once  that I knew of, anyway--and the mother was  delighted.   She was rid of the child and no  longer had to cany it about and feed it, and  Continued to page 11  How fo be a liberated brrfe  Free yourself from a lot of hassles  with our  one-stop bridal shopping  We can help liberate you.

Submitted by Merely Overwrought  India: Dowries  and Death  On June 12, 1979, a demonstration in New Delhi,  India, demanded an end of murder by fire of brides  because of a lack of a proper dowry, or non-payment  of a promised dowry.   At least five young women whose  fathers failed to pay the full bride-price (dowry) after  the weddings, were dowsed with inflammables and set  afire as a result of their father's failure to pay up. Protesters carried placards:  Arrest Tavinder's murderers   and  The death of even one more girl will not be tolerated .   The demonstration was called by New Delhi's  battered women's shelter.   Both men and women participated.  A delegation of five women demanded that  those  found guilty should not be given bail when their guilt  is established.   They also urged the harshest possible  sentences and demanded that the full dowry of any  murdered girl be returned to the parents.  Dowries were outlawed in India in 1961, but the  Dowry Prohibition Act has failed to achieve its  purpose.   Fathers still give dowries  to buy happiness  for their daughters.     Well-to-do grooms can expect  one lakh ( 12, 000).   Business executives, engineers,  and doctors are near the top of the dowry scale.   In  addition,  all men at these economic levels can expect a car, refrigerator and television.   A clerk can  demand a bicycle, transistor and/or wrist watch. A  scooter is a common demand at the middle income  level.  News reports of these tragic events were sent to  Working Feminists by Ellen Jane Franklin of Winnipeg,  Canada, who i3 currently travelling in Asia.  From WORKING FEMINISTS, New York, New York.

Osborn)  Late this summer, the Duke Ellington band led by  the Duke's son, Mercer, appeared in Indianapolis.  The sound -- the usual rich Ellington.   The unusual,  a young woman, Lisa Pollard.  Lisa, a member of the otherwise all male Ellington  band, sat in the front row playing tenor sax, second  seat.   Lisa said she had been with the band six months  this time.   A few years ago when I was just a kid, Duke gave  me a chance, but I got messed up for a while and  didn't have my head straight and sort of dropped out.  Duke later found me and helped me to see what was  really important in my life.   If it weren't for the  Duke I don't know where I'd be today,   said Lisa.   Ya know, the Duke's not really gone, he's right  here with the band every single time we perform,  and Mercer is a beautiful person, too,   she said.   He sees to it that I also get an education even while  traveling with the band   and the music's the best,  the kind I've always wanted to play.    Lisa, whose home is in San Francisco, California,  said that playing with the Ellington band was a  dream  come true.   I liked Lisa Pollard.   She is out there doing exactly  what she wants to be doing and loving every minute of  it.  As our interview ended Lisa said,  If you print this,  please send a copy to my mother so she'll see what  I'm doing and that I'm really all right.   Here she is mom     - and she really is all right.  Doing what she does best, Lisa Pollard with  the Ellington band. (Photo by M. Osborn.)  The    Nestle    Boycott...

Book Review:    The Terrible Thing That Happened  by JUDITH RAE ROGERS  at Our House  MARGIE BLAINE. Parents' Magazine Press, 1975  DOES MOM'S CAREER MEAN FAMILY CHAOS?  Multiple choice question-.  THE TERRIBLE THING THAT  HAPPENED AT OUR HOUSE is a book you will want to  a) Read again and again to your children.  b) Send to your niece and nephew when your sister-  in law gets that terrific job.  c) Recommend to your children's school librarian  for purchase  d) Read yourself when you wonder if your career is  worth the hassle.  e) All of the above.  Answer: e  THE TERRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED AT OUR  HOUSE is a true-to-life story of changes and conflicts  that occur in a little girl's life when her mother returns to teaching.   How the family solves the problems is realistic   and heart-warming.  This book is one of two that I found listed under   Working Mothers  in a branch library's list of problem areas for children.   The librarian suggested the  small number of titles was because  this is no longer  a problem.   It is now acceptable for mothers to work  outside the home.    Employed mothers know this is not true I   When  mothers  go back to work,   there are many changes,  problems, frustrations, and even calamities.   Perhaps  because  of our guilty consciences, we try to rationalize, to justify,  and to deny that problems exist.  But we must face the truth:  There are dilemmas for  the family when Mom leaves the role of full time  homemaker to go into the working world.   THE  TERRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED AT OUR HOUSE  presents a realistic view of this situation.  By reading this story in which fictitious children  face many of the same difficulties the child must  face daily,  the family can better cope with real life  predicaments.   This is a  picture  book that can be enjoyed by children and adults of all ages.  The nameless little girl who is the main character  plunges right into the plot by beginning her narrative:   My mother used to be a real mother.     She says her  mother used to do common, ordinary things like say  good-bye as she and her brother left for school, have  an after school snack ready when they got home, take  them to the park, etc.  How things change after her mother returns to teaching are presented in humorous exaggeration through the  child's words and the imaginative illustrations.  The graphic art illuminates and elaborates the text.  Just as the plot is realistic, the illustrations are also.  The messes shown in the kitchen, the school lunch  room, the child's bedroom, etc. are familiar     quite similar to what the reader sees at home, school,  and at a neighbor's . The climax of the story is  reached logically'.  Then, one night at dinner, when my brother kept  talking and talking, and no one was really listening to him or even heard me when I asked for  some more milk, I got mad.   I got so mad I  started yelling.  Halloween     Night   Benefit     For  The     Women's     Information  Network  Halloween night at Labyris, 631 E. Michigan Street  Indianapolis,  Indiana  The night is called THE WITCHING HOUR and  will benefit the Women's Information Network (WIN)  -- the group that handles the women's switchboard  among other things.  The door cover charge will go to WIN.   The cover  will be  2. for everyone in costume and  5. for women without costumes    There are all kinds of things  planned for the evening: three shows, dunking for  apples and other Halloween tricks, plus prizes for  costumes--the most original, most feminine, best  witch, most comical, most flamboyant, best  herstorical, etc.  Join in for lots of fun and help WIN at the same time.     NO ONE CARES ANYMORE IN THIS HOUSE.  NO ONE LISTENS.   NO ONE HELPS YOU.  NO ONE EVEN PASSES THE MILK WHEN YOU  NEED IT '  Everyone stopped talking and looked at me.  My mother said, 'Oh, you poor thing,' and  came and put her arms around me.  My father said, 'What's bothering you, sweetheart?'  And my brother passed me the milk.  Marge Blaine's style has fresh originality,and the  characters are real as they grow internally throughout the story.  THE TERRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED AT OUR  HOUSE conveys its message powerfully yet simply.  The reader feels an emotional impact with the child's  words  I always thought taking care of us was pretty  important. . .    This book is more than an entertaining story to read  to your children. I feel it is significant for three reasons.  1. The book puts into words the too often unexpressed feelings of children.  2. The book aids communication between parent  and child.   As a mother reads to her child, there can  be discussion of their own family's problems.    Do  you ever feel this way?  Do you ever wish I didn't  have a job? Do you resent having to do so much work  around the house?  Do you miss me sometimes ?   3. The book shows that every problem has many  possible solutions. And everybody can contribute to  the resolution of the problem:   My brother and I said we could fold the laundry  so my father would have time to read us a story.  The socks don't always come out right, but  we're getting better.   The story concludes realistically, not with assurance  of happiness-ever-after, but with the feeling that this  family will somehow be able to conquer all of the  difficulties that will inevitably occur.   The little girl  ends the story with these words:   Things aren't so terrible at our house anymore.  I guess they're a real mother and father after all.    EDITOR'S note:  There are five copies of this book available at the  Indianapolis Central Library, and most Indianapolis  branches have it.   The author of this review found  the book in an American school's library while she  was living in South America.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  rtipi  0NU  BOARD  It Helps to Ignore It  By PAT HEIDENREICH   How would you like a cup of nice hot coffee?   I asked Roquespiere, the other night from my position on the couch.   I'd love one,   he smiled.   When you get yours, bring me one, O. K. ?  I replied as I stretched out.  This is just one of the little energy saving tricks  I've learned over the years.   There are, in fact,  many  things the procrastinating housewife can employ.  For example, when the inside of the refrigerator  gets to the point that it makes you sick to look at it,  simply close your eyes and go by feel.   With a little  practice,  it's easy to pick out the  milk and the eggs.  The mayonnaise and ketchup bottles also have a distinctive shape .   Of course,  you do run the risk of  accidentally sticking your hand into some leftover  casserole or other, but all in all,  the chance is worth  it.   Our closet is a darn mess,   Roquespiere complained  the other morning as he tripped on the box of gift wrapping paper on the floor and fell out of the closet clutching a semi-wrinkled shirt.   What mess?  I mumbled innocently from the bed,  pulling the covers up over my head.  I didn't see any  mess.     I'm glad you don't let the house get you down,   he  said rather sarcastically.   I know,   I said from under the covers.    If I didn't  control myself, I'd turn into a regular housecleaning  drudge.    After all,   I continued, exposing my eyes co-  quettishly,   which would you rather come home to,  a tired wife passed out from exhaustion on the spotless living room floor, or a relaxed, well-read woman  ready for fun and games?    Do I have a choice?    Of course you do,   I said, trying to find my slippers  under the bed.     Just because we've shared 18 long years,  given birth to four children, gone through the chicken  pox,  P. T. A. and Science Fair days together,  doesn't  mean you can't change partners if you want to.    His face brightened.   I bet you'd pick one of those house-cleaning nuts,    I said disgustedly as I automatically closed my eyes and  felt around in the closet for my robe.    One of those  Mrs. Olsen types, with her hair in a bun and a little  apron tied neatly over her housedress.   One who never  takes short-cuts in her baking and keeps a perfect house.   He looked dreamy eyed.   O.K. darn it,   I conceded.   I WAS planning to spend  the day beautifying my body and reading 'Make Your  Marriage a Love Affair' in this month's Reader's Digest,  but if you'd rather, I'll clean the lousy refrigerator.    As soon as the words left my mouth, I realized  my mistake.   Don't ever make rash, stupid statements  in the heat of a conversation.   It could cause you to  lose a whole day on the couch.  Dancer  Fulfills  Goals  by GWEN DIEHN  Mary Stuart Van Mele radiates happiness and  energy.   (Photo by J. LaFourest)  At the age of twelve, Mary Stuart Van Mele made  a choice between becoming a nun and being a ballet  dancer. Although ballet won, fifteen years later she  united both aspirations by forming a liturgical dance  troup,  Mary studied dance as a child.   At age seventeen  she was dancing with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.  At eighteen she danced with Jose Greco and at nineteen began studies in music theory at Butler University,  from which she holds a degree.   Having performed in  nightclubs and done some touring, she decided that  an independent womens newsjournal  women in struggle  politics, health, work, prison  news coverage and political analysis  on the issues that affect womens lives  contributing sub  12 or more  one year sub  6    sample copy 60c  foreign  13    Canada  7  business and institutions  20  oob, 1724 20th st. nw,  wash, dc 20009  I BELIEVE IN  WOMANKIND  AND I HELPED PAY FOR  THIS AD   Deborah Counts  Carol Hegland  Anne Wilcox  Deborah Grider  Martha Esther Eubanks  Loreta Riffel  Jane Tilford  Joanne McQueen  Lynn Rogers  If you believe in Womankind, send  1 or more  and we will include your name in our next  issue's I BELIEVE IN WOMANKIND ad.

She saw  dance as a mission, as her way of relating to human  needs.  Mary, who describes herself as a devout feminist  and a devout Christian, was raised an Episcopalian  in Holland, Michigan.   Her strong religious feelings  found a vehicle for expression in dance when, while  studying at Butler, she conceived the idea of forming  a liturgical dance troupe which would dance not in  the church hall, but at the altar as part of worship  services.   After encountering a great deal of resistance  from clergymen, Mary's troupe finally danced for a  worship service at St. James Episcopal Church in  South Bend, Indiana.   The troupe continues to dance  in worship services at churches in the area.  Several years ago, when Mary learned through a  friend of the extremely poor conditions at Indiana  Women's Prison, she again used dance as her ministry.  She developed a dance therapy program at the prison  (with herself as unpaid therapist) and the success of  that led her to enlarge the program so that it now  includes gardening, softball, and disco dancing.  Mary has performed in Indianapolis at The Woman's  Touch at one of the monthly Sistercelebrations held  there.  Currently Mary is studying for the ordained ministry at Seabury Western Episcopal Seminary in Evans-  ton, Illinois.  She believes firmly that the body is a direct visual  manifestation of the spirit.   She is a runner who runs  three to five miles a day (and recently won a first  place in the Michiana Long Run).   She heads her own  belly dance troupe and teaches dance and yoga at the  local YWCA.   She has also taught a TV exercise program.  Mary's motto seems to me to sum up the way in  which she lives her life:    I have lived to know that  the secret of happiness is never to let your energies  stagnate.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Craft Skills Survive Throughout Herstory  by JUDITH RAE ROGERS  The eleven other women in the wheat weaving  class are busily following the instructor's directions  as I get more and more confused   Add a piece of wheat on the right by going under  the first, over the second. Now, add a piece on the  left, again going under the first and over the second.    Wait  Left? Right? First? Second?  Not so fast...   ... To lock these, pick up the second on the right  and cross over the outside one to the opposite side.  Repeat on the left side    I feel like making shredded wheat of my tangled  mess    Add a new piece on the right. Go under the outside piece and over the inside ones. Do the same on  the left.   Lock in place as before.    But I didn't lock before  How will I ever catch up  with her directions?   Here, I'll show you,   the person to my left volunteers.  It's hard to get started, but it's easy once you  get going.   She put her creation down and patiently explained  the directions to me.   After three more tries, I too  was weaving   I felt grateful to this stranger.    She help me despite the risk of getting behind in the directions.  She was not the only helpful person in the class.  Throughout the two hours, the participants constantly  showed, explained,  held, cut, tied, watered,  suggested, and encouraged.   To me, this camaraderie  was the best part of the Indianapolis Children's Museum's  Seminar.   This camaraderie was more important than the  the acquisition of new skills, than the sense of accomplishment we felt, than the finished hand-made products  we took home with us.  Last winter, fifty-nine members of the Children's  Museum attended this seventh annual Skills Seminar.  Craftworkers enthusiastically participated in classes  in thread pulling,  quilting, stenciling, wheat weaving, tole painting, calligraphy,   and emphasis was on  learning by doing.  Though some of the novices began the classes with  hesitancy, tangled fingers, and remarks of  I'm no  artist,   they left with feelings of self-satisfaction and  proficiency.  Most of the teachers learned their speciality by trial  and error while following directions in books or magazines.   Others learned from workshops.   The crafts-  women emphasized that experience helped perfect  their techniques and according to the instructors, an  art background is not required.   The desire to learn  is more important.  As we concentrated on our projects, we talked  freely and enjoyed the fellowship of our new acquaintances.  During lunch, I sat next to someone who has  read many of my favorite books.   It was a delightful surprise to feel an immediate bond to  this stranger.   After a quick discussion of many  feminist issues, we exchanged phone numbers before we hurried to our afternoon classes.  Many people asked  Where did these crafts begin?   Answers stressed  centuries ago...,    unknown,     No one knows....    I was reminded of the graffiti   Anonymous was a woman.    Respect and recognition is now being given to  needlework and crafts that women have been producing throughout herstory.   Though they received  little or no acknowledgement or credit, they kept  these skills alive, creating art with whatever materials they could find.   They taught themselves and  others.  The Skills Seminar is an annual January event at the  Indianapolis Children's Museum. This museum is  financially supported mainly by corporate and individual  donations and membership fees. The Skills Seminar is  sponsored by the Children's Museum Guild as a service  to the community and not as a money-making project.  The Guild, whose purpose is to serve the museum, is a  volunteer organization of Indianapolis-area women.  Membership in the Children's Museum entitles  members to many other benefits beside workshops like  the Skills Seminar.   Though most of the programs are  geared to children,  adults also enjoy the museum.  Admission is free, and many programs are open to the  public.  There are four membership plans available, ranging  from the  10 individual membership to the  50. a year   Discovery Club.

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  Are Women Better than Men?  There is an old argument that flares up periodically  within the contemporary women's movement and reverberates from the halls of academe to the kitchen table  of the average family.   Simply put, it asks: Are women  better than men?   Better  in this case means not stronger or smarter,  but more moral, more humane.  The suffrage movement made one of its central  themes the inherent civilizing qualities of the female  of the species.   Women's votes, it was promised,  would bulge the ballot boxes with demands for peace  and social harmony.   The idea of women's natural  superiority has continued to germinate in the minds  of women in the ensuing decades.  And it's not surprising that it should persist, for '  there is, after all, much in the common experiences  of women to suggest such superiority.  The intense devotion to children, the sensitivity to  feelings, the dislike of violence or cruelty, the ability to endure in the face of hardship and suffering.  So many qualities ---so often ignored by the larger  society     qualities that women know are an essential social glue.  Yet the very persistence of this idea seems to me  more a mark of oppression than of liberation.  It is not so much a justification as a consolation     part of a feminine mythology handed down over back  fences and front porches, passed on across clothes  lines and in laundromats.   It is the small lie we tell  ourselves to counter the big lie of female inferiority  that society has told us.   It is the complicity of outcasts     a pact made with each other when we cannot bear to face the cold reality of our social ostracism.  It has been surprising to me, therefore, that parts of  the women's liberation movement have attempted to  elevate this notion to the level of theoretical principle.  Time and again I have encountered in writings,  speeches, or conversations the assertion that male  values are at the root of all evil in the world.  by ROBERTA LYNCH  Women haven't been the ones to start wars, or  eat away at the environment, or dream up bombs  that can blow away a whole corner of the earth, or  ... and so the argument goes.   Ihe catalogue of  history's horrors is a lengthy one and if you want to  assume that because men have been the dominant sex  through it all, they have responsibility for it all, then  the case certainly seems airtight.  But this line of logic has always struck me as dangerous.   Because if we give men all the blame, then we  must also give them all the credit.   For history is not  simply a record of outrages.   It is a complex journey  from primitive conditions of existence to advance  technology and highly developed ideological and  social systems.   It includes great human triumphs  over natural disasters, barbaric impulses, and social  adversity.  And in my view, women were not just passive .  observers of this historical drama.   They were important,  albeit unrecognized, actors.   And, as such, they have r  at least partial responsibility for both the evil and  the good that have been done in the name of  mankind.    Frorm this standpoint, it is impossible to simply  accept wholesale the strain of feminist analysis that  condemns all things  male  and enshrines the  female  as political principle.  There are many traits more common to women that  have been devalued because of male dominance     and our society is seriously damaged as a result. There  is little doubt that the kind of caring and nurturance  that women have developed over the centuries would  help to profoundly transform political and social relations,  could they be brought into the mainstream of  social life.  But women are not simply saints.   There are some   female  characteristics that are much better left on  the sidelines of society, shed like an old skin as we  lumber clumsily into new roles.   And, conversely, de-  despite the obvious and obnoxious political and personal  flaws of men, everything male cannot just be labelled   bad .  Good    News    About     the     Susan     B.  Released for circulation on  July 2, the Anthony dollar coin is  expected to  generate significant  savings  in the cost of producing  U. S. currency, according to  Director of the Mint, Stella  Hackel.   The coin costs less to  produce than either dollar bills  or other dollar coins.  The Anthony dollar is sized  between the quarter and half  dollar and weighs one-third as  much as four quarters. When  compared with the larger  Eisenhower dollar, the new coin  already is saving the Treasury  Department 60 percent of the  cost of minting.  As the new coin replaces use  of the dollar note, the Federal  Reserve System projects an annual  savings of  50 million due to re -  duced costs for printing new bills,  for handling bills, and for destroying old bills.  The size and weight of the  Anthony dollar are expected to  make it easy and convenient to use.  In addition, the coin should reduce  errors and save time at cash registers, reduce bank teller transaction  time and make counterfeiting more  difficult.  Circulate the Susan B. coin. It's  good business.  155  rs.  a  I suspect that these  male  and  female  traits  are not inherent, but learned (even if this learning  has taken place over the generations) and that there  are aspects of each that are positive and desirable.  We are, each sex, malformed, locked as we have  been within our own gender identities.   We are really  groping our way through history: the men, blind, lacking a certain vision into the human heart; the women,  crippled, unable to stand free in the world.  I do not mean by this to be unduly   pessimistic  about our collective prospects.   But I do want to  insist that we must look not just at the political  evil of sexism, but at its human consequences, not  just at the way it limits our choices, but at the way  it limits our humanity.  Nor do I mean to suggest that there is an equality  of victimization.   Men, after all, have the pleasures  of their power.   While women are finding it increasingly impossible to find happiness in their bondage.  The result is that our current sexual battles are  necessary not because women are naturally better  and should themselves become dominant, but because the positive   female  qualities have been  excluded from social legitimacy,   while the  male   traits have too often been aggrandized or exagerrated.  And if it seems   as it does to me   that women  are moving much more rapidly toward making necessary changes than men, it is not because we are  better individuals, but because the social forces acting on us allow little choice.   We are more and more  in the world and our survival requires our growth.  For now, this lopsided social and personal change  is producing both exhilaration and confusion.   We  are only beginning to grasp how entrenched our roles  are, how difficult a real transformation will be.   At  times, we seem to be doing nothing less than climb-  straight up the side of a very steep cliff. But we have  embarked, and perhaps in the end we will all, men  and women, be  better  for it.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  CANDY (Continued from page 3)  little robins be too great for her, we would dig night-  crawlers and put them on the wide porch rail in hope  she could use them.   We shouldn't have doubted her  ability, though; she kept them fed for the next several  days, alone.  On Thursday, it was obvious that the mother robin was  hastening her babies' departure from the nest. She would  coax a baby to the rim of the nest with a wadded worm  draped from her beak; then, when the baby reached, die  would attempt to push it off balance. When we arrived  home Friday, one baby had flown. Saturday afternoon,  the parent dislodged the second baby's foothold and we  watched it flutter down to the wide porch rail. Later  that day, I watched a baby robin flutter-fly from our  yard to the lowest branch of our maple tree.  Now, the mother had only one reluctant boarder in  the nest.   How she tried to make this last one independent  and how firmly he resisted  When she attempted  to dislodge him, he withdrew to the exact center of  the nest.   When she called, he flattened himself into  the nest, where always before, he and his siblings had  craned their necks in answer to her call.   Now, the  mother refrained from feeding him, this one we  dubbed  Chicken Robin.     When his voice became  hoarse from pleading, she relented, and brought  food.   That night, for the last time, she slept on the  nest.  Sunday dawned grey and cool and cheerless.   No  beautiful robin graced Dur porch that morning  By  around ten o'clock, the noise from the nest died to  a pitiful murmur.   As we watched, a timorous robin  face arose from mid-nest, and a shaky robin body  emerged.   He seemed to be standing on his toes,  craning his neck to seek out the bringer of his food.  From the maple tree, there was an exploding flash of  feathers  The female parent had been patiently waiting this strategic moment    She flew directly into her  recalcitrant offspring, literally ripping loose his clutch  on the nest.   Chicken Robin fluttered down to the cold,  damp cement porch floor, calling for help.   His  mother, after teetering on the nest rim for a last look,  flew down beside her timid offspring and walked to the  steps, trying to lead him to greener pastures. But cold  and wet and grey as it was, the porch was familiar  territory and he would not leave.  Then Mother Robin, who had been so brave and  caring for the past weeks, did the bravest and most  caring thing any parent can do: she stroked the little  one's wing-tops with her beak and then she flew away,  never to return.    Chicken Robin spent a cold,  hungry  night on our porch.   When we came home Monday  evening, he was gone.   He had attained his robin-  hood because his mother had refused to let him remain  a fledgling.   There's a great lesson, there.

CENTURY PERSONNEL  3737 NORTH MERIDIAN ST.  INDIANAPOLIS. IN 46208  VDUH CREDIT RIGHTS  11.  WOMEN (Continued from page 4)  You have the right to:  Receive credit in your own name if you  meet the creditor's standards.  Use a co-signer who is someone other  than your husband, if one is needed.  Refuse to answer questions about your  plans for having or raising children.  Keep your own accounts after marriage,  divorce or widowhood as long as you  meet the creditor's criteria.  Have public assistance, alimony, pension and child support considered as any  other income.  Know the specific reason your application for credit was turned down.  Present information to the creditor which  shows that your husband's credit rating if  it is bad, doesn't reflect your willingness  or ability to pay.  Know what information the credit bureau  has in your credit file.  Have a record at the credit bureau in  your own name for accounts you share  with your husband.  Demand that any incorrect information  in your file be changed.  Have your side of the story placed in your  credit bureau file if unfavorable information cannot be eliminated.  still further this meant that a leopard was in the  vicinity and would be sleeping off the child  and thus be an easy kill. The men set ott  and found the leopard, which had consumed  all of the child except part of the skull;  they killed the leopard and cooked it and  ate it...   If the child survives until the age of three or four and the  Icien custom of  putting them out,   they learn at an  early age--especially girls--the use of the body in order  to survive.    At the age of eight, young girls realize the  selling of her body can be done for food, which translates  as survival.  The husbands in Icien society do not feel responsible for  the keep of their wives or children.   If a man gathers more  food than he can eat, he will probably sell it without his  wife ever getting a bite.   Children, likewise, will take care  to eat their food away from their parents or their age bands,  even if parents and friends are starving.   Feeding an older  member of the society, a  senior citizen,   is regarded  as wasteful.  When cooperation in the work effort does occur, which  is not often, the women basically gather edibles or set  traps for small animals.    The men are responsible for the  hunting activities.   Because, in part, of the scarcity of  food, the women's contribution of vegetable matter is an  exceedingly important factor in the pursuit of survival, as  it is often the bulk of the food intake.  There is little need for other  gainful activity, '* other  than stealing.   One female was reported by Turnbull to  have had a trade -- as a potter -- but her husband left  her when the Ik no longer had a need to buy her pots  and she was therefore no longer able to support her  spouse.  (to be continued in Issue 12)  A recent study entitled  Women's Place in Everyday Talk  has disproved the commonly held stigma  of the talkative female. Conducted by two associates  of the University of California, the study found that  in male/female conversations 96   of all interruptions were made by men. The study also analyzed  the patterns of male/female conversations and concluded that females showed a greater tendency towards silence.  NEED   HELP   WITH  YOUR  MANUSCRIPT?

However, I did take exception  to your movie reviewer's assessment of Norma Rae.  The real-life controversey of Crystal Lee Jordan was  not mentioned, and it is now receiving so much media  attention (Ms.,   60 Minutes,   etc.) that it is impossible to consider the film separately from the person  on whom it was based.   Her real union activities have  been heroic, a point that was made secondary and  watered down in the film.   An embarrassing sex life  was invented to spice up the movie, and Crystal Lee  is suing.   She has endured much humiliation and lies.  She did not give her permission for release of the film,  and so she was paid nothing.   While Sally Field, Ron  Liebman, and Martin Ritt made millions on it, Crystal  is working as a motel maid.   And as you know, the  union has not succeeded at J. P. Stevens (the real mill  of the story), and the consumer boycott is still on.   In  the movie, the union  won        a Hollywood happy  ending?  I have corresponded with Crystal and talked with her  on the phone because of our new post card depicting her,  so I do not feel arbitrary or uninformed about protesting  the movie review.   She is a marvellous, brave, working  class woman, and I hope she succeeds in teaching the  movie moguls and J. P. Stevens a lesson.

        <pagetext>W0MANKB  )  73-year-old Earning Degree  Photo courtesy of THE SAGAMORE  Every Tuesday and Thursday Denzil Stahl gets up  at 6 a.m. to  fix Herman's lunch  before setting off  for the Indiana University-Purdue University at  Indianapolis campus.  Denzil is 73 - years-old but that doesn't stop her  from going to college.   The hour and a half drive  from her farm home near Westfield,- Indiana doesn't  deter her either   It keeps me in shape,   says the white-haired  grandmother of nine who went to Weight Watchers  to prepare for the rigorous schedule.  Denzil, a junior majoring in English Literature,  explains that her return to school in the fall of  1965 wasn't a sudden decision but one she had  planned for many years.  As a young woman just out of Sheridan High School,  Denzil attended college at Depauw University in Green  Greencastle, Indiana.   That was in 1926.   She had  been interested in music for many years, having  played trie piano and clarinet since the eighth grade,  so she decided on a musical career.   Her course of  study was a double major in music education and  clarinet.  by  SHIRLEY  COUTS  However, two years later Denzil left Depauw to  marry her high school beau.   For the next 50 years  she kept house and taught her three daughters the value  of a college education.   My belief in education started with my mother,    she says.  Both of my parents were good students in  high school but neither of them were able to go to  college. They worked real hard to give me the opportunity to go. Mother always said that people  should read, and I have always felt that reading was  very important because of that.   I remember that mother told me people who don't  read won't be anything but vegetables.   I'm very goal  oriented because of her teaching.   If I hadn't had these  goals, I would have been going around in circles. '   I always intended to go back to college,   she says.  As soon as her daughters had established careers or  families of their own. Denzil began to prepare for the  return to school.   I had kept up by taking some continuing education  classes throughout the years,   she recalls.  Her serious return to college would mean even more  preparation. Knowing that her health would be a major  consideration, she joined the weight club and dropped  20 pounds. The next step was courses in speed reading  and in study techniques. Then she made course plans  with a counselor who advised the grandmother to move  at a comfortable pace.  Although she has nine grandchildren of her own  --some of them in college   Denzil doesn't feel out  of place with the younger students.   I think that we learn so much from each other,    she says.    I enjoy the friendships that I have here.    There is one thing that bothers her though--her  long-time dream to teach school will probably  never be fulfilled.   I don't think anyone would hire a 73 year -old  teacher,   she says sadlv.   Even though that dream  may never be attained, Denzil isn't sorry she has  come back to school after all these years.    I  don't downgrade housework but I know I needed,  more than that for myself.   I guess I would be considered a senior citizen     because of my age--but I've always felt that being  old was a matter of mental attitude.

Hearing  a name, we remember the face that goes with it.  Seeing a face, we suddenly recall the name we  haven't heard in 20 years.  Without names, all individuals   Eleanor of Aqui-  taine, Julius Caesar, Susan B. Anthony, George  Washington--would be erased from history. Changes  in those names would bring total confusion: Susan  B. Jones?  George Anderson?  Yet what is the first change a woman usually makes  upon marriage? Before the cake is cut or the champagne is poured, she loses her family name and, hence,  her identity, to become Mrs. Husband's Name.  The loss of identity that often results from marriage  is not merely symbolic; it is all too real.   It is frighten-  ingly easy to lose track of a woman.   One woman's  class reunion committee, tracking people down, sent  her a letter (addressed to Mrs. Husband's Name) inquiring about the whereabouts of several people     including herself.  Many women under age 30 have had 5 or 6 surnames.  Often women who have been married twice will use  both husbands' names (Mary Smith Doe) so they will  be recognized by friends who knew them in the first  marriage. It is easy for a woman to have a business  conversation on the phone with an old high school  friend without either one realizing that they know  each other.  Confusion, loss of identity, and social patterns of  namechanging marriages have demonstrated that the  question of name is vital to the struggle for women's  equality. Like the slaves who changed their surnames  with each change of ownership.   Women can never be  full human beings while breaking off from their past  with each change of marital status.   The record of  women's achievements will remain fragmented if  women's identity cannot remain stable.  We seem to believe that each marriage makes a  woman a new person, her identity being defined by  the relationships she enters, rather than by her actions  and accomplishments.  However personally liberated and independent she  may feel, a woman using her husband's surname is  seen as an extension of him, with her actions attributable to him.   Before resuming my birth name,  I taught French in a high school in which my husband  taught music.   I organized a vacation-time trip to  France for my students, guided them through Paris,  and dealt with all contingencies.   My husband went  along for the ride.   On our return, most local publicity said that the students were accompanied by Mr.  and Mrs. Husband's Name.   The exception: one article  said that the group was led by Husband, music teacher  at X High School, and his wife.  Continued to Page 4  Windfall Profits  Tax   Women  The U. S. House of Representatives has passed a windfall profits tax.   The National Citizens Coalition for  the Windfall Profits Tax encourages all Americans to  write to their senators ( c/o U, S, Senate, Washington,  D. C. 20510) demanding that they take similar action.  Without the passage of this tax on the  windfall  profits  of oil companies, the coalition points out that  among the hardest hit will be women   especially  single women supporting themselves on inadequate  wages and those who are the sole support of their  families.  The coalition notes the Windfall Profits tax can  benefit women in three ways:  1.   FUEL ASSISTANCE  Part of this money will be distributed to the  4.2 million Supplemental Security Income  recipients   65 percent of whom are women     and part to the 3.5 million households receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children    and fully 80 percent of these households  are headed by women.  2. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION  Money from the tax will be used to upgrade  and expand subway and bus services. Did you  know that more than half the public transit  riders are women?  3. ALTERNATE ENERGY SOURCES  The gasoline lines and the prospect of home  heating oil shortages make it obvious that we  must develop alternative sources of energy to  meet our future energy needs. The windfall  profits tax revenues will be used for this purpose, too.  Please write your Senators today   J..R-

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Rape: A Woman's Story  by MICHELLE HUNTER  This is a true story. The author's name, and the state where the rape occurred have been changed.  The author states:  the profile of the rapist is accurate; however, he is a composite of several people.  She continues:  I read Henri Means' A Case of Rape in Issue 8-it was devastating and while looking through  my papers, I came across this piece which I had written sometime after I was attacked. I wrote about it to  get it out of my system.    3.  t*j  2     Gr  THE SETTING  It is a quiet November morning.   Rush hour traffic  has long since departed from southeast Seattle; all  who had to be at work early have reached their  destination.   Children that pass the house on the way  to school are gone now - their laughter and special  sounds will not be heard again until lunchtime or  later in the day when they return from school.   A  light breeze picks up some fallen leaves in the yard.  Leaves and breeze dance a bit in the autumn morning.   In moments, the breeze too, moves on.   It is  Tuesday.  PARTICIPANTS  He is a young man in his late twenties.   His hair is  dark and his eyes almost black.   He has awakened  early this morning and wonders briefly why he is not  tired.   He had been drinking the night before and was  up quite late.   He lies in bed for a few minutes and  looks at the sun coming through the window.   He  thinks about going someplace; about getting up to  go to work, but he has no job.   He sits up and suddenly picks up a pillow and throws it across the  room.   He gets dressed mindlessly - he has someplace to go, but he is not sure where.  He leaves his room and carefully locks the door. His  sister is downstairs in the kitchen cooking breakfast for  her family.   She moves slowly in the small kitchen;  picks up an empty bottle from the table and takes it to  the trash.   She reads the label as she moves and is  suddenly caught in the sunlight.   The shape of her pregnancy seems ludicrous to him. He looks away in disgust.  When she realizes that he has been watching her, she  quickly puts the bottle in the trash and busies herself in  the kitchen.   She speaks to him, but he doesn't answer,  he is gone.  He looks at his watch.   It is nearly eight as he gets  into his car.    His car he takes such good care of  it.   He rubs his hand across the dashboard    clean, how  clean he keeps it.   Oh, he is proud of the car, even  though it isn't new.   He spends time with it to see that  it is always in good condition.   His friends like to ride  in it, but he is the only one that works on it.   He is  almost finished making the payments and soon it will  really be his.   But how will he do it now that he had  lost his job? His anger surfaces as he thinks about it  and he would like to hit something - but not the car.  Instead, he turns the key in the ignition and slowly  drives away from the house.   His thoughts seem just  under the surface of his skull.   He is going someplace,  but he has no idea where.   It is Tuesday.  The woman is home for the day.   She has planned  this day with care - secretly enjoying the planning -  knowing it is nearly as precious as the work she will  do.   Her work for her classes is up-to-date, her regular job is finished until Thursday; household tasks are  pushed into the background for this day.   She has been  awake since six a. m. preparing for it.   Her youngest  child left for school before eight and she is quite free.  She plans to work on her jewelry designs for an upcoming show.   Between her job, her son and her  classes, there is always too little time for creativity.  Today is here and she is happy.  Before she sits down to work, she turns on the  radio - - a Bach toccata -- how lovely to work  while that is playing.   She lets the dog out into  the back yard and watches a small breeze blowing the leaves.   She thinks of autumn, her favorite season and muses idly about renewal, beginnings,  and growth.    I am so fortunate,   she says to nobody  in particular.  She is nearly forty with dark hair and eyes.   She  has raised three children, has gone back to school  and works part-time doing research.   She designs  jewelry for several local shops and is thinking  about taking another part-time job - wondering how  she can fit it into her schedule.   She takes the dog  outside and walks back into the house knowing  nothing will take away from her creative time;  not today.   She sits down to work.   It is after  eight and it is Tuesday.  THE INCIDENT   I didn't hear him - I didn't see him; I had no idea  how long he had been standing in the room.   I had  been half-listening to the music and concentrating  on the small motor tool I was using to polish a ring.  I think I must space out a lot when I am working;  I'm in another world with my mind and hands - too  centered to be much aware of anything else.     Turn around and don't make any noise,   he said.  I started to scream and I heard myself, as if I was someone else.   I couldn't move.   He put his hand over my  mouth; his arm around my neck.   I was trying to scream  and was thinking - I have to get up.   I couldn't believe I was fighting sitting down - I had to get up.  He was saying something - I don't know what.   The  world was spinning and I was trying to bite his finger  - his hand - anything.   Suddenly, he took his arm  away from my neck.   Everything stopped momentarily.   He said,  I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you.   He said it over and over and over again.   I thought,   Oh, God, where is the dog?     Get out of my house  - get out. ..     I started to scream again, and to this  day I do not remember how or when I finally got out  of the chair and stood up.   I moved towards him, and  he momentarily backed away.    I won't hurt you; don't  scream.    My foot went up to kick him and he grabbed  me again.   He twisted my arm and I could no longer  hold the motor in my hand.   I heard it drop to the  floor.   He had something in his hand - a small  object; I saw it flash.   We fought back and forth in  the space of the workshop.   I could hear things falling as  we banged into the workbench first, and the  desk and the wall.   He was very strong and he hurt me  although I didn't know how badly I was hurt and  bruised until much later.   The object in his hand  briefly caught the sunlight - it was a knife.    I  won't hurt you... don't scream.    He was stronger,  much stronger than I.   It was over in moments.  It was not a sex act - it was an act of pure violence  he perpetuated upon me.   His penis was a gun or a  knife or a club and he used it as a weapon.   It was  the same as if he had used the knife in his hand.   It  was the violence I would equate with being hit by  somebody - something that came at me in the dark.  It was not a human act.   I was not a woman to him;  he was not a man or even an animal.  It was finished, but he stayed.   He talked to me  about his sister and his car and the  ob he no longer  had.   I think I told him to get out - maybe no words  came out,   but my mouth moved.    He stayed and  talked. He was very calm as he spoke,  but he seemed  to me to be very far away.   I had trouble focusing  with my eyes - listening to what he was saying with  my ears.   He got very angry for a moment and I  thought he would hit me again, but he stood up suddenly telling me not to move.   In a moment, he  was gone.   I suppose he left as he had entered -  through a window.   I was bruised and wounded and  numb.   I was not dead.  COPING  I am not a stupid person.   Two years ago, I researched a study about mentally retarded women  and girls and rape.   I presented an in-service session  on the subject.   I have read a lot on the subject and  talked with Susan Brownmiller when she was in  (Seattle) I had even worked in a program that was  formed to help women who have been attacked.  Oh, but I am stupid I thought as I stepped into the  shower with my clothes on.   I mustn't do this. I  stepped out quickly - torn between the desire to  scrub myself free of my pain and shock - to wash it  away, and remembering that I must call the doctor.  I called the doctor and asked him what to do. I was  shaky and still numb and my voice sounded strange to  me. Numbness must be the mind protecting the body  from the pain of knowledge. My doctor sent his nurse  to take me to the hospital. I asked him to call the  police to meet us there. I think I walked around the  house until the nurse came. I remember that she was  very kind to me.  DOCTOR,  POLICE AND OTHER FACES  My doctor is a gentle person.   He has seen me  through two major health crises and other smaller  events in the life of a woman who has had children.  I was numb until the moment I saw him. I cried  then and he held me and talked to me quietly. We  went through the examination much later and I was  somewhat calmer.   There were several attendant  women with me who talked to me and comforted me.  They too, were gentle and rational. I wondered if I  would ever be rational again - about this or anything.  While we talked, two detectives came into the room  and the slight bit of composure I had regained, snapped.  They were advised by the nurse that I would talk to  them later and they became quite angry with me, and  I suppose with my doctor.  (continued on page 11)   Women:  Educating  for Change    Women's Studies has an immediate  relevance and it tries to integrate the  concerns of both the academic  and public communities.    We want students, community organizers, secondary teachers and all persons interested in the women's  movement and/or in making a better society to attend  the National Women's Studies Association (NWSA)  Convention to be held at Indiana University, May 16-  20,   says Jean Robinson coordinator of Indiana University  Women's Studies Program,  Robinson added that the conference will be  four  rather intense days with a mixture of traditional  academic sessions and some less structured discussions.    Discussion topics will include: techniques of teaching  women's studies, special problems of teaching a class  that has both personal and scholarly aspects, ways to  select nonsexist texts, the need for positive role models,  and the integration of minority women's interests and  needs into a study program.  Robinson is encouraging persons interested in broadening their understanding of women's studies to attend the  spring conference.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Continued from page 2  A Woman's Own Name  Although the term Ms. fills a need in our manner of  addressing women, ifls rarely used in common conversation.   The titles Miss and Mrs. are valuable;  they tell us more than whether or not a woman is  married.   They also let us know whose surname a woman is using.   A divorced woman who resumes her  own name is  Miss Jones ; if she keeps the husband's  name, she is, although single,   Mrs. Smith.    The ostensible reason for using Ms. is to avoid defining oneself in terms of relationsHTp to a man. But  a Ms. Davis who is married to a Mr. Davis has already  defined her identity in terms of her marriage; here, the  use of Ms. is a contradiction.  Admittedly, some women who have used a husband's  name for years and years might feel silly, no matter  how sincere their feminism, in reverting to a name  that no one would recognize.   But, by the same reasoning, they should also feel silly changing their names if  they should marry again.  What about the solution many women choose: exchanging their own surname for their middle name?  Thus, marriage makes Mary Susan Smith into Mary  Smith Jones.   For retention of identity, this choice is  ineffective.    Ms. Smith Jones  will most likely be  addressed as Mrs. Jones, or even as one half of  Mr.  and Mrs. Stephen Jones.    The mortgage, electricity,  and telephone will all be listed under Jones . . . and  the class reunion committee will never find Mary Smith.  Real equality can never be achieved while half the  population loses its identity when marrying the other  half.   The choice may be difficult; the Establishment  may be incovenienced; the in-laws may feel rejected;  but women must become able to say,  Despite our  love and closeness, he is who he is, and I remain who  I am.   Women interested in resuming their birth names should  know that the process seldom requires a lawyer. Those  needing help may wish to contact the Center for a  Woman's Own Name, 261 Kimberly, Barrington   IL,  60010.  Editor's Note:   We found the center's  Booklet for Women  Who Wish to Determine Their Own Names after  Marriage  very informative and interesting. It costs   2.00.  M  Sojourner and  Susan B.

IWY   Coordinating   Committee   Re-conven  Members of The Indiana Coordinating Committee  for Observance of the International Women's Year  (1977) met with 58 persons, representing 36 state  organizations and agencies (and WOMANKIND),  to reaffirm their committment to the IWY National  Plan of Action that was decided upon in Houston in  1977.  The working conference was held on November 4  at the Indianapolis YWCA.   All participants agreed  to work on a task force or to work independently to  revive the resolutions submitted to President Carter.  Those resolutions concern: Women in Construction,  Vocational Education, Family Law, Child Care, Sex  Discrimination in Schools, No Fault Divorce, Spouse  Inheritance, Substance Abuse, and the establishment  of a Status of Women Commission.  Dispelling the Myths:     Women     in Other Cultures  by J. R   LAWRENCE  Below is a continuation of an article published in Issue XI in which the author discussed the Techambuli of New Guinea and the Ik of Uganda.  Unlike the Ik but similar in many ways to the  Techambuli are the Alorese of Alor Island(approx-  imately halfway between Java and New Guinea).  There, human life is more highly prized and valued,  though most women do not want children.  Like the Techambuli, men liken their wives to their  mothers in many ways, for they are the providers.  When children are small, they sleep with their mothers;  and grown men sometimes wake in the night and call  their wives'mother.'   When a woman enters into a  marriage, great financial responsibilities fall on her  shoulders.   Cora Dubois, in her 1960 book The People  of Alor, explains the male/female situation this way.-  Men are not the providers; in fact they  are quite the contrary. They are the ones  provided for...  An industrious wife is what most men seek. Those  studied by Dubois agreed that a wife should be hardworking and that the men should be rich. Because of  their power over the food, women can facilitate or  hinder a man's financial prosperity.   Females are  trained from infancy to enter the labor force. For  this reason, a single man-   who, of course, has  not had any gainful training   is at a distinct disadvantage, but, the cultural status of men requires  that they do little work.   It is therefore imperative  that a man seek a wife who can provide for him.  And, while the female's control over food gives them  power, it provides no status.  While the women toil, the men look after the  children in her absence.   This concept of paternal  childcare is not unique among the people of Alor.  The Mbuti pygmies of the Congo also employ this  method of upbringing the young.  The father's care of the child in the Alorese culture  can produce strong child/father bonding. Many times,  children try to nurse from their father's breast. Because the nursing infant is left without a source of  food while the mother is away each day, it may  nurse at the breast of another woman who has chosen  not to work that day.   The status of the father in the  community generally determines the type of child -  care he provides.  It is definitely the less busy   that is, the  less important   father who has the time  to be a good substitute mother.  Women do not usually cheerfully greet the news  that they are pregnant. It is the men who want children, not the women. Because of her work, the news  of a child means added   and unwanted   economic  responsibility for the female.   It also means discomfort, for the woman will continue to do heavy  field work during the course of her pregnancy.  Despite the fact that children are not always wanted  by the mother, it is the female who is often the aggressor or initiator of sexual activities.  As one Alorese husband reported to Dubois:  We men are the ones who want children.  Our wives don't. They just want to sleep  with us...  Sexual denial by either party during betrothal or  early marriage may occur if the bride-price is not  paid or there are other financial grounds. Thus, the  inadequate possession of wealth may add to a young  man's sexual frustration and reinforce the fact that it  is a high prerequisite for him to marry a woman who  will make him financially independent. He may,  further down the road, wish to acquire a second wife.  A woman's role in the Alorese culture is not always  defined exclusively by her providing food. In times  of warfare, heads may be taken in retaliation of a  murder. They may also be traded. Among the culture,  women's heads are as valuable as those of men, and in  one head-hunting expedition,  four out of ten heads  were of women.  In viewing the overall picture of the culture, then,  it is not difficult to understand that the society itself  is conducive to the linkage of food, wealth and sexual  relations .   Because of this linkage, women occupy a  central position in the culture and their importance is  underscored in times of warfare.  A group which is mo?t like our own is the Yanomamo.  Unlike the Alorese, or Techambuli, where women are  found to possess masculine responsibilities and a high  degree of power, the Yanomamoan culture is strongly  and decidedly male. Their culture also possesses some  of the same problems experienced by our own culture.  Their material culture is considered at the poverty level  when compared to the richness of their theological beliefs and myths.   The Yanomamoan rituals are still intact and are practiced.   There is a cooperative effort,  and a family structure exists: kinship bonds are very strong.  The practice of infanticide is present among the  Yanomamo, but it is not unique to their culture. Other  societies, among them the Polar Eskimos and the  Arunta of Australia, employ infanticide and with as  many reasons for it as the Yanomamo. Because the Yan-  ANCIENT  MIRRORS  of WOMANHOOD  Our Goddess and Heroine Heritage  00  M  O  O  CQ  w  g  m  A new book by the author of When God Was a  Woman. Available at The Woman's Touch     6352 W. 37th Street, Indianapolis, Ind. 46224,  phone 317-299-6336.  Arunta of Australia, employ infanticide and with as  many reasons for it as the Yanomamo. Because.Yan-  omamo wants to have first a male child, first-born  females are usually killed.   A child of either sex  may be killed if the mother is already nursing another  child.   (Women sometimes refuse to wean even when  the child reaches the age of two.) Sometimes a mother  will kill a child if she feels she cannot care for it properly.   Often, husbands intimidate wives while they are  pregnant and insist on a male child, and a wife will  kill the child if it is a female in order not to disappoint the husband.  A child may be aborted or killed  after birth. Both practices are common.  While the female is still young, a future spouse is  usually chosen for her.   Many factors may influence  a betrothal pledge--among them obligations of the  family and monetary considerations--and the child  usually has little or no say about whom she will marry.  Often, because of the youth of the female at the time  of the betrothal, the husband may aid in her rearing.  The status of the sex is learned at an early age, for  fathers tend to indulge their sons considerably more  than they do their daughters. While the male childhood may be continued into the youth's teen years,  a girl's adulthood begins at about ten. She is then  recognized as an economic asset and begins her  life of work. By the time a male child is recognized as an adult, his younger sister may already  be married and have children of her own.  She does agricultural work with her husband and is the  victim of his dictates. Her work is not done when her  husband has finished for the day, as she has yet to  gather firewood and often must travel miles to find it.  Huge loads of wood are carried in sling-like carriers on  her back.  In addition to the heavy work required of her, the  wife in the Yanomamoan culture must be quick to respond to the demands of her husband. When he returns  home, his meal must be prepared quickly, though  there is no stigma attached to men cooking, which they  sometimes do.   Because a wife may occasionally be  slow at cooking a meal or displeasing her husband in  some other way, it is her husband's right to punish her.  Wife beating is commonly accepted among the Yanomamo.   Though these  beatings  are usually mild in  execution, they sometimes achieve savage proportions.  Burning the flesh, shooting with a barbed arrow, or  chopping with a machete or axe are all methods employed to punish the wife. Deaths have occurred but  women have come to expect this kind of treatment  and the society has rationalized wife-abuse as a kindness:  Men feel it is good to beat their wives and women  feel the husband is showing his concern for her by physical abuse.  Thus, by the time a female is married, she is  vindictive and caustic to the external world         Her life  is molded into a frame wherein she inherits the duties  of the cultural norms without enjoying many of the  privileges, though old age brings a measure of respect to the female in the Yanomamoan culture.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  VERSE  What   Have   We   Done?  When we and the world were very young,  None of the stars had yet been strung.  None of the rhymes had been given tongue,  None of the music yet been sung,  When you and I and the world were young.  Then we forgot, in the rush of the years,  To look in the night sky for the stars;  To write our verse to bring smiles or tears,  To sing our songs to our waiting ears,  Or discuss ideas wise and sage,  While we and the world reached middle-age.  Now, we and the world grow sad and old.  The stars have dimmed, their light grown cold  The words have all been written or spoken;  The music's a record, cracked and broken.  Everything done, nothing won.  Why this progression from dust to dust?  What can we honestly say we've done?  We watch for a sign in every season  To find, at the end, total absence of reason,  Cold ashes from long-dead fires of lust  And a poet's pen that's turned to rust.

As I read O'Neill's list of famous women heroes:  Eleanor Roosevelt, Babe Didrikson Zaharias, Anne  Frank, Amelia Earhart, Nadia Comaneci, Jane  Fonda--I realized that I also could not remember  having had any female heroes as a child.  However, thumbing through the hundreds of short  biographies in this 752 page book did bring back the  memory of Agnes Smedley whose biography, Battle  Hymn of China, filled my fantasies when I was 22.  I had forgotten Agnes Smedley, who left a poor  coal mining town in Colorado at 16 to become a  live-in companion to an exiled Indian nationalist  leader in Berlin.  Growing weary of the role of housekeeper and hostess  to all her lover's revolutionary friends, she went to  China as a foreign correspondent in 1928, just in time  to witness the emergence of Chinese Communism.  Smedley, an ardent revolutionary, spent the next 22  years writing about poverty and class bias and helping  raise money for the Communist cause until her death  and burial in the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Park,  in China's national cemetery.  In this reference book, Smedley's life is allocated  only a few paragraphs, but it reminded me how important she had been to me during the 60' s when I was  a housewife yearning to be a reporter in a foreign  country.  The Women's Book of World Records and Achievements  abounds with stories of women like Smedley who have  lived exotic lives and/or lives of plain hard work against  tremendous odds.  This book covers historical contributions in politics,  agriculture, science, medicine, law, jeligion, education, communications, business, the military, sports,  arts, fashions, the labor movement, and the home.  These women from all parts of the world lived  during the latter part of the 19th century until the  present.  They include the first European woman to enter  the forbidden city of Lhasa, the first and youngest  female bullfighters, the only woman to have kicked  the teeth out of a great white shark and survived, the  first female marine general, the one who sold Gone  With The Wind to the movies, the woman who  fought the longest to get her job back, the spokeswoman for stepmothers, the mother of the miniskirt,  the first woman to drive an automobile across the  United States, and the first woman to judge a world  heavyweight fight.  O'Neill agrees that all these  firsts  may sound  like a lot of tokenism, but she stresses that seconds  and thirds were soon to follow many of these pioneers.   Our hope is that 50 years from now a book like this  could not be put together,   she says.  In practically any field today, this book has the  story of a woman who has done it first. This fact,  stead of discouraging the breaking of new ground,  should give comfort and support to the young girls  and women of today, who have not outgrown their  need for heroes.  in-  Available at THE WOMAN'S TOUCH in Indianapolis.

        <pagetext>6.  WOMANKIND  The Male    Female     Dialectic  WERE ALL FROM  AN UNRATIFIED  by      ROBERTA   LYNCH  It is difficult to pinpoint the exact historical event  that birthed the contemporary feminist movement.  But it has now been somewhere in the vicinity of a  decade since its emergence.  The changes wrought by the movement over the  last ten years have radically re-shaped our social  patterns:  The number of women in the workforce  has risen sharply.   Women have invaded nearly  every male profession.   Girls are participating  widely in all forms of sports.   Abortion is no longer  a criminal offense.   The list could go on and on.  Yet for all this remarkable progress, as we enter  the 1980's many women find themselves frustrated,  confused.   In part this is due to the resistance of the  larger society     the ERA battles, for instance. But  there is another factor -- more difficult to articulate, more disturbing to acknowledge: It is the sense  that men themselves are on the whole deeply resistant  to change.  In the course of a decade women have travelled at  an almost blinding pace along a twisted path still thick  with the brambles of a sexual history so ancient its origins  remain in obscurity.     Occasionally, we crash into  thickets, stuck in the complications of our past. And  even as we go forward, we still bruise far too easily,  our bodies now more attuned to their environment,  more susceptible to its assaults.   But we have a  sense of momentum that cannot easily be halted or  diverted.  Women did not come to this journey simply out of  curiosity or anger; the pressures acting on us were  enormous and we had, in reality, no choice but to  embark.   Men, on the other hand, have had few  concomitant pressures and have been much slower to  move.   And, as they begin to sense that it is not simply  a matter of  catch-up      of women coming to be where  they are -- but of them also changing, of a path that  leads to a wholly new place, many men have drawn  back.   Angry that they can't keep up, they are retrenching     and claiming the superiority of their  original position.  The result is that the most striking feature of  America's personal life is no longer the generation gap,  but the gender gap.  The question of how to live out our lives with this  tension is the source of much of our current unease.  The ideology of the movement no longer seems clear.  For confusion is not easy to symbolize on banners and  uncertainty does not make for good polemics.  Some of our most important political thinking is now  emerging in new forms.   Fiction is becoming an essential element of our collective growth because it is one  of the few forms that     like reality itself     flourishes  on ambiguities.     It allows the most extreme statements  because it constantly forces them to co-exist with the  complexities of life against which they must stand. In  essence, and whether we like it or not, The Women's  Room is the Sexual Politics of this time.  Marian Engel, a leading Canadian novelist, describes  the situation as  warfare  in her latest book.   Her protagonist says of her former husband:     Asher was afraid  of my having any power, even domestic power.     And  then goes on:    If Asher were the only man who felt  this way there would be no point in what I am now  going to do; but there are hundreds and thousands of  them, men who are afraid of giving women any power,  II   1                               : r-  017) 299-2276  tM/Aena  tAb fa / (S   aft Ate 4  FULL SERVICE PRINTING  6236 LINDA LANE  lt;  ;*    gt; INDIANAPOLIS. INDIANA   46241  any power at all; who must bind them and hurt them. ..  probably to prevent what they fear is the female side  of themselves from getting out of hand.    The most visible and frightening manifestation of  this hostility is the growing incidence of rape --up  20  from last year despite the growth of anti-rape  programs.  Many men are genuinely horrified by the most brutal  rapes.   But there still exists an atmosphere of indifferent  tolerance, even sly joking, even covert approval ( that  tease got what she deserved ) among men that shapes  our societal attitude toward rape.  Thus, it has become increasingly clear that the  rapist is not necessarily the social aberrant he was  once presumed to be.   In Chicago, he may be your  local policeman: A former Chicago cop -- with a  record for apprehending rapists -- was recently convicted of assaulting and raping a young woman.   In  Tennessee, he may be your friendly fireman:  A  Knoxville woman was tied to the bed of a firehouse  for 18 hours and raped by 25 - 30 firemen.  Most men, of course, do not express their antagonism toward women through anything as grotesque as  rape.   But though it may be muted, it is seldom completely submerged.   The contempt, the animosity, the  objectification are so prevalent in everything from  casual conversations to exalted literary publications  that they are impossible to ignore or wish away.   And  those who count on some natural erosion of these  phenomena need only hang out for a few hours at  their local high school to have such hopes dashed.  These are the contradictions that women must live  with now    - that we are free to seek the job of our  choice, but do not feel free to walk the street of our  choice after dark; that we have won a certain amount  of respect for our intelligence, but are still treated  with contempt for our sexuality; and, finally, that our  desires for love, companionship, relatedness must coexist with our recognition of deep-rooted animosity.  To blame the women's movement for this state of  affairs is absurd.   Christopher Lasch -- mistaken in  many of his assessments of feminism --is fundamentally  correct in his insistence that men's resentment toward  women antedates the women's movement and cannot  be assuaged by a change in its tactics.  The women's movement has only served to expose  to the light this dark underside of the male-female  dialectic.   It did not cause it.   And we have only a  prayer that it can cure it.  None of this is to say that men have not changed at  all -- or that they are incapable of change.   But it is  to insist that we ignore at our own peril the ways that  this change has failed to penetrate the encrusted layers  of primordial fear and conditioned hostility.  Given the faint likelihood that this ancient battle will  ever conform to traditional notions of political struggle,  it is difficult to imagine how it will be resolved. Initially, women believed in the power of our ideas, in  the weight of morality, in the strength of law. Now  all of these seem pale as we watch men guard their  power which has become so entrenched as to appear  indistinguishable from their selfhood.  I don't know where our hope lies.   I know that women  did not create this cultural chasm and that we cannot  easily cross it or circumvent it.   Perhaps it is only when  there are enough women who realize this and who refuse  to any longer allow men their illusions of superiority,  that there will be any possibility of a genuine reconciliation between the sexes.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  7.  Two reviews on  Being Crazy...   by  PAT  WATSON  BEING CRAZY IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME  SANE , Sharon Hatton's first musical, is a pure delight.   It made me proud to be an Indianapolis woman and realize there is so much talent in our town.  When four women and a boy -- all amateurs --  can keep an audience entertained for two solid hours  with songs, dances and a good storyline, somebody's  doing something right.  It all clicked.   Suzanne Wilson's music was by turns  lyrical, mournful and jubilant.   Even on a limited  stage, Director Kathy D. Ballard brought it all together  admirably.. Ms. Hatton has written a superb play , a  cohesive show.  Played by Pam Petruzzi, Lisa is the most powerful  character in the musical.   Child-woman Lisa discovers her married lover has lied to her. After their  break-up, she discovers she is pregnant, even though  he told her he had had  one of those operations.    Facing the life vs. death decision, for Lisa, the  wisest choice is giving her baby up for adoption. Her  heart-wrenching  Lullaby and Goodby  moved this  stoic reviewer.  Kathryn, played by Nancy Sundell, represents a  new phenomenon in our culture: the woman whose  marriage has broken up after twenty years. She is  waiting for  Gerald to come to his senses ; then she  understands that a job is going to be essential for the  first time in twenty years.   To help Kathryn, the women role-play a job interview which is one of the most  hysterically funny routines done on any stage. Kathryn  comes into her own in the third act singing: I'm a  new and different woman, as free as I can be. So  toodle-oo to Gerald and hello to Kate, that's me.    David, Rennie's son, played by Spencer Sundell,  must have had stage experience in his previous incarnations.   This kid is terrific.   He sings. He dances. He  moves on stage like a pro.   He plays an average twelve-  year -old boy who copes with major changes in his life  in an above-average way.   The play would not have  worked without him; he adds the spice to the salad-  Mickey Jones as Sandy, a young woman who has  just left her husband, was excellent, portraying the  initial hesitancy combined with rebellion that most  women feel at that time. She is  the fixer  who  sings  Who ever fixes me?    She speaks for all longing women who are starting to explore freedom when  she sings  I think I'll be an artist, a dancer proud  and free. I think I'll be a sailor, and set sail on the  sea. All alone, just me....    Karen Emanuel as Rennie is David's mother who  discovers she is a lesbian when she meets her special  friend, Margie, at the PTA. David is not bothered by  his mother's lesbianism for he likes Margie a lot  better than his new stepmother.  Special praise goes to Suzanne Wilson, composer-  musical director and pianist. She was beautifully  backed by Shirley Weller on drums, Carol Simmons  on base and Mary Funk on oboe.  This reviewer thinks Ms. Hatton could have made a  good running gag with the squeaky bed from the   people upstairs  to carry through the show. She got one  good laugh but could have had many more.  Sharon Hatton has written a great show.  This play is available for tour.

The play I saw these five performers in was BEING  CRAZY IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME SANE   This musical/comedy/drama by Sharon Hatton with  music by Suzanne Wilson is the story of four women  trying to cope with divorce, unwanted pregnancy,  lesbianism, and the fulfillment of human dreams.   The  bittersweet tone of the play found much of the audience  identifying with its characters, as most of the experiences the cast underwent happen everyday.  I was impressed by the character Kathryn, a somewhat staid, older married woman who is just discovering what her own potentialities are.   Nancy Sundell,  who plays Kathryn, brings to the stage a funny, brave,  and sad portrayal of a woman who, after many years  of marriage, is disillusioned by her husband and his   me  syndrome.   The  interview  scene establishes  Sundell as a truly talented woman refusing to play a   role  for anyone.   It is a rib-tickling, side-splitting  perfect parody of what often happens in a job interview.  Mickey Jones did an excellent job of playing Sandy,  the compulsive volunteer. Sandy, after resigning as  everybody's  fixer , is striking out on her own to find  and fix herself. In doing so, she relies on the emotional support of two other women, plus Kathryn, who  are also searching for themselves.  Rennie, compassionately portrayed by Karen Emanuel,  is Sandy's best friend.   Divorced, raising a young son,  Rennie learns to face her latent lesbianism. She also  learns that loving does not necessarily mean having to  simulate a domestic nest.   Sandy supports her friend  and gives Rennie quiet encouragement.  Lisa is a vamp.   Blithely dancing through life, always  in a playful mood, Lisa, brilliantly performed by Pam  Petruzzi, is the quintessence of a butterfly who flits  from flower to flower.   Sadly brought to earth, Lisa  finds she is to have a baby.   Love for the unborn child  makes her realize she is not equipped to care for it  properly.   She painfully opts for adoption.  At first it was hard to understand what David, played  somewhat hesitantly by Spencer Sundell,  was actually  doing in this play.   I soon realized, however, that he  was not a foil to his mother's (Rennie's) lover, but a  fact of life.   As I watched David grow, I knew I would  love to have a son as caring as he.  The songs are soul-stirring, thought-provoking, and  vastly entertaining.   I grew impatient during the set  changes because I wanted to know wh at was going to  happen next.   You are not human if Lisa's goodbye to  her baby does not make you want to cry.  Sharon Hatton, I bow to you as a consumate playwright. The world needs more of your Dlays.

C. Starker has now written a moving play which  was presented at the Indiana University-Purdue  University dinner theatre in the Student Union  building in Indianapolis, in November.  THE QUILT MAKER   centers on Granny, an 83-  year-old hickory stick of a woman who pieces  broken lives as she pieces her quilts.  Ms. Starker's talent for weaving a story from the  threads of her background reaches a maturity with  THE QUILT MAKER.   Her readers hope she will continue 'piecing* her stories and one day present us  with a full quilt of a book.  I won't attempt to summarize the plot, which is  touching and tragic.   I'll just say Ms. Starker knows  her mountain people and presents well the strengths  and weaknesses of the human soul.   Ms. Starker's  most charming talent lies in her poetic phrasing, a  delicate art that can be easily damaged by too much  tinkering or rewriting.  The cast all displayed sensitivity to Ms. Starker's  story about a retarded, half-wild mountain child.  The audience believed they were there, in the  1940's Company Store, sitting in the corner, knitting  or whittling as the drama unfolded before them.  Perfect in her portrayal of Granny   is Teresa Wains-  cott.   Stiff in body but sharp of tongue, she is keenly  aware of her responsibilities to her community as an  herb medicine specialist and as one who has lived a  long time.  Andrea Weber plays Granny's daughter, Mabel  Highnight, manager of the Company Store since her  husband was killed in the mine.   She is just as prideful  as her mother, but not yet hardened in the fires of time.  Jonny Estep, who stopped sowing his wild oats when he  got the call to be a fundamentalist preacher, is portrayed  by James Berry, who is the real catalyst of the play.  Camilla Upchurch plays Jonny's sister-in-law, Hanna,  who pathetically bakes a 21st birthday cake for her son  who has died in World War II.  Suzie Schock plays Gracey Jacobs, the wild, retarded  witch-child on whom the plot turns.   It is a particularly  difficult role as the child has never learned to speak,  but Suzie wins our hearts and pity.  Tom Karnes portrays Abel Weiss, a weary miner worn  bone-thin by the struggle to care for his family. He is  demoralized by the revelation of one of Granny's secrets.  The set, a Company Store, perfectly conveys the  bleak life of a coal mining community     a bleakness brightened by the determination of the human  spirit and Granny's quilts.

        <pagetext>8.  e*  -I've Got To Get o  by PAT HEIDENREICH  It pays to be organized... especially during the  holiday season.   If I had been organized, I wouldn't  have had to use Happy Birthday napkins for a  Christmas cocktail party.   And my husband wouldn't  have had to cook the steaks that night on the grill  in the back yard, standing in the snow, because I  forgot to clean the oven broiling pan.  I did think ahead enough to take his red wool  shirt to the cleaners for the occasion.   I even  picked it up on time, a half hour before the guests  arrived.   I was organized. I was happy. If he  hadn't had a shaker of Pink Squirrels explode all  over the kitchen and his red shirt, everything  would have been O. K.   I don't have any clean shirts,   he announced in  the living room, after rummaging through the bedroom closet.   Ha-ha,   I laughed, sipping my grasshopper,   who does laundry over the holidays?   Several of my guests, it turned out, had done  laundry that very day. I made a mental note to  skip them for the next party.   What fun is it to be  with a bunch of show offs, anyway?  If I had thought ahead, the children at the party  would've had lots of planned games with prizes for  entertainment and wouldn't have had to resort, out  of boredom, to a Play-Doh fight. And the one  guest that is expecting in a month wouldn't have had  a big flat Play-Doh pancake plop on her protuberance.  The next day, valiantly disregarded a roaring  headache, I vowed I would get organized. Taking my  last four year's calendars, I compiled all birthdays,  anniversaries, basketball and swimming schedules  into my new executive  Week-At-A-Glance  notebook.   I had to go back four years, because last  year's calendar was grossly unmarked with pertinent  facts, such as my mother-in-law's birthday (which I  most noticeably, by her, missed) and my best friend's  July birthday. (I took her out for lunch in November,  to make up for it.)  Besides this master book for the year, I also set up  daily lists of things to do.   Well, my sister-in-law's  birthday, January 2nd,   snuck up and passed by...  that's understandable, but my friend in Cincinnati  had a birthday on January 6th. In my daily records I  wrote on the Wed. January 3rd. page...  Buy and  mail Aggie's card .   It didn't get done, so I remarked  it on the Thursday page... and then on Friday's page.   Well, I would call her on Saturday., her birthday,  and that would be better anyway,   I thought. But,  alas, the day passed, filled with children's activities  and writing and not one thought for Aggie.  And so it goes.   The year is only 2 weeks old and  already I've blown two birthdays, forgot to order  fuel oil   resulting in a very cold and grumpy family,  and neglected to send an'explained absense' note to  the teacher, which would've avoided a giant hassle  with the school system and my daughter being mad at  me.  A more modern term for disorganized is  spacey   and in the pressroom I seem to have been nominated  for the title  Spacey Lady .   Which, of course, is  completely unfair.   How was I supposed to know that  the 35 mm camera was out of film. Just because a  whole day of fabulous scoop pictures were recorded on  nothing, doesn't mean I'm not trying.  Don't  give    up  If your article or contribution did not appear in  this issue, don't worry. It will probably be in the  next issue. We wish we had more pages   YWG   4460 Guion Road  Indianapolis, Indiana  A women's movement in  tune with the  80's  WOMANKIND  ...Winning...  by Sandy Clark Boone  Everyone knows that when the tortoise raced with  the hare his dogged determination won the race. For  years, I have admired that never-say-die, hard-backed  tortoise because, 1) he won, and 2) he kept trying a-  gainst unbelievable odds.   Life, after all, is a terminal  illness, so we are all born fighting the odds.   My kingdom for one more day   the dying Queen  Victoria offered.   Once is not enough,   Joe E. Lewis said (and Jack ie  Susanne quoted).  Like the tortoise, we fight on. Babies fight to be  fed, children to be heard, and adults to be recognized.   We fight bad eyesight, fallen arches, and  constantly being too old or too young to do whatever it is we have in mind.   Life is so precious to us  that many would give great fortunes for one more day,  and yet, we act like a condemmed man rushing through  his last meal because he feels he will gain so much  more that way.   Suddenly, I am no longer certain that  it is the tortoise that deserves to be lauded.   And I  have two reasons for believing the way I do.   First of  all, he won and secondly, he kept trying against unbelievable odds.   After all, winners are easy to love.  They are valiant, brave, true, honest, hard-working,  and fair-haired.   What of the loser, the imperfect,  sometimes cowardly, occasionally lazy, and often  acned anti-hero?  We need to love imperfect people,  especially when the imperfect soul is the one who  stares back at us from our mirrors.   We need to make  peace with our terminal exsistence, our short-sighted  eyes, our sore feet, and our muddled minds. As for  trying and trying against unbelievable odds, one might  ask what it was the tortoise was trying for. To prove for  all time that tortoises are faster than hares?  Why? Is  faster necessarily better?  Is a loving cup, the sound of  applause, a moment of glory worth the time, the  effort, the agony of saving,  I won?   Is winning, by  and of itself, a virtue?  The tortoise has his place in history and rightfully so.  I would not presume to pre-empt him in his place of  glory, but the thought occurs to me over and over again,  in our hurry-up, do-something, super-highway world,  that the hare was not without his saving graces. We  are not told by the fairy tale that this particular hare  was generally a lazy, do-nothing character. We are  only informed that on this particular day he mis-judged  the abilities of the tortoise or over-estimated his own  worth.   Mis-judgment has happened to all of us and  is probably the best school we will ever attend. It is  also of worth to note that at least the hare arrived  well-rested, and that is not a bad moral for anyone.  A Present  to myself  Have you ever felt depressed after Christmas?  Do  you sometimes feel guilty that you experience anger  at your family during what is supposed to be the most  wonderful time of the year?  Do you get tired of the  shopping, the planning, the cooking, the present-  wrapping?  As television and radio commercials tell  you repeatedly that this is the time of joy and happiness,  do you at times feel like crying?  Christmas brings much strain and frustration.  Yuletide reality never seems to work out like our  childhood memories say it should.   The extra stress  - of entertaining, party-going, dealing with relatives,  spending more money than we know we should - can  be overwhelming.  People going through emotional crises might find the   holiday cheer  especially hard to handle.   Because  I have recently become separated from my husband of  twelve years, a friend gave me an idea for helping me  cope with life in general and the past holiday season in  particular.   She showed me her  affirmation chain  and  started one for me.  On her office doornob hung three stapled strips of  construction paper.   Words were written on each one:   SUNBURST ,   TWINKLING EYES , and  AFFECTIONATE'1.   Friends made these for me to remind me of my  positive attributes, Judi,   she explained.    It feels  good to see them and think about what they say.  Sometimes I walk over and re-read them.   I bet your  friends would be glad to make an affirmation chain for  you.    You mean I'd have to ask somebody to write something nice about me?.   Sure    If you don't ask, how else will you get it?    I don't know... I'd feel funny about asking...     It might be hard at first.     Kathy,... would... would you make me a link?    I'd be glad to.    I watched silently as she cut a two-inch strip of  green paper.   After choosing an orange felt-tip pen,  she wrote on the paper, stapled it in two places, and  handed it to me.   Here's the first link of your affirmation chain, Judi.    I read the words,  WARM AND CREATIVE .   Kathy  thinks I'm warm and creative?  I didn't know she thought  of me that way.   Wow, reading your words makes me feel special.  Thanks, Kathy,   I said.  As I left her office, I wondered how I could possibly  ask anybody else for a link.   It was hard enough asking  Kathy, and she had suggested the whole thing.   How  would others react?  A few hours later I explained the affirmation chain  to a friend.   Holding my breath, I handed her a blue  piece of paper and magic marker as I made my request.  When I approached a co-worker the next morning, I  felt uncertain.   I didn't know him well, but he had  always treated me with friendly respect and seemed  like a caring person.   What a terrific idea   he exclaimed.    I'd love to  do that for you, Judi.    Taking the yellow paper which I held out to him, he  responded,  I hope you don't mind though  if I get it to  you later.   I have a meeting in thirty minutes that needs  my attention now.   I didn't mind at all.   When I opened his envelope that  afternoon, I glowed as I read his long list of adjectives.  That day I asked five people to add to my chain.    Though each time I asked with hesitancy and some fear,  I know future requests will be easier.   No one has rejected me yet    Everyone seems genuinely pleased about  being asked.   And they all smile as they read the words  I've written for the first link in their chain.  Do you like the idea of knowing the nice things  people are thinking about you?  Could you use an  emotional boost after Christmas?   Why not ask a  friend today to make the first link of your chain? Begin 1980 by reminding yourself of your positive qualities.  I am enjoying my affirmation chain. I plan to continue with it throughout the year.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  On Perseverance  by MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  A Retired Housewife  by JANE  TILFORD  Her feet hurt.   She had never been  much on walking; this endless walk  was against her very grain.   But she  had to find someone to help her, or  she knew she would be in danger of  losing her life.   She was very  far  from her home and was so badly  hurt that she had no idea of where  her home was, or how to get there.  She lifted a foot and examined it  with lackluster eyes.   The skin was  still whole.   Good  She could continue.  It was a gray, cool early Sunday morning. I brought  the paper inside and we drank coffee and turned pages  and occasionally spoke of an item of interest, then  returned to our reading.   One of our gentler spoofs is  that my husband is enraptured by the doings of  That  Angel in the White House,   as he calls the youngest  Georgian.   He pretends severe disappointment when  there are no blurbs planted concerning tree houses or  violin lessons.   We add a paragraph or two to this engaging story almost every week.   We had tired of our  games and the paper and Bill walked out on the porch  to survey his city-lot-sized realm.   I heard him walk  down the steps, then call,  Come look at this    He was standing on the ground next to our neighbors' porch rail.   Beside his head, a beautiful, slender,  gray-blue pigeon stood as if it were frozen there. He  petted it, pulling one finger lightly and slowly from its  crown, down its back.   This elicited no response: he  couldn't tell if the soft touch had pleased, or displeased  the bird.  He spoke to it, quietly; it only looked at him. We  decided that it was someone's pet and would soon wing  its way home.    Come on back in,   I said com-  panionably.    How about some breakfast now?   Her head was almost too heavy to hold  up, now.   It had been so long since  she'd had rest, or food, that she was  in severe straits. She had to urge herself onward. How much farther could  she go?  How could she make her needs  known? Her mouth dropped open. She  began gulping ragged breaths of air  through this wider passageway. She  started forward again, but the effort  to get underway was almost beyond her.  Her heart raced as it tried to distribute  more oxygen to her exhausted muscles.  She was dimly aware that her vision was  becoming adversely affected.  On Sunday, we have something approximating   brunch  at around ten or so, then our dinner at  around three and five, then snacks whenever.   Bill  wanted to see an early movie, so after our late breakfast he went back out to do his Sunday yard work  earlier than usual.   He was back inside in less than a  minute.   He called,  The next door pigeon is on our  porch, now    I went to the door and watched the pigeon, which was  walking in erratic circles on our porch floor.  Can you  pick her up?  I asked.  Bill squatted before the pigeon and held his hands out,  palms up, parallel to the floor.   The pigeon, visibly  trembling, came within his reach.   He picked the little  bird up and when she was safelv wrapped by his fingers,  she collapsed and closed her eyes.   7 gt;TuT-.Til l gt;     It was as if she had held on, by superpigeon effort, until she had reached safety.   He brought her to me, her  limp wing trailing over his fingers.   She was a beautiful  bird.   Her gray-blue feathers were lightly marked with  white and gray tracings; her feet and bill were a cranberry-orangey red.   Her eyes were rimmed with the  same coloring.   Most important, she wore a tiny aluminum band around her leg  The marker was stamped   IND-78  followed by a four-digit number.   We correctly assumed that the bird had been banded in Indiana in 1978 and that the following numbers were her  individual identification.   We decided to care for her  needs first:  Bill found a good-sized packing crate and  put bird, seed, bread and water in it.   He placed the  crate on a bench in the garage, to protect the pigeon  from heat and marauding cats or dogs.   Then we went  to the Yellow Pages for help.  There was no help there    No pigeon clubs, pigeon  fanciers, pigeon breeders or pigeon racing clubs were  listed.   We thumbed through the white pages with similar results.   In a last-ditch effort, I remembered that  a Mr.  Bud  Starling wrote a very informative bird  column in a local paper and found his name in the  telephone directory.   We were fortunate: Mr. Starling  knew the local pigeon-racing club hierarchy and gave  us the name and telephone number of the president.  When we contacted him, he said that he'd come get  the bird and hold it until he could find its owner and  return it to its home.   He would be able to find the  owner the next day, he said, when he opened his  office.  When she had climbed those last steps, she  knew that she could go no farther, alone.  If the people here couldn't understand her  problem, she would have no further recourse.   When the bigger one held her,  she collapsed.   She had been brave long  enough: surely now these people would  see her safely home.  The president of the racing club and his young son  came to take the pigeon home.   When Bill brought the  box to him, he lifted the bird and examined her.   Here,   he said,  is where she struck, or was struck by,  some object, probably while in flight.     He gently  pulled a  V -shaped, bloodied notch of torn skin on  her breast.     And here,   he pointed at the bony ridge  atop her wing, where two pinion feathers stood at odd  angles.    It was impossible for her to fly,   he told us.   God knows how far she's walked, trying to find her  way home.   There had been a   Cross-country  event early  Saturday morning, from which, he said, the birds  should have flown home before dark that evening.  He said the club records would give him her owner's  name: then he and his son and  our  pigeon drove  away.   We watched until they turned the corner,  then came back into the house.   I sat quietly,  thinking of the tremendous, courageous effort the  little bird had made.   I could see it, braving dogs  and cats and unkind humans on its long search for  home.   I was glad that it had found us.   About an  hour later, Bill said,  You know, I've been thinking about how hard that pigeon worked to preserve its  life.   I wonder how many porch steps it had to climb  to find us?   She rested and slept, then ate and rested  and slept again.   As the sun went down  on the third day, her owner took her  home.   She is retired from racing, but  she is home.   She is apparently well.  I hope that she is happy.  ryi  153  rs.  a  ADVERTISING RATES  Display: Business card  13.50  1/8 page  25  1/4 page  50  1/2 page  100  full page  250  Discounts for 6 consecutive ads.

Whenever I join a group  of women who  do  various things, I hear this.   The  question bothers me because I don't know how to answer.   To my mind, women who  do  are teachers,  journalists, vice-presidents, tailors, soldiers, clerks.  For a specific number of hours they do something  under a speciality that is listed somewhere alpha -  betically.  I'm a retired housewife.   When my children were  growing up I seldom was asked,  What do you do?   perhaps because whatever group I joined was for a  limited purpose.   For instance, to women in Scouts  I was a Scout leader; to PTAers, a sometime chairperson; for the founders of a new high school, a fundraiser. By none of these limits, however, would I introduce myself generally or say that this is what I do.  When I say I'm a retired housewife, someone wilT  counter with,  I didn't know you could retire from  THAT.     I'm not sure what THAT is. It could be  nothing. Or, more likely, it could be all the routine  work of housekeeping.   With househusbands out of the  closet and the practicality of roommates acknowledged,  I thought the housewife/housework coupling was unhitched  long ago, at least in principle; for me it was never a  serviceable linkage.   Obviously one's house must be  kept; everyone whose house it is   should keep it.  In the late forties when I first acquired a house, Jan  Struther published her popular book, Mrs.  Miniver ; in  it she said that the mechanics of life should never be  allowed to interfere with living.   For Mrs. Miniver,  mechanics meant household matters, which for her in  England included a Nannie, a parlour maid, and a cook.  I liked the story and decided that for me in middle  America, to be a housewife meant taking care of the  mechanics of my household.   However, I vowed these  mechanics should not be allowed to interfere with  living.  But I can't explain all this every time someone  asks,  What do you do Jane?   Whoever asks the question today probably does something which is alphabetically listed; for that I respect her, and support  her rights.   I think she wouldn't care to hear how I  felt fortunate to be able to be a housewife-, to tear  my war-postponed family without also working away  from home.    Whether I was doing what the majority  of women did then was of no concern to me, nor is  it now.   Eventually my children grew up. I retired  from that way of living.  To say I'm a retired mother would be insufferably  sanctimonious, and not true, but to say I'm a retired  housewife implies that my way of living has changed,  which is certainly true. It's also a facetious comment  made in anticipation of the reaction that a housewife  doesn't  do  anything   from THAT, too, I might as  well be retired.  Of course the mechanics of life continue, but they  should not be allowed to interfere with living. Like  other women whose children are grown I actually do  many things, none of which I've yet selected as a  definition of myself.   When I can be a part of an  alphabetical listing, that will be what I  do.n  Until then, I'm a retired housewife.

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  Reviewing The Revue  by   JUDY  SMITH  In Indianapolis, Labyris is a feminist bar and a  gathering place for women.   One of the scheduled  entertainment events is a monthly  Women's Revue  and Show,    which basically consists of a series of  acts in which performers lip-synch to popular records.   I saw the September presentation and have  been churning ever since.   This  female drag show   elated, excited, amused, confused, worried, frightened, and disappointed me; in short, I loved and  hated it.  Why did I love it?  I was pleased to see local  women give a well-rehearsed, polished performance.  I quickly became involved in the high level of excitement engendered in the audience.   I truly identified  with some of the situations portrayed, and I particularly  appreciated the emotional spectrum, from helpless  sniveling to triumphant power, expressed in the rendition of a woman telling her lover,  It's Over.   The  tight timing impressed me, especially in the ensemble's   Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.    I watched with admiration  as the light technician wielded the spotlight with the  intense grace of a turret gunner.   I enjoyed being sexually stimulated in a mostly female crowd, and congratulated myself on being so  adult.   It was fascinating to see women of my acquaintance acting out  the ultrafeminine roles that we have been taught from  babyhood to play, but have tended to abandon in our  real, feminist lives.   Struck by the tremendous power  innate in each woman, I was impressed but frightened,  seeing how their use of makeup and Playboy-feminine-  sexy costume triggered approving, emotional outbursts  in the audience.  Why did I hate it? I was disturbed by the tone of the  event.   I felt like I was witnessing a parody of a parody:  the female-contemptuous male drag show transmuted into a scene of women deliberately tantalizing (pimping?)  other women for money. Were they playing to the   butch  element in us, the dirty-old-man aspect of  patriarchially conditioned lesbian consciousness? If  so, is this a laudable form of entertainment, or a  sick copy of a degenerate amusement?  Presented raw,  without comment, critique, or any opportunity for  analytical reaction, rather than enlightening and  nourishing us it seems to play on parts of our psyches  that many of us have spent agonizing hours in and out  of therapy trying to identify and heal.   Are we coming of age, now that we can behave like the  big  boys,   stomping and yelling and carrying on when a  bewigged, cosmetic-masked, negligee-clad  beautiful  woman flaunts herself for our titillation, or are  we regressing to a pre-feminist psychic jungle?  I did  not join the line of ardent fans who clamored to put  dollars in the actresses' bosoms, for I was not sure  just what personal service had been rendered.   I  felt it more appropriate and clear-cut to tip the  waitron, * but only after hearing some comments from  a feminist friend who felt insulted by the show.  Mary Byrne, in her Labyris newsletter of 10/23/79,  calls the show,  something just light and entertaining  where we can let loose, have fun and enjoy,   but I  feel this kind of entertainment is actually very heavy  in its implications, and not really much fun if it keeps  us mired in the sexist, exploitative patterns we would  like to transcend.   Maybe I'm an old prude, too conditioned in my own attitudes toward sexy amusement  to be able to break out of my mental and emotional  straightjacket and simply enjoy it without embarrassment or revulsion, but I have to admit, it bothered me.  What disturbed me the most was the absence of a sense  of responsible feminism, the ambiguity of the presentation     was it tongue-in-cheek or naively sincere?  Was it deliberately ambiguous, intentionally confusing,  to stir up controversy?  I couldn't tell. Maybe this type  of Revue and Show is a beginning, will evolve into  something that makes a strong feminist statement. I  think feminists in theater should hold ourselves accountable for the messages people receive from us, and if the  point of view of a production is fuzzy, the audience is  bound to be confused.  I would like to see some opportunity for discussion  built into the format of the Revue.   I would like to  hear other people's reactions. A show so stirring on  so many levels is an important facet of women's culture, whether one is in favor of it or opposed to it.  I think more public sharing of opinions would be very  healthy for our community.  * waitron: a nonsexist occupational title picked up at  Food for Thought, Washington, D. C.  How about actron for the working performer?  Blessed be Sonia Johnson  ERA activist  recently excommunicated  from her ? church  The Parable  of the  Melon Grower  by JOYCE BRINKMAN  Once in the southern part of the United States there  was a young man who had some farm land given unto  him. Thinking watermelons were the most succulent  of all foods, he decided to plant melons on his land.  This young man was a very hard worker.   He had  been to the nearby university and was learned in the  skills of modern agriculture.   He used the best fertilizers, the finest seeds, and the latest equipment for  preparing his land.   He knew the best time to plant.  He knew how much water to use. He knew what he  should add to the soil and when it should be added.  Because he worked so hard and because he knew a  great deal about agriculture, his plants grew and grew.  They were extremely healthy plants and brought forth  Lovely blossoms which promised to bear much fruit.  As the new melons began to appear, the young  farmer became apprehensive.   His small plot of land  was next to a much traveled road and many passers-  by had noticed his garden.   To himself he said,   My melons are too big a temptation to some  travelers.   I must do something to keep them safe.    So the young farmer built a high wall around his  melon garden.   He worked day and night. He carried  in large stones, mixed mortar to hold them together  and made a large and formidable wall.   He strung  lights so he could sit on his wall and see all of his  garden clearly at night.   Many sleepless nights he  spent as his melons became larger and larger.  Finally, he came to the conclusion that he  couldn't be there night after night.   So he decided  to travel to the next county and visit his uncle who  raised German Shepherds.   I'm sure he can train  some dogs for me to protect my melon patch, he  thought.  Off he went in search of better protection for his  melon field.   He purchased the dogs from his uncle  and within two weeks returned with the trained dogs.  Arriving home, he was surprised to find that not one  single melon had been stolen.   Every one was on  its vine, but each was rotten.   The young melon  grower had spent so much time trying to protect his  delicious melons from those who might covet them  that he had neglected their care and missed the  time of their harvest himself.   Some husbands are  just like that young melon grower.  Women in Public Office  STATE LEGISLATURES  The number of women serving in state legislatures  throughout the country has more than doubled from  305 (4.1 ) in 1969 to 767 (10.3 ) in 1979.  STATEWIDE ELECTIVE AND CABINET OFFICES  The number of women in state cabinet level or  equivalent executive positions has increased from  84 (10. Z ) in 1975 to 97 (10.1 ) in 1977.   All  women incumbents who sought reelection to their  statewide posts in 1979 won their races.  GOVERNORS  Ella Grasso (Connecticut) and Dixy Lee Ray  (Washington) are the only women ever elected  chief executive of a state in their own right.  Three other women have succeeded their husbands  in office.  LT. GOVERNORS  In 1978 a record was set with the election of 4  new women Lt. Governors, which increased the number  of women in this post to 6.  STATE JUDICIARY  Out of about 5, 940 positions in October, 1978,  110 women (1.8 ) served as judges in appellate  courts and trial courts of general jurisdiction.  LOCAL OFFICE  In 1977, 9, 930 women composed 7. 8  of officials  at the local level, compared to 5, 931 (4.4 ) in 1975.  The number of women in mayoralties and on municipal  and township governing bodies has increased by more  than 36  since 1975.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  11  Rape (continued from page 3)  It is a boorish, cruel world sometimes.   It is a man's  world.   Women have only begun to fight back. Men  are not only uniquely capable of rape; they are the  ones who have written the laws that deal with it, give  the advice, interpret the reasons for it, and in most  instances, when police interviews and interrogations  take place, they are also the ones who ask the questions.  The questions continued.  QUESTION:   Can you give us a description of the man  who allegedly attacked you?  ANSWER:      Yes, he was...  QUESTION:   Have you ever seen this man before?  ANSWER:     No.  QUESTION:   Are you quite sure you have never seen  him before - that you didn't know him  from someplace?  ANSWER:     No, I don't know him - why won't you  believe me?  I balked.   I shouted all the rage that was inside me.  Everything came hurtling from my mouth. I hated him,  I hated them - two male police officers asking me  questions about a man who had broken into my house.  A man who had raped me.   What if he had killed me?  I asked for a policewoman and another woman to be  present during my questioning.   I fought and shouted  and cried and would not answer the questions the  police asked me.   It seemed an hour or more, but they  finally complied,   in the presence of another woman, I  thought, I could answer anything within reason.  If a woman survives the physical trauma of rape, her  emotional reactions can take many different forms.  Sometimes she cries or screams, her body trembles;  some women are almost rigidly composed; some smile  inappropriately when they are answering questions.,  There is no set response when a woman has been raped,  as there is no set time for eventually coming to terms  with it and beginning the recovery period.  LATER  It takes a long time for the soul to heal. My  physical pain, the bruises on my body eventually  disappeared, but my inner being still hurt, like a too-  long open wound.  When I walk to my class at night I remind myself  that the footsteps behind me are probably students  who attend classes in the same building.   The  friendly bus driver is just that - as friendly to me as  he is to everyone else that rides on his bus.   He is  not going to follow me home I tell myself.  At four a. m. my son woke me to tell me I had  been screaming.   I have awakened some nights  drenched with sweat; my heart pounding so loudly  that I could hear it.   Sometimes I cry, for no  apparent reason.   Sometimes when I am sitting and  reading, tears come, but I don't realize I am crying.  I have moved my work space to the other side ot  the room so I can see the hallway and the door to  the room.   The light isn't as good, but I compensate for natural light with another fluorescent lamp.  I keep a careful routine with the dog - when my son  and I are both away from the house, she must be inside.   When I am home alone, I no longer take her  outside to the back yard.   I am still startled by noises  I hear inside the house; for awhile, even the furnace  turning on made me watchful.   For a time, I was  afraid to be in my house and afraid to be outside. I  wanted only to hide in my bed and pull the covers  over my head.   And sleep.  Sometimes when I close my eyes, I can see the  face of the man who raped me.   Other times, I see  a glint of sunlight on the knife he held. For a time,  I gave my thoughts over to whether or not I should  have fought back, but I know there is nothing I can  undo now.  I have been seeing a psychiatrist for several months  since the incident.   She told me recently that I appear  to be healing some.   I told her that I keep the radio on  all night so I can hear music when I wake in the middle  of the night, and not be so alone with my thoughts. The  music soothes me although it is something I never did  before.   I have started to occasionally sleep through the  night without waking and being afraid.   Three nights in  a row now I have slept through until early morning.   But  tonight, I am writing this at 3 a. m.   Tonight I have not  slept at all.  I look for the time when I am not as frightened as I  sometimes am now.   I think I may never be less than  wary, even in my own home.   I wonder if there is any  man who can understand what it is like to be subjected  to such honor. I wish there were words in the English  language to describe what I have felt, and what I feel  now. I wish I could find answers--answers for other  women. At best I find many answers: teaching women  to protect themselves, teaching the police to take us  seriously, revising the criminal codes. The time is  long overdue for us to change our cultural conditioning, to remove the anti-female, sexist elements in  whatever guise and to rid ourselves and men of the  ideology of rape. Until that time, my tears are for  all women, everywhere.   The man who attacked me was never found.    Aziza   the   Beloved   The Second Half Of  My First Century  by ELAINE HESS  Cairo, Egypt  Aziza was not always called Aziza. Her given  name was Ayusha, which is the common word for  thong or plastic slipper. So she gave herself what  she considered to be a more appropriate label:Aziza,  the beloved.  But in terms of how the village society views her  and in regard to treatment from men, her given name  has been the more apt.   Ayusha, the cheap and replaceable, was usurped after nine years of marriage.  Four children, the household furnishings that made  up her dowry, even her clothes were expropriated  by wife number two. Ayusha, the discarded slipper,  went back to mama and papa carrying only her handbag.  And a good measure of that self-esteem which had  led her to rename herself. Determined not to be a  kept woman, Aziza went to work as a seamstress in  a public sector Israeli garment factory. She acquired  skill and pride as a manufacturer. She resisted and  continues to resist family pressure to marry again.  They want to get the old shoe off their hands. But  she says marriage is worse than prison. All a woman  can expect from it is food and drink. No love, no  outside activity, no stimulation. Every day Aziza  prays,  Lord, show me a solution to this dilemma.   Every day, too, Aziza writes the numbers from one  to ten so she can learn to read the  Ingelizi  (English)  measuring tape.   But Aziza cannot even read Arabic.  She is illiterate. Next month, however, 30 year-old  Aziza will go to school in the afternoon. She wants  to learn to read and write. Aziza is dear, at least,  to herself.  Editors note:  Elaine Hess is a volunteer working under the Men-  nonite Central Committee, the relief and development agency of Mennonite churches in North America.  She and her husband, having formerly served as English  teachers in Cairo and Upper Egypt, are now living  and working in the Sinai town of el-Arish. She is  directing a needlework project that had been operated by the same agency during the Israeli occupation.   MCC Egypt assumed responsibility for this  project in May of 1979, the time when Egypt regained sovereignty over the region.   Her work puts  her into contact with hundreds of women in North  Sinai.  INDIANAPOLIS WOMEN'S CENTER  THE ONLY INDIANAPOLIS  CLINIC LICENSED BY INDIANA  STATE BOARD OF HEALTH  Pregnancy Testing  Termination To Ten Weeks  Counseling  5626 E 16 - -   -353-9371  Call toll free 1-800-382-9029  by MARY ROSE STROBEL BEAVIN  Last month I became one-half of a century old.  As a child it was difficult to fathom being that old.  Why, I thought, you might as well be dead  Well,  50 I am and dead I'm not.  fm finding out that this is as good an age as any  and so I'm happy to be 50.   I've earned my wrinkles  and crowsfeet.   My blonde hair is winging gray at the  temples.   No pretending I'm 39.   People would only  say,  My, she looks OLD for 39.    I thought about telling people I'm 59 but they  would only say,  My, she looks well preserved.    I'm no pickle so guess I'll just tell the truth.  We all have to be someplace and the middle of my  first century is a pretty good place to be.   Life is great;  it has to be.   We get only one life on this good earth.  This day is the best day I have and whatever season we are  are in is my favorite season.   It's now time to welcome  the October years of life.  Being 50 is a time to journey back to childhood  memories, ever mindful that they can no longer  be lived, only remembered.   Living is for today  and if we are lucky, tomorrow.   I appreciate the  golden harvest of past adventures I was able to reap.  As an adult there were days of magnificent, unspoiled  dreams;many realized, some not. There was the inexplicable joy of having a new life placed in my arms,  the bittersweet feeling of children growing up and moving away, and the satisfaction of striving to do some  good.  In spite of being a depression baby, I was fortunate to  be born into a family who loved and respected life.   My  parents taught that life isn't easy,but you can make it  better if you try.   That was a lesson well worth learning, and I remember it frequently as the years roll by.  At 50 we are older but somehow newer.   Life changes  rapidly in so many ways.   The past is only a foundation  for the future and the future is where we must set our  sights.  I heard it said of a woman,  Life defeated her long  before she died.    I hope someone will say of me,   She lived long after she died.    Somewhere on the chalkboard of time, if only for a  moment, I hope that something I have written will seem  to someone like sunlight on a cloudy morning, a cold  drink on a hot day, a featherbed in winter, the whisper  of love, or the clasp of a friend's hand.  To all who have 50th birthdays this year, try to remember, each day is a new adventure, maybe better  than the last.   Make the most of it.   It is unique and unrepeatable.   Happy Birthday to us.

Equality   of  rights  under  the  law  (.hall  not be denied or abridged by the United  States   or   by  any  state  on  account  of  sex.  Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to  enforce, by appropriate legislation, the  provisions of this article.  Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two  years    after    the    date    of    ratification.  Author of:   Alice Paul  Year introduced into Congress: 1923  Years passed by Congress:   1972 (this took almost  50 years)  Deadline for ratification:  March 22, 1979. (h  took 72 years to get the right for women to  vote.   It took a Civil War to get Black men  included in the Constitution.  Indiana passed the ERA. It was the 35th state to  do so. But because this is a federal amendment, it  will not apply anywhere in the country unless a total of 38 states ratify it. Then it will become part  of the U-. S. Constitution.  In a recent major victory for ERA advocates, the  House Judiciary Committee voted to extend the  deadline three more years.   This was a compromise  since ERA proponents have asked for a seven year extension.   The Committee also voted that states cannot  rescind their ratification.   Experts believe the    decisions will easily pass the House.   Passage in the  Senate is expected to be more difficult.  The Constitution says nothing at all about time  limits for ratification of proposed amendments.  Deadlines are a new practice.   The first 17 a-  mendments and the 19th amendment (Women's  Suffrage) were added without any deadline for ratification.   The Supreme Court says Congress may  assign any  reasonable  time for ratification of an  amendment.  Time has become the strongest weapon for opponents of the ERA.   Repressive forces in unratified states have used stalling tactics and political  deals to block ratification.   Idaho, Nebraska and  Tennessee voted to reverse their ratification.

Washington, D.C. 20515  big sisters  n  How can we hope to break the chain of events  that leads pre-delinquent girls into early and often unwanted motherhood, prostitution, drug and  alchohol abuse, if there are no agencies to help  them... when they are growing up?  In an attempt to answer that question, Big  Sisters of Greater Indianapolis was established  in 1974; their specific purpose to  match   young girls with adult women volunteers and  encourage the one-to-one friendship that results.  To date, 428 cumulative matches between Big  and Little Sisters have been established and nurtured through the Big Sisters agency in Indianapolis.  Through the friendship that develops, a Little  Sister will often be able to cope with her future  problems when the adults one-year committment to  the program has ended.   Just as important, such a  friendship often introduces her to a social and economic world outside her own realm of experience  A Big Sister can often provide assurance that  there are careers and opportunities available to  women today that are worth the work and study it  may take to obtain them.  Little Sisters are referred to the agency from  several sources: by teachers, by family and by the  Juvenile Court system.   Big Sisters come to the  agency as volunteers.   They are from diverse  backgrounds.   They are 18 and older (no upper  age limit).   And there are never quite enough of  them.  Currently there are 90 potential Little Sisters  who need the services that only a woman volunteer  can provide.   The Big Sisters agency can give training, support and encouragement from their professional staff of caseworkers and administrators, but  the bottom line is always you... the woman, the  volunteer who cares.  For additional information about the Big Sisters  program in Indianapolis, please contact the agency's  headquarters at 615 N. Alabama Street, Indianapolis,  Indiana 46204, Phone 317-634-6102, Monday-Thursday 8a.m. to 5p.m., and Friday 8a.m. to 12 noon.  If you do not live in or near Indianapolis and you  are interested in this program, be assured that there  is probably an agency near you.

This is one of the reasons  there is so much coverage in this issue about the  Amendment and about die July 9th March on  Washington.  If passed, The Equal Rights Amendment will i  have an effect on all women--everywhere.    If it  doesn't pass, there will be such a negative effect  on all women--everywhere--that to try to imagine  it is impossible and degrading. Failure to pass the  ERA will mean that this nation has gone on record  as being opposed to full equality for all its citizens.  Women will continue to be second class citizens.  DID  YOU KNOW  THAT:  For every dollar a man earns, a woman earns  only 570.   A female head-of-household earns less  than 2/3 of what a male head-of-household earns,  and this gap is widening.  Women represent only 2  of the total secondary .  school principals, although they comprise 63  of the  public school teachers.  Women college professors earn, on an average,   3000 per year less than men college professors.  Without the Equal Rights Amendment, what  little non-discriminatory legislation there is can  be reversed, modified, or even eliminated.  If you believe in the ERA, make it a priority  this year.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 3  Pilgrimage  ington, D.C.  X*  o  i  On the Capitol lawn, 90, 000 assemble  In 1913, 8, 000 people, wearing white and carrying purple, gold and white banners, marched down  Pennsylvania Avenue toward the U.S. Capitol in  support of the Women's Suffrage Amendment.  On July 9, 1978, 65 years later, they were remembered by approximately 90, 000 people, dressed  in white and carrying replicas of the early suffragist  banners.   Making up the largest feminist parade in  history, the procession marched toward me U. S.  Capitol.   They marched in support of the Equal  Rights Amendment and the extension of the March  22, 1979 ratification deadline.  The Girl Scouts led the way from the mall adjacent to the Washington monument.   Women,  children and men followed, marching in unison,  a tightly disciplined array.  An antique trolley carried the handicapped and  elderly. It was dedicated to the memory of Anna  K. Wiley, an original suffragist who was jailed in  1918.  Blanche Austin,  an 86-year-old suffragist from  Pennsylvania rode the txoUey.    She once served as  personal secretary to Dr. Alice Paul, author of the  ERA.  A pony cart carried  Children for the ERA,    including Lori Smeal, ten-year-old daughter of  Eleanor Smeal, national president of the National  Organization for Women (NOW) which organized  the march.  One marcher wore a purple pin that had belonged to her grandmother, a school teacher  who had fought for equal rights.   Another wore  the petticoat of her suffragette mother.  One elderly woman, D.C. resident, Katherine  Heath said,   I've been fighting this battle for  30 odd years.   That's why I'm so decrepit, I  can't walk.    I had to meet them here,   she  said as she stood on the sidewalk and watched  the parade pass.   Occasionally she joined in  the  ERA now  chants or raised her fist in  support.  Several area bands, dance troups and a  mime group enlivened the march as it  stretched from the Washington Monument to  the Capitol and the numbers kept coming.  Many participants sang songs, including the  traditional  Bread and Roses,   a verse of which  follows:  As we come marching, marching, we  battle too for men, For they are women's  children, and we mother them again;  Our lives shall not be sweated from birth  until life closes; Hearts can starve aa well  as bodies; give us bread, but give us roses.  Another song was sung to the tune  of the   Battle Hymn of the Republic  and included the  lines,  We will tell them that 200 years of waiting is too long, we will have ERA.     We must show the legislators that women must  be written into the Constitution,  said Ann Mattar,  a marcher from New York City.    I don't care if  the woman is Asiatic, Black or disabled like myself,   she added as she waited for her delegation  to pass before wheeling her wheelchair forward  to join them.  As the procession passed beside the National  Archives building, each delegation paused.  They cheered and applauded the huge banner  stretched across the steps:  Equality of rights  under the law shall not be denied or abridged  by the United States or by any state on account  of sex.    Women dressed as suffragettes solemnly  after the largest feminine march in history. Many newspapers underestimated the huge crowd.   We assumed we would have the ERA without  any difficulty, but that was a mistake,   she  added.  and proudly displayed the Equal Rights Amendment banner.  It was at that site sixty-five years ago that  Alice Paul's march in support of women's suffrage ended in disruption.   The peaceful marchers were spit upon, slapped, kicked and burned  with cigar butts when a group of irrational onlookers aroused the crowd to attact the suffragists.   The city police turned their backs.  The 1978 marchers respectfully paused here  and then continued on, sometimes chanting  One,  two, three, four, we need three more (states to  ratify), five, six, seven, eight, Congress must  extend the date.     We shouldn't have to ask for a ratification.  Our rights should have been granted 200 years a-  go,   said ERA backer Susan Witheroe of Fayette -  ville, Pennsylvania.   I have no respect for a process that has denied  me my rights for 200 years,   said Susan Lock-wood  of Indianapolis.    She said the ERA is really a question of human rights and expressed regrets that it  must now be a political question.   Her four-year  old daughter, Ashley, seemed disappointed mat  so many children marched,   I thought I'd be the  only one  she said.   A number of families marched  together.  Nancy Sutton of Indianapolis said it was  thrilling  to see thousands of women from all over the U.S.   sharing her views.    It gives me support for my own  thinking,   she said. She brought along her nine-  year-old daughter Stephanie.  Over 325 organizations were represented in  what one policeman called  one of the best organized marches in Washington history.    Delegations included not only national contigents, but  also regional, state and local groups   They represented major political parties, feminist groups,  labor unions, professional organizations, civil  rights groups, educational organizations, civic  groups, and religious denominations.  One of the most geographically diverse delegations was the American Association of University  Women which had members from every state present.   National Negro Women and Pan Asian Pacific Women were also represented.   Student groups  from colleges and universities such as Vassar,  Princeton, and Wellesley took part.  The Gray Panthers, an activist organization for  older persons, sent a delegation.  A group of scientists, engineers and women  miners which included staff from the Bureau of  Mines marched.   Union participants included the  AFL-CIO, AFSCME, the American Federation of  Teachers, Communications Workers of America,  United Auto Workers, Hospital Workers Union,  and the International Ladies Garment Worker's  Union.   The National Federation of Business and  Professional Women and the National Council of  Churches also showed their support for the ERA.  Several distinguished speakers were on hand to  address the huge crowd gathered on the Capitol  lawn.   We must be prepared for a very long haul.  We will work this summer like we have never  worked before.   We will march into history, Mrs.  Schlafly.   Wherever you are, eat your heart out,   stated Rep. Barbara Mikulski of Michigan.   She  also said a  highly organized minority  has been   allowed to stop the will of the majority.     We need an extension of time to fight the lies  about the ERA,   said Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman.  (D-NY).    It is a fulfillment of the American  Dream and not a threat to anyone.   Time is on  our side and we will win.    Others who spoke at the rally included Patsy  Mink, President of Americans for Democratic  Action and former Congresswoman from Hawaii;  Midge Costanza, Assistant to President Carter,  who brought a  message of support from my boss.    Feminist author Betty Friedan, Ms .magazine  editor Gloria Steinem, actresses Jean Stapleton  and Mario Thomas, and Co-Chair of the National  Advisory Committee on Women, Bella Abzug  were other notables present who addressed the  multitude.  A fund raising event in the evening featured  appearances by celebrities and an auction  or ERA-related items.  On Monday, July 10th thousands of ERA  supporters lobbied Congress for the ERA Extension Resolution.   We must not leave Washington without  having a firm commitment, yes or no, from  every member of Congress,   Patsy Mink told  the marchers.   And if they dare to turn us down.. .we will  turn them out on the next election day.    As the ERA activities came to a close the  charter planes, buses, cars and trains started  their trips home.   They were loaded down  with ERA supporters who had personally delivered their message to Congress.  Some left wearing buttons that said  ERA  --The Battle's Not Over   and others left  singing,    We will have ERA    By NANCY SCOTT  Is equality in her future? (Photo by J. LaFourest)

        <pagetext>Page 4  WOMANKIND  Continued from Issue V.  Women in Soaps  by MARY CRISLER  Frank and Anne Hummert were two Chicago advertising people who decided to set up a radio production  company to broadcast daytime serials. They did not  write the scripts, but originated the general theme of  each show with a brief outline for the first six months.  They introduced a number of serials, including  The  Romance of Helen Trent  and  Ma Perkins.   Elaine Sterne Carrington, who was a successful  magazine writer, began writing  Red Adams  for nighttime radio in 1932. The show was renamed  Pepper  Young's FAmily,  and rebroadcast in the daytime. Her  other daytime successes included  Rosemary  and   When a Girl Marries.   There have been many other writers of soap operas  throughout the last 50 years, but the preceding were the  first and were instrumental in making the programs  successful and able to continue to the present time.  DURING AND AFTER WORLD WAR II, the radio  soaps flourished. In the early 1950's daytime television  threatened the radio serials. For ten years, radio and  television shared serial listeners. However, on Friday,  November 25, 1960, the last four remaining radio serials  ended and TV took over.  Scenes from the early TV serials took place in kitchens  and living rooms with conversation over coffee cups.  The problems were related to marriage, children and  family. The situations were real to the housewife of the  50's for she was prepared to identify and suffer along  with people who seemed to have problems much like  hers.   The soaps are exactly what we want them to be. They  provide us with a world we long to visit and revisit; a  vision of life we long to believe. They are our group  daydreams. And day after day they unfold their secret to  the viewer; we need not be extraordinary to achieve a  life of extraordinary intensity and fulfillment,  said  Madeleine Edmundson in an article in Newsweek entitled  Confessions of a Soap Addict.   Television soap women are portrayed as multi-  talented, often far more intelligent than the men in their  lives. They are able to change jobs easily. A number of  women are employed as part-time, non-professional  workers. When a woman is recovering from a conflict  with parents, a divorce, a rejection, or a death, the  prescription is for her to get a job. The place of employment will be in a doctor's or dentist's office, or in a  restaurant or nightclub, where she will be available for  other characters to confront or advise. This portrayal is  to give encouragement to the viewers, especially those  who may have suffered a similar conflict, and to tell  them that if they will become interested in others, their  own problems will not seem so disastrous.  SOAP OPERAS PROVIDE AN ATTEMPT to find  meaning in individual lives, and it is from this that the  listeners become interested. Many people see unhap-  piness and suffering as the central theme of soap opera.  This is not really the main characteristic, but sustained  anxiety certainly is. Soap opera people study and talk  over decisions, and worry about the results of their actions. The energy expended on these decisions reflects  the characters' beliefs in the importance of the individual life.

BOX 16306  INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA  46216  Some people protest the soaps' view of women as  always preoccupied with personal emotional problems,  since these are supposed to be the traditionally feminine  concerns of the old-fashioned, unliberated woman. They  claim that today's woman should be shown engaged in  careers, budgeting their money, and otherwise meeting  the challenges of equality.  The serials' messages are that the only life that can  bring happiness is of the heart   or emotional commitment to other people. In a book calledl From Mary  Noble to Mary Hartman, the authors state,  Soaps tell  us that the problems men have traditionally confronted,  to succeed or fail, are unimportant, superficial,  irrelevant to the central concerns of life. Satisfaction is  simply not to be found by anyone in the traditionally  masculine pursuits. Far from suggesting a double standard, or a division of life into male and female  specialties, soaps utterly reject conventional masculine  values, holding up conventional feminine values in their  place as the only desirable standard.   Are soap operas true to life? Evidently some  viewers believe they are, as attested to by the following  letter which a medical doctor wrote to  General  Hospital:   I'm a doctor and I want to congratulate you  on your authenticity. But it's that real-life quality of  your program that's making my job harder. Every time  one of your characters contracts a new disease, dozens  of my patients call me to make sure they're not suffering  from the same disease. I've had to insist that some of  them stop watching the show    In the Soap tradition, this Series is continued.  Pilgrim Afoot  There is a psalm  footsore  heartweary  that must press on;  that plods  and pulls for breath  measuring the marvel of the day  against the weight  of death;  and now with spring swelling  for love of the giver  bargains willingly:  one night of rest, of easing pain  and mourning over  I take the road again.

A Letter  Of  Protest  His Excellency, The Ambassador of Japan  Mr. Fumihiko Togo  2520 Massachusetts Ave., N. W.  Washington, D. C.   20008  Sir:  Indicative of the cultural level of a nation is its  treatment of helpless creatures.   To slaughter  dolphins is as barbaric as the slaughter of any  other innocents.   If they could be herded to shore  for the slaughter, they could have been herded  out to sea, away from your fishing grounds.  To defile their bodies after the slaughter, wasting flesh your people consider edible, compounds  the enormity of the crime.  One citizen cannot do much, but I shall never  willingly buy a Japanese product until your Government rescinds its bounty on dolphins.  Yours truly,  Pat Watson  This letter was written in response to a newspaper  article about the needless slaughter of helpless  dolphins. This incident happened several months ago.

KERSEY  A Movie Review byroberta  LYNCH  Saturday Night Fever  The lines are still forming every weekend and  it's still hard to go to a party without getting into  an argument about it--so maybe it's not too late  to add my two cents to the Saturday Night Fever  fever.  On one level, I think it's a terrific movie. A  simple plot, but at least it does have a plot.  Some good characterizations.   Great music.  Electric dancing.   Dramatic moments.   Pathos.  Happy ending.   You don't get many movies like  that these days.  And on another level, it's a good movie.   It's  a film that takes seriously the dreams and dilemmas  of a young working class guy.   It looks clearly and  sympathetically at his life--the kind of life that seldom makes it into America's cultural big time.  In this respect, SNF is at its best in communi -  eating the subtle and complex ways in which our  options are limited--not just through a lack of  jobs or education or opportunities, but through  narrowing our horizons and keeping us locked within our own particular world.  There is a certain kind  of satisfaction in being the local disco king.  Even when Tony does look for options there aren't  very many.   That's why I disagree with the critics  who complain about the film's conclusion because he  ends up leaving his roots and becoming the kind of  awkward transplant into middle class society that his  girlfriend, Stephanie, represents.   I think that's actually a pretty realistic resolution for a sharp guy who's  clearly a leader in his own element, especially since  the film doesn't give us any kind of guarantee that he's  going to make it.   It might be that we'd rather see him  organize a union at the paint store, but that certainly  wouldn't be any more plausible.  But there is something that disturbs me, even on  this generally strong level of the movie.   It's the  question of what particular truth a filmmaker chooses  to reveal.   Take the Manero family.   Why is it that  film after film can portray deep conflicts in middle  class family life, while still showing the participants  as multi-dimensional human beings.  Yet as soon as a working class family appears on  the screen stereotypes take over.   Although Tony's  brother Frank is at least given some complexity, his  parents are cardboard figures, with little vitality or  appeal.  I have no doubt that there may be working class  families that are just this narrow.   But there are also millions of others that have considerable energy,  love, humor, and savvy.   Is it too much to expect  that Hollywood would attempt to reflect these qualities as well?  Maybe it is.   And maybe we should just see SNF  as a step in the right direction and leave it at that.  That's what a lot of people I know are saying.   I  can't agree, though.   Because there's a final level  on which this film is as bad as anything that I've  seen lately:   It is very sexist.

It is increasingly out of vogue to discuss  the matter in such bald terms.   These days women  are urged to look at the complexity of things   which  is sort of a polite way of saying  aw shut up, enough  already.    But I'll stand by what I said.   I know it was sexist  because I have this highly developed, sophisticated  technique for spotting sexism.   Fortunately, it's not  centered in my brain which is sometimes a little  ach.   It starts out just as a little knot.     I can get a -  knot from lots of things--like reading statistics on  battered women.   But it can get worse.   And in Sat-  urday Night Fever it got worse.   I actually startecTto  feel something like a pain every time that Tony's  sometime dance partner, Annette, came on the screen.  Now I've heard all the complicated arguments  about how Badham, the director, was portraying  sexism in its most blatant forms in order to expose it  or about how Tony really reforms and shows that sexism is wrong when he agrees to be friends with Step -  hanie.   But I don't buy them.  The basic attitude that pervades the movie is one  of consistent contempt for women.   And what disturbs me is not just that Badham chooses to portray  men's attitudes so badly, but that he chooses to portray women in such a way as to rationalize such  treatment.   Annette almost seems to be asking for it,  as the saying goes.   There are plenty of strong, even  tough, women who frequent neighborhood discos, but  none of them manage to even flit across the screen in  this film.  Even Stephanie, who is supposed to be a more independent character, is portrayed as slightly ludicrous in  her attempts to be something that she's not. I've seen  at least half a dozen reviews (all by men) that complain  that the movie isn't convincing because how could such  a dynamite character as Tony fall for someone as silly  as this woman.  Tony is the film's hero.   Everyone is encouraged  to identify with him.   And he basically shares this  attitude of contempt.   Re may agree to be friends  with Stephanie, but its only minutes before on the  screen that he coldly tells a miserable Annette that  she's now a cunt--after she has sex with his friends  in a kind of desperation.  He doesn't take that back .  And since he never seems to sleep with Stephanie, we are left with the same philosophical  pronouncement on women that he made early  on in the film:   they are either nice girls or cunts.  It's not much to take home with you.   And that's  what worries me--what people take home with them.  I saw that movie in a theater of over 1, 000 people,  and I must have been one of about 10 in the crowd  over the age of 25.   It would take a lot to convince  me that those teenagers--already deeply entrenched  in standard sexual patterns--saw that movie as anything but a reflection and affirmation of those patterns.  To say this doesn't deny the movie's power or  positive aspects.   But it does imply that in order to  really be able to look at the complexity of things,  we have to recognize that they can have contradictory aspects.  There is a disturbing tendency of late to portray  feminists as narrow-minded moralists or cultural  elitists.   The movement has sometimes been guilty  of failing to be sensitive to different life experiences  or values--and this needs to change.   But at the  same time, women need to avoid the tendency  to fall back into sweeping our gut reactions under the rug in the name of tolerance.   Saturday  Night Fever may be a boon for disco music, a  welcome depiction of working class life, and a  fun evening for almost everyone; but it's still  bad news for women.

See article on  Niles)  On July 8th two busloads of women from Indiana  left from Indianapolis to take part in largest march  in the history of the Women's Movement.   The women who boarded the buses were not average.   In  fact, it was the first time I had encountered so many  independent and assertive women.   Their robust humors  and affable personalities transmitted pure boundless  energy.   Each was a cameo of strength.  The twelve-hour journey allowed for many interesting and fortifying conversations.  One auburn-haired woman with buttermilk skin  and transluscent green eyes sitting next to me voiced  her complaints against the male-dominated system .  She told me that she had been tried for the first degree murder of her husband.  To preserve herself and  her four children, she'd mustered her anger and retaliated.   The most miraculous fact was, thanks to  the testimonies of friends and neighbors, she was a-  quitted.   Finally, at the age of thirty she'd won. She  now has control over her own life.  A lamentable flat tire gave our bus members an  opportunity to talk with other women who were usually out of earshot.  At this interlude I chanced to meet a woman who  had raised a family and was currently raising her consciousness.   She'd gone back to college to receive her  masters in Psychology and had managed to take a Women's Studies course.   Change is not impossible.  Further down the road we stopped at a lettuce-less  burger bin.   The air was moist with recent rain and a  yellow hue shaded a verdant hillside.   In this insect  quiet calm I noticed a tanned, smooth-skinned grandmother with the wisdom of an Indian woman etched on  her face.   She stood statuesquely holding a baby nearly  a year old.   The infant's tortoise brown eyes were intensely direct in contrast to her blossom softness.   I  asked a woman nearby,   Whose baby is that?   She replied transforming the infant into an individual,  Thats  Alice Paul.     Shivers echoed through my senses.   The  title was a tribute to the woman who introduced the  ERA to Congress in 1923.   This child would carry the  name for another generation.  The movement is composed of mothers and daughters and grandmothers.  Much of my own involvement with the Women's Movement occurred during my earlier years at college.  Across the aisle from me were two young women from  Bloomington who were about to begin their college  careers.   Untapped resources.   Future catalysts.   Fortunate to be -Embarking upon their careers with a  broader perspective as individuals, they have escaped  the post-high school stereotype of stuffed animals and  padded bras.  If all career-minded women could anchor at a feminist port during their final stages of development, we  would have more successful women in the world, and a  better world.  When we arrived in Washington at 3:30 a.m., at  least three hours late, a handful of women from Virginia NOW were there to greet us and offer some of  us their homes for the duration of the stay.

Niles)  Many women departed  more conducive to feminism than they themselves were  socialized with.  Strong mothers breed even stronger daughters.  The next morning the streets of D. C. were teaming  with women, children, and men dressed in dazzling  whiteness.   Buttons, banners, and booklets colored the  scene as friends recognizing friends went running a-  cross sun-baked streets to embrace the zeal of each  other.  Smiles radiated more energy than the sun.   Tears  of happiness ebbed in the eyes of many women as they  realized that they were not just a handful of women  striving for equality, but that they were represented  over one-half the population of this country who  were asking for justice.  By three o'clock on that hot afternoon, an estimated 90, 000 persons had marched along the 1. 7  mile route to the Capitol with every sinew straining  for equal rights.   The humidity and intense sunshine  provoked thirst and heat exhaustion for many of the  women.  Women soaked their clothes in fountains and rushed  to friends with water that penetrated deeper than the  skin.   It was wondrous to walk through the crowds and  witness the awesome inspiration and the brimming  tears as women listened to the most stimulating voices  in the Movement.   Although the sun was taking its  toll on the bodies of these who had marched, cosmic  camaraderie was ultimately the refresher.  By five o'clock people were wandering off to waiting buses, yet spirits were sustained in the countenances of many.   The streets were ribboned with buses  from all over the country.   Many participants stoically stood with stone-still eyes, silently recording  the awesomeness of the day.  The women who left on Sunday departed with rays  of streaming optimism.   The women who stayed to  lobby left in dispair.  Many anti-ERA and undecided legislators were  unwilling to recognize the need for a Constitutional Amendment. (Could it be they fear the legislative paperwork the passage will entail, more than  they fear not being re-elected?)  Fatigued women boarded the bus back to Indiana.  Yet sparks of energy still floated through the bus:.  It was time to revitalize.   A large unified step  had been taken, but the destination was not yet  in view.  Upon returning to Indianapolis the Indiana de-  elgation scattered like comets to their beds.   As  they vanished no words were spoken.   Sincere  and solemn parting smiles were wearily exchanged.  With the energies of each no longer visible, I  slept during the last stage of my journey, on a regular passenger bus to South Bend.  The Washington March was a chance for women  to demonstrate to the legislature their desire for  the ERA. By participating in the March I have recharged my energies with the hope of energizing  all of womankind.  I believe that the current of the Women's Movement cannot be broken.   By sharing our strengths  and spreading our ideologies we can enlighten all  of womankind thereby ending the darkness of inequality.  JOELLEN   VARGA  Others Speak Out  Alice Paul is a genuine shero.  WJLMA SCOTT HEEDE  Some battles can be won by a single, courageous  act.   Others take time, determination and grit.  Equal rights imply equal responsibilities.   I believe  mutual respect and genuine sharing to fight for values  of a true community will give people more dignity  and respect.   Often the world tells us what we are to  be and shapes us by the ends it sets before us.  We need ERA because Alice Paul and many other  famous women aren't even mentioned in the textbooks.   The sooner people realize that women deserve a place of honor in our past, the easier it will  be to accept women as full-fledged partners in our  future.  I am a teacher and I see boys saying,   That's  girls' stuff    It's getting better, but we have a long way to go,  and without the attention of the ERA it probably will  slip backwards.  My concern is that many, including myself like  the excitement of rallies and marches, but won't  remain dedicated to the cause when we return  from Washington.   As you march I would like you  to think of this as just a beginning to sharing women's concerns.    We are just beginning to learn to  fight political battles.   We need continued support.  Think---what can YOU do after our return from  Washington?  MARY K. GRAF  Clearly, the ERA is as vital as when originally introduced in 1923. Debate on the amendment continues; support remains strong; and the  condition of society has not changed in any way  to decrease the need or importance   for an  Equal Rights Amendment.  ELLIE SMEAL  This is not just a rally, but a reunion of old war buddies. Let the Congress listen.   We are here, we are  Americans and we will not be denied.  MARLO THOMAS  Today we embark on a journey to our nation's  capitol.   In the spirit of our foremothers, WE ARE  going to Washington to demand that our representatives in congress and our senators extend the deadline on ERA.  WE ARE going to Washington to honor the memory, spirit and dedication of Dr. Alice Paul, author  of the ERA.  WE ARE going to Washington.  Some of us have gone before.   Some of us now  feel the need to demonstrate our commitment  loud and publicly for the first time.   But we will  go to Washington again and again until our equal  rights are guaranteed under the Constitution.  Regardless of the outcome this year, we will continue to fight for the rest of our lives and our daughters' lives if necessary.  Catholics for ERA were among the religious  groups   represented.

Support Our Advertisers   fUOfUW the  Ironing Board  by PAT HEIDENREICH  My Son,  The Note Writer  This morning I was clearing off my desk when I found  it, another note. It was on the back of a grocery store  cash register tape. It read:  I am in love with my Mom  and Dad.  There was a little heart drawn after the word  love.  I smiled and my heart warmed. That kid may be rotten, but he sure is a good note writer. I got the box from  the closet shelf that holds my note collection and before I  dropped in the new one, I sat down and read them again.  EVER SINCE HE WAS ABOUT SEVEN he has been  leaving notes in strategic places for us to find. They are  all printed laboriously with pencil in a large childish  scrawl. Even though the spelling is atrocious, the  meaning is clear and I treasure them. Some are very  plain with just the words  I love you  and perhaps a  heart drawn around them and others are very fancy with  much decoration and lots of X's and O's. Most are signed   frum your son . Some are directed personally to Mom  or to Dad.  Since this kid has a knack for getting into more trouble  than Peck's Bad Boy, he spends a large amount of time  grounded to his room. During some of those times he  sent paper airplanes sailing into the living room from his  doorway. On the airplanes were printed love notes. Of  course, being an old soft touch, I would shorten his  'ground' and ever since then his Dad has been rather  suspicious of the love notes. Usually he asks, after  reading one,  wonder what he's up to now?  This  always irritates me. How could he suspect that darling  sweet boy of being a con artist? Besides, sometimes the  notes would come when he wasn't in trouble...(that we  knew of.)  I remember one time he sent a very beautiful paper  out from his 'cell'. It was covered with hearts, flowers,  X's and O's and said  I love you Mom  six times. I read  it and called him to come. We talked about how we were  sure he had learned a lesson and wouldn't kick his sister  in the stomach any more and I gave him his freedom.  Although I usually insist the kids put away their own  clean laundry after I fold it, this day I decided I would  help the little dear out and do it for him. I noticed a  crumpled paper on his bed. I was throwing it into the  wastebasket when I saw that it was another note, identical to the one I had received a little earlier. Except this  one said  I hate you Mom . I stuffed it into my pocket  and later opened it and thrust it in front of his face.   What's the meaning of this?  I demanded.   Oh, I made a mistake on that one..I meant love,  he  said as he hugged me. I knew he'd have a good explanation, the little darling had just made a mistake...  After all it's got to be a pretty good kid that sends a  Valentine to us that read:  Roses are red, vilits are blue,  no one is as sweet, as both of you. frum your son .  And he can't be all bad when after getting into trouble  again, I yelled  what makes you act like that?  and he  answered,  probably the same thing that makes me love  you so much.   Anyway, even if he does try to 'buffalo  me...I love it   Available in an Autographed  Collection  HOT OFF THE  IRONING BOARD  .  0 includes postage  PAT HEIDENREICH  R.R. 1,  Box 259  PAT HEIDENREICH Whitestown, IN 46075.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 9  Red Dancing Shoes  By J.C. STARKER  And far away it is, this memory of the red dancing  shoes, pressed between the years before and since. I was  six, just old enough to hold onto what I heard and saw  and lay it away like a changing leaf. Crinkled now, worn  brown in my time. Fragile, too, these forty-odd years  later, needing to be handled with the gentle touch of  someone who loves it.  We lived at the head of the hollow in the mountains in the  coal camp of Whiteblossom. Black stockings, I wore, held  up by elastic. When the elastic broke the stockings would  slide to my ankles.     'HERE COMES SALLY WITH the grease on her  chin...  My father would sing while he held me on his  knee. A miner he was for most of his life...two fingers  lost between loaded coal cars. In the evenings when he  came home from the mines he would be black with the  dust and he would smell of damp and coal and he would  be heavy with something called tired. We used a pan in  the kitchen to wash ourselves. The water from a well,  well water heated on the cook stove.   Light the lamp, Rae. Your daddy'll be here directly.   He would wash his face and his hands and come to eat  supper with darkness falling from him and away.   Lordy, Lordy, Whew,  my mother in the lamplight, her  black hair not left hanging to her waist. She was twenty-  two and wore her hair tightly wrapped around the back  of her head like a fat dark sausage. And I was there,  watching with those black Weiss eyes. My father would  read from the Bible in the lamplight.   Let them praise his name in dance: let them sing  praises unto him with the timbrel and harp...   The pieces of this memory, gently I touch them,  carefully I separate them from all my others. They fall  together out of place, each wanting attention in this year  of my searching through these years.  The baby on my mother's lap. Two boys and I then  before the other six came. The long table with oilcloth  covering. Was it checkered or was it filled with flowers?   There's a candy pull over at the Stidham place  tonight, Rhetta,  my father says. And the table is full of  biscuits and homemade syrup and potatoes and beans  and thick salt bacon slices and cornbread. And was it?  At one time it was all there.   PASS YOUR DADDY THEM POTATOES and quit  jumping up and down,  she says to me and my brother.   Thought maybe we could bundle these youngens up  and go on over.    Rae, you hush up that squealing, we ain't going. I just  hope you see what you done working these youngens up  now right in front of them they won't hush now them  wanting to go and I ain't said I was going and I ain't  going over there.   Turnip greens and big chunks of sweet onions we had  on the table, and maybe fried eggs with thick gravy. You  could mix the gravy and eggs and the biscuits, all of it  good.  IN THE SPRING WE WOULD PLANT enough so that  in the summer we could pick vegetables out of the garden to eat standing right in the garden if we wanted.   Go down to the store and git me a couple of pounds of  sugar to cook them berries in.   Down the mountain, along the dirt road to the company  store.   Ma says to put it on the bill.   All of it belonging to those who owned the mines. I  didn't know until later my father paying for it all on five  dollars a week. From morning until he came home with  his tired at night, six days a week, I never knew.  Walking down through the trees that smelled of Heaven  to me, that hugged me to them. And the table...  THAT SAUSAGE HEAD LEAVING the table to run into the back room with the baby. Angry eyes, taking their  own tired with them, away from the table. Squealing  from me wanting to go because they might dance at the  Stidhams. My father angry, too. A little fun. A little fun  at twenty-three and three children with six more coming  soon.   I wanna go, I wanna go.    Hush now,  my father saying.  We'll talk her to it  yet.   Two rooms in that far-away house. Mellow sounds forty-odd years old. I love you black-eyed people with dancing souls.   I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WEAR I ain't been  out of this house in months there ain't no use talking I'm  not going and you just go ahead I don't even have any  shoes I don't even have any shoes to wear over there.   He is gone to dance and I am crying because I hate her  with no shoes and we cant have any fun at all and he  went without us. There are shoes, thick shoes with  broken soles beside the bed. They bring us wood and  water from outside and they can dance, too, if she will let  them.   SHOO FLY, DON'T BOTHER ME. Shoo fly, don't  bother me...   The music would come on a fiddle or guitar or maybe a  harmonica. Everyone would dance even the babies held  in laps would be jiggled.   Rae, you hush that crying and git your brother's coat  on him. We're going to git your daddy.   Broken soles, angry eyes going to the dance. And there  is a fiddle. Somewhere there was. And they are dancing.  My father and one of the women there. And they are  laughing. All of them laughing with the holes waiting for  them in the hills to swallow them up and spit them out  with five dollars a week already swallowed by the company store. But I don't know that yet. But I remember  that well. So clearly it burns my eyes with just seeing it  so long after his feet have come to rest. His dancing feet.  Dancing still, surely dancing still.   Froggy went a courtin', he did ride, took Miss  Mousey by his side...   Rough overalls with white shirts, feedsack skirts and  dresses, old shoes passed down as some children grow  out of them and other grow to fit because shoes are as  costly as jewels.  SHE GIVES ME THE BABY, her that is so angry  that her heavy, tired shoes thunder across the floor  toward him. His ear between her fingers as though he is  a child...pulling him from the room. And I can hear them  laughing at my father and his wife who pulls his ear to  stop his dancing feet. He comes so quietly away with us.  That, too, seeing that, inside me, so surprised, it is  bright even after this long time, it remains.  There is silence in our house. I am ashamed for us all  because she will not let us dance. Or was it that?  And then it was the morning after silence that he left to  go into debt for the girl with the black hair hanging to  her waist who wore it tightly bound. I watched...I am  watching him come back to us, something beneath his  arm that he carries to her from the store. And when she  opens the box they lie like bright rubies   two shoes   red  dancing shoes for her.  application  you may ever  nave to make.

        <pagetext>Page 10  Janet A Feminist  Says Janet  pKACO  WOMANKIND   It's true that I have not been politically active  in the past, and feminism is a political activity. I  feel I owe a debt to the women's movement and feminism.     I'd like to get involved, and I haven't yet. When  I take the first step it will be to campaign for the  Equal Rights Amendment.    Janet Guthrie, who placed 8th in the 1978 Indianapolis  500  Race, qualified and participated in the  1977 Race, and attempted to qualify in the 1976 Race,  realizes it may be time to pay some dues to the women's movement.  Janet knows that 10 years ago, women were not  allowed in the garage area of the Indianapolis  Speedway.   For the 1978 Race, Janet had trouble  getting a sponser and says she gets letters from  other women drivers who complain of the same  problem.  After placing in the top ten of Indy's 500, Janet  appears more confident of her future as a race car  driver.   She is proud of her racing career and points  out that she also finished 12th in the Daytona 500,  10th in the 1978 Atlanta 500 (after qualifying 23rd  in a field of 40) and also won a half-mile stock car  heat at an Odessa, Missouri track.   She was in the  top dozen of NASCAR races 10 times.  'Janet A Joke/  Says Al Unser  When complaints (like those of Al Unser's--  the  poor  winner ofthel978500) surface,  Janet seems to rise above them.   She rarely disparages anyone.   One wishes she had in Unser*s  case.  The big-time, three time 500 winner was  angry when Janet predicted she could run in  the top five some day.   With sour grapes  spilling from his mouth, Al lambasted her  driving ability and agreed with his brother  Bobby's philosophy that  there's no way a woman has the stamina or makeup to drive hard  enough to win in USAC.    Janet, a 40 year old, ex-physicist, has won  the admiration of women, men, and children  the world over.   She has evidently not won Al's  admiration--but does she need it?  Abortion,   The   Law   and   the   Right to Life  Movement  This well-researched article began in Issue IV, was continued in Issue V and ends in this issue.   If you desire back issues - 1. 00 postpaid each.  THE SUPREME COURT DECISION in Roe vs. Wade  affirmed the conditional right of privacy to women in  their individual control of their bodies and procreative  processes. To allow the passage of the constitutional  amendment proposed by the Right to Life movement  would effectively permit the states to nullify a woman's  right to privacy now protected by the First, Fourth,  Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution. Futhermore, it is conceivable that state might  adopt highly restrictive abortion laws which could effectively outlaw the most efficacious methods of contraception such as the IUD and birth control pill by labeling  them as abortifacients. The result would be the condemnation of American women to a choice of less than effective contraceptive measures such as  rhythm,  compulsory pregnancy or celibacy. It could very well result  in placing a burden upon the courts of making medical  judgments which would be beyond the scope of their  right of the physician to give medical advice and treatment in accordance with his medical knowledge,  professional standards and obligations and his conscience.  The, Right to Life movement gives much verbiage as to  the  rights  of the fetus and the equality of the unborn  but they fail to consider the rights of women and the unwanted child and their rights of equality and to a quality  of existence that should be guaranteed and protected by  law. It is no secret that feminist organizations have  diligently worked for abortion rights for women but this  should be regarded as being in the natural order of events and not used as a rationale to place abortion in the  realm of an illegal demand being made by  a deviant segment of society. Margaret Sanger stated in  Women and The New Race,  No woman can call herself  free until she can consciously choose whether she will or  will not be a mother.  Equality for women in other areas  of our society are meaningless if they are not allowed to  control their own procreative functions.  CONSIDERING  THEIR  RELATIONSHIP  to  the  Catholic Church it is not surprising to find that the pro-  life movement would fail to consider equality for  women. For centuries and up to the present day the  church's all male celibate hierarchy has maintained an  oppressively patriarchal, discrimantory and sexist code  of theological law regarding women. Their hypocrisy is  most evident when one considers their position on abortion and contraception in relation to the fact that they  extoll the virtues of celibacy for an all male hierarchy  thereby preventing potential births and approve  just   war, capital punishment, and killing in self-defense.  What is surprising in view of their veneration of the  life of the unborn child is that they continue to promote  the myth that the unwanted child does not exist in our  society. To refute this myth one need only to turn to the  news media to know that we have a severe problem in  our society concerning abandonment of children and the  on-going physical and mental abuse of children.  Psychiatrists have determined that compulsory  pregnancy not only may be harmful to the mental health  of the mother, but also to that of the child. If we are to be  forced to approach the law in terms of morality what  possibly could be more immoral than the destruction of  a child's spirit and feeling of self-worth which is often  the result of bringing an unwanted child into this world.  As Erik H. Erikson, the psychoanalyst, most succinctlv  stated,  The most deadly of all possible sins is the  mutilation of a child's spirit.  Few things can be discerned that are more detrimental to a woman's spirit, the  spiritual growth of a child and the serenity of life within  the family than for a child to be born to a mother who has  been forced into motherhood without love or need. The  quality of life provided by a society for its citizens is a  justifiable interest of the law but such a law as promoted  by the Right to Life movement would only serve to reinforce the inequality of women and children and reduce  the quality of life for many to a sub-normal existence.  EVEN THOUGH THE PASTORAL MESSAGE of the  National Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1973 advised  Catholics that  no one is obliged to obey any civil law  that MAY REQUIRE ''abortion,  abortion is not a matter of requirement by law. It is a matter of choice according to one's individual conscience and as along as it is  safeguarded as such as are our other freedoms and  liberties it will not become an instrument for abuse of-  power. The arguments of the pro-life groups can be  recognized as specious when one considers the fact that  all liberties and freedoms can lead to an abuse of power  if not held in check by the safeguards of the law and  social responsibility. Abortion in the context of being a  matter of individual conscience cannot be construed to  be an avenue to social engineering in the form of  genocide, infanticide or population control of unwanted  minorities but rather the last resort for pregnant women  when all else has failed. It is impossible in a just society  to use the law to justify compulsory pregnancy par-  ticulalry in cases of rape and incest. The last thing a  woman who has been raped wants is a daily reminder of  that horrible event and contrary to the assertions of the  pro-life groups the trauma of rape quite often encourages pregnancy by bringing on ovulation rather  than preventing it. The number of pregnancies caused  by rape cannot be accurately determined since many  rapes remain unreported.  If we as citizens allow the pro-life movement to use  their strong-arm tactics to change the laws so that abortion becomes illegal in every case we will be allowing  them not only to impose their theological doctrine on our  society contrary to our constitutional guarantees but we  will also be denigrating those very concepts of freedom  and equality that we have purportedly based our society  upon. We will return to a social climate that encouragees  breaking of the law and reinforces criminal activity for  women will continue to seek abortions. Abortion is and  will be a universal phenomena and it has been premised  that it is impossible to construct even an imaginary  social system in which no women would ever feel compelled to abort. Law has not extirpated abortion in the  past and it is most unrealistic to suppose that it would in  the future.  Contrary to the arguments of the pro-life forces if an  anti-abortion constitutional amendment is passed it will  not reinforce the moral fabric of our society but rather it  will have a devastating effect on both our moral climate  and legal system. In addition to promoting disrespect  and disregard for the law, it will reinforce the  discrimination against the poor and women that already  exists in our society. It could, in fact, promote the  cheapening of life in our society for contempt for the law  can easily evolve into contempt for the right of others  and ultimately into contempt for human life. Furthermore, it would hardly promote their concept of sexual  morality for contraception is readily available even if  abortion is not. In addition, abortion is not primarily a  result of sexual immorality for a high percentage of  women who seek abortion are married and have become  pregnant as the result of the conjugal relationship. It is  particularly repugnant that the pro-life forces would use  the law to enforce compulsory pregnancy as a sanction  against extramarital or premarital sex. Creating life  must be seen as a spiritual and emotional gift from our  Creator not as a means of punishment under the law for  transgressing against the moral concepts of any one  religion or group.  THE moral issue of abortion is insoluble under the law  for it is a matter of religious philosophy as to when life  and personhood begins and not a matter of biological or  legal fact. As a question of morality it must not once  again be subject to criminal sanctions but left to the individual conscience. If left to individual conscience, the  choice for abortion would be open to all and those persons who found it repugnant to their morals would not be  compelled to regard it as an option but they would not  have (and should not have) the law to reinforce their  moral principles. The only apparent solution that is  seemingly equitable is the availability of abortion to all  women without legal sanction with physicians retaining  the medical right of refusal as with any elective surgery.  This would require no change in the constitution but  would be governed by existing medical law. Surprisingly, the most succinct statement as to what the  role of the law should be in the matter of abortion has  come from a Roman Catholic priest, Robert F. Drinan,  S.J., who said,  A system of permitting abortion on  request has the undeniable virtue of neutralizing the law  so that, while the law does not foribd abortion, it does not  on the other hand sanction it   even on a presumably  restricted basis.   Parenthood is a fundamentally important matter to  our society and its well-being. Therefore, it should not  only arise out of the personal freedom of the individual.  When it does not the results are not conducive to the  well-being of society as a whole. The importance of  parenthood in our society insists that abortion be seen as  a viable solution for women who are burdened by an unwanted pregnancy, but it is also vitally important that  society utilize abortion with care and social responsibility. In conjunction with the availability of abortion  we, as a society, must take positive steps to insure that  the need for abortion is substantially reduced. This can  be done by providing support services for responsible  family planning including contraceptive and abortion  counseling, providing child care centers for women who  work to support their families or choose to pursue a  career, providing sex education to the young, and, most  importantly, by upgrading the quality of life for the underprivileged and developing a society in which the  equality of all citizens is recognized. These are valid  areas in which the law may operate to insure that a  responsible choice is made. If we do not take the  necessary steps through the law and social relationships  so that abortion is not used indiscriminately but is  always the result of responsible choice we may find that  abortion has replaced contraception thereby justifying  the fears and propaganda of the Right to Life movement  and vitiating the humane spirit, practical wisdom and  courage of the Supreme Court decision of 1973.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 11  From Prison: She Pleads For Justice  To Whom It May Concern,  Since my incarceration at Indiana Women's  Prison, I have written all people I thought who  would be able to help me in any manner.   I am  sure after reading my letter you will understand.  If there is any way possible that you would be  able to help me in any manner ---I would be  eternally grateful.   I do not mind my actual  name nor the contents, be used in any way,  that will benefit me, for all I have said is  true.   Thanking you in advance.  Sincerely,  Jenna Kelsie  Indianapolis  My name is Jenna Kelsie.   I am from Evans-  ville, Indiana.   I have been convicted of 2nd  degree murder and I have been incarcerated at  Indiana Women's Prison since November 22, 1976  with a 15 to 25 year sentence.  I feel my constitutional rights have been violated  as there was more than substantial evidence, which  proved I acted in self defense, which far outweighs  that of the state.   The state's evidence was unreasonable, arbitrary and unsupported by fact.  This is my story.  I was married to Dale Graham for four years,  the last two years I resided with him in Boonville,  Indiana, his hometown.   During this time I suffered  from this man's brutality time and again.   I started  to become aware of his violent nature after shortly  returning home from the hospital after a hysterectomy    Dale beat me.   I left him at this time, but  relented and returned to him after his apologies  and promises.  During the last six months I lived with him,  I  was under constant pressure from him.   I was not  allowed any freedom without threats as to what he  would do to me.   He said he would tie me up and  let snakes crawl on me, kill chickens and let blood  drip on me or sew me up with hog rings.    These  were among many threats of cruelty he made to me.  Only a deranged person would say or do this.   He  shot at me in town and threatened me with a gun  on several occassions.   He beat me and pulled me  about by my hair many times.   He kicked me in  the stomach, spit on me, called me filthy names,  tore my clothes off, and threatened to kill me.  The separation which led to our divorce happened  after he intentionally threw a transmission onto a 16  year old nephew of mine causing him to lose the end  of one of his fingers.   During our separation, I was  harassed daily by the women he was involved with,  his friends, and himself. They phoned and came  to the house.   For protection, I began carrying a  gun after Dale assaulted me on a road, taking his  truck and banging against my car until he succeeded in pushing my car into a ditch.   He men took an  iron bar out of his truck, beat on the car trying to  get in and threatened to kill me.   The damage to  my car was estimated at a little under  1, 000.00  I did have a restraining order and called the police  many times for help, but no matter how much I complained, nothing was ever done.   I tried repeatedly  to get him to seek psychiatric help.   His family admitted they knew he was in need of it but refused to  offer assistance.   They made statements to others  that they did not doubt I was telling the truth, that  they knew how he was, but they were Hell-bent on  my conviction.  We were divorced September 28, 1973.   One week  later on October 6, when the accident occured, I was  at a place that I had every right to be.    Dale   forced entry into my car and began an assault of biting and beating me, which led me to believe my life  was in danger.   I screamed, pulled, and tried to get  out of the car.  Dale reached over and grabbed me  around the neck.   He tried to bite my right eye out.  I had teeth and nail marks around both eyes and on  my right arm.   He was like a maniac, all over me,  beating me.   I got hold of the gun and I shot him.  In a few seconds I realized he wasn't beating me anymore.  Support H.J.

She and her children had suffered from his  cruelty.   Other  friends  of Dale's testified as to his  violence and erratic behavior.   Dale who weighed 225  pounds and was 6 feet 2 inches tall also carried a deadly weapon.   I am 5 feet, 1 inch and weighed 130 at  the time of Dale's death.  The courts did not instruct the jury properly upon  the decisions of verdicts.   The jury was never informed whether or not murder in the 2nd   degree  was higher or lesser than manslaughter or vice  versa.  A special prosecuting attorney who was not duly  qualified nor duly elected, but in the hire of the  deceased's family, took the lead in the trial over  the elected prosecuting attorney.  There was also failure of the court to have the  jury impose the sentence after returning the verdict, where jury must state in the verdict the punishment to be inflicted when the jury finds the defendant guilty of murder.   Trial Courts refused my  attorney the right to instruct the jurors in layman's  terms of right to self defence, so it could clearly be  understood a person has a right to protect his/her life.  I contend the state was prejudiced and failed to  produce clear and convincing evidence beyond  a reasonable doubt.   I happen to be a victim of  circumstances.   I am not a criminal.   I had no  criminal intent, not ever.   I am a pawn of our  judicial system, a woman who has suffered the  traumatic experience of having to defend her  own life.  6352  PLACE   TOEWOrMrtt  touching.

WOMANKIND  is a most impressive  magazine and we are very pleased to  make it and your acquaintance.  It would be wonderful to have material on WOMANKIND for our display  tables.   Do you have any fliers you  could send?  With best wishes,  Sincerely,  HANNELORE HAHN  The International Women's  Writing Guild  New York, N.Y.  I am an 18 year old feminist who  was fortunate enough to join the  Indiana NOW buses on their journey  to Washington.   The trip home gave  me a chance to read your magazine  and it was quite an inspiration.  The entire trip was.  In my case, inspiration led to  poetry, so enclosed please find  several poems written on the trip or  shortly thereafter, which you might  consider using in WOMANKIND.  I would be very pleased to contribute to your wonderful magazine.  Thanks and love  MASIKA BLADES  Indianapolis, IN;  (See page 5.)  You are to be congratulated on a  most attractive paper.  Pax,  SALLY RICKERMAN  Women's International  League for Peace and  Freedom  Philadelphia, PA.  I sincerely want to thank you and  all the staff for allowing me to be  heard in your paper.   My thanks go  out to all who have recently become  concerned with what has happened to  me and to all those who are offering  their support in each way.   My gratitude goes out to you all.  Sincerely,  JENNA KELSIE  Indianapolis,  IN.  (See page 11.)  I enjoyed reading the two copies  of WOMANKIND and also meeting  you at the last Penwomen meeting.  It's good to see a publication which  covers all sides of controversial  issues (as in  Forum on Abortion.  )  I am enclosing a check and wish  you continued success.  Sincerely,  ANN LANCE BRANDY  Carmel, IN;  Since becoming a housewife and  mother last year, I've been looking  for a magazing to read that keeps me  in touch with my sisters.   A friend told  me about your publication, and when I  saw the subscription leaflet at IUPUI  (several months later), I grabbed it ho -  ping it was the magazine .  Well, here's my subscription, and I  can't wait to read it, anything other  than Redbook,  Cosmopolitian or American  Baby   I am 21 years old, going to IUPUI part-  time while my husband David finishes his  unuergrad work in Science.   I am presently  a sophomore pursuing a degree in English.  My seven month old daughter, Erika also  keeps me very busy with her newfound exploratory powers and crawling expertise   Sincerely,  KARLA ASHMORE  Indianapolis, IN.  I enjoy your publication immensely.  I have on my desk this morning a  copy of the second issue of WOMANKIND with an article on Gertrude  Stein I want to read and Jo Starker's  short story.   Allegra Stewart is a  lovely and learned lady and I know  the article must be fascinating.   I  somehow must have misplaced this  issue when I received it.  Best wishes,  SUZANNE SCOGGINS  Cumberland, IN.  I am writing to you sincerely hoping  that the publication of this letter will  help promote The Woman's Movement  as I feel this is one of my last chances.  My name is Carol Ann Wilds.   I am  22 years of age.  On August 18, 1977 my husband  came home drunk and was beating  me up. I was six months pregnant  at the time with my first child.  I shot him to protect myself and  my baby.  I was arrested for first degree murder and on October 28th a jury convicted me of second degree.   I am  here serving a 15 to 25 year prison  sentence.  I am fighting once more, the  second time in seven months for my  life and the life of my child.   I feel  the public needs to be aware that a  great injustice has been done and I  am hoping with all my heart that  people will realize that I am not  the only woman who has been treated so unfairly by  The Man's  judicial system.  While sitting in this cell I know in  my heart, had any one of you women  who is reading this now, had been in  my shoes the night of August 18th.,  you would have done the same thing.  Therefore for your freedom as well  as mine... Let's fight.  CAROL WILDS  Indianapolis, IN.

On my 45th birthday, I brought a miracle  home from the hospital. My son Paul was only  four days old, but he and I and our family  and WOMANKIND had already been through a lot  together.  After a dry spell of 20 years, the shock  and joy of being pregnant began to soak in.  After the amniocentesis results were in, and  after things began to look like we were to be  blessed with a healthy son (ah, modern  technology,) we,my husband, my 21 year old  daughter, and I braced ourselves for the  changes this creature would make,and was already  making. During this time, WOMANKIND was forced  to find a new location, in a time span of 10  days, and then we had to move, and then clean  and fix the place up (and it was an awful  mess ) Emotionally and physically, I was  drained. Yet, the prospect of having my second  child solaced me and gave me hope. I felt  there was a reason for this baby. A purpose...  perhaps his mission in life would be to unite  two families, to give love to all those around  him, and to brighten the world a bit. He  certainly would grow up differently, given his  set of circumstances,...and he would stand a  good chance of being a true male feminist.  In a gift poem, Martha Eubanks calls him,   small Paul, Apostle to the 21st Century.  I  wonder. And worry. But, for now I am caught  up in the wonder of him and these past six  months. It is not as easy as it was when I  23...  ycud. Cfiris-tcpk r Stewart  pCttS jCugor Ca?r uxt C  Sent, cj WCLUam   .

Even with all the problems during my pregnancy, I felt like I was holding so much  love within my anatomy that nothing else could  go wrong and when I went to press with Issue  23 on Sept. 27, 1982, age 44 and almost six  months pregnant, I knew I had overcome all that  had been put before me in the way of pain  and prejudice and impediments. I was elated  and after leaving the printer, I hurried to  a maternity shop to purchase some much needed  clothes. Then it was back to the office at  3447 Washington Blvd. to make sure all the  machinery was off, clean up the paste-up mess,  and make a list of the things that must be  done while the paper was at press. It was a  long list and I'm just now beginning to check  off those tasks that were supposed to be done  that week.  But, to that night...  At this birth, my daughter and my husband  assisted me as loving coaches and WOMANKIND  photographer,  Katie Niles,  recorded the  event in black and white.    At home,  my daughter  and husband share the diapering and the rocking  with me,  but it is still difficult to find  time and energy and space for WOMANKIND.    But  Contents  Womenews 2  At  Carnegie  Hall  3  Record  Review  9    Fake  Women  9  Fiction  7    Verse   5  Exp Jana tion  Before I stepped out from the lighted  landing of my basement office, I scanned the  parking lot as far as possible. Working since  I was 15, I had learned early to be cautious.  Now I was even more so. There was a maroon  and white car parked near the edge of the lot,  but it had been there all day. I exited and  quickly locked the door. Outside, as I walked  the 15 feet to my old green station wagon,  I enjoyed the early evening autumn air. It  soothed my flushed face. It had been a rough,  but wonderful day.  What a lovely springlike night,  I thought.  WOMANKIND was at  press, I was six months pregnant, all was  right with my world...   I slid into the car, locked the door,  and adjusted the seat to make room for my  stomach.  Too bad we don't have a tilt  wheel,  I was thinking as I pointed my key  towards the ignition. .  And then I heard running footsteps. A  black man was beside the car. His wild-eyed  face mouthed incoherent words as he furiously  tugged at the door handle. Something glimmered  in his other hand. I shouted at him:  Go  away  I'm not alone. There are people in the  house   He put something in his belt as he  bent over. I wanted to blow the horn; I wanted to get away,  i'm six months pregnant, I  thought, This can't be happening to me...if he  shoots me...the baby...will die.  I bent my  head towards the ignition. And then the night  exploded and warm blood cascaded over my face.  I knew immediately what he had done: he  had picked up one of the large black stones  that border the sidewalk and he had heaved it  at me. I was bleeding badly; I wanted to pass  out, yet, I was clear-headed. I realized what  might happen to me and my fetus if I lost  consciousness.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Ms Meg  by bulbul  Woman  for  V.P.  of  U.S.A.  A nationwide campaign for the nomination  of a woman Vice-Presidential candidate for  the 1984 Presidential election     for  both major parties     was launched in the  July issue of the LADIES' HOME JOURNAL.  Myrna Blyth, the magazine's Editor-in-  Chief, urged its more than 18 million  readers to fill out a simple form calling  for the nomination of a woman Vice-  Presidential candidate for both the  Democratic and Republican parties, and to  return the form to the magazine's New  York offices.  Blyth says the JOURNAL will pass the  petitions on to the chairpersons of the  Democratic and the Republican National  Committees.   We must make our leaders aware that  the could-a-woman-be-President debate is  outdated,  says Blyth.  if both political  parties were to nominate a woman for Vice-  President during the same election, the  woman-for-higher-office debate would  immediately evaporate. Moters would not  be voting for or against  a woman,   but  for the individual they feel is best  qualified, and for the policies that  individual believes in.   Editor's Note: Why Vice-President? Why  not a woman for President? WOMANKIND suggests  Eleanor Smeal, the past president of the  National Organization for Women.  STAFF  Wmv  m;ih    EDITOR  Judith LaFourest  STAFF  E.K.

Female  Farmers  on  the  Rise  According to recently released Census of  Agriculture results, one in 20 U.S. farms is  operated by a woman.  Judith Kalbacher of USDA's Economic Research Service recently analyzed the results  of the 1978 Census of Agriculture to determine the number of women farmers. This is  the first time these statistics have been  available, since this was the first census to  publish statistics on the gender of farm  operators.  They reveal that women are the sole or  principal operators of 128,000 of the  nation's farms, just over five percent. And  the numbers are rising. U.S. Department of  Labor figures show that the number of women  working principally as farmers or farm managers doubled between 1970 and 1980.  Kalbacher postulates that the number of  women farmers are probably, in actuality,  much greater than these figures indicate.  Since the census reporting forms allow just  one operator to be named per farm, it's  usually the man that's named by most farm  couples even though the woman may share  egually in the farm work and management responsibilities. When a woman is designated as the operator, it generally means  that she is the sole operator of the farm.  Considering this, there's a good chance  that a majority of the nation's farms have a  woman as one of the main operators.  from EARTH NATION  The Clearing   Nashville, IN.

Insurance Co. for Equality  Consumers United Insurance Company  (CUIC) endorses the National Organization  for Women's (N.O.W.) nationwide protest  against sex discrimination in insurance.   The question is not one of actuarial  data, but one of dignity. This is not a  debate over equations. It is one, rather, of  equality,  said Robert T. Freeman, Jr.  president of CUIC.  Freeman emphasized that the issue must  be resolved on moral philosophical, and ethical  grounds:  All American citizens  should be treated equally. We should  have one experience table showing the  over-all experience of all Americans and  not one for Blacks, not one for women,  not one for different ethnic groups or  any of the dozens of other ways Americans  can be sub-divided on arbitrary grounds.   CUIC supports premium rates based on  all-American experience tables for life,  accident, health, and other kinds of  insurance. The deviation from the  standard premium rates should be based  on sound underwriting practices that  include factors like life and health  styles, smoking and exercise habits,  weight, occupation, and other personal  choices that directly affect mortality  and morbidity tables.  CUIC, the largest worker-owned and  worker-managed firm in the country already  offers life and health insurance policies that  conform to the proposed non-discrimination  legislation now before Congress and is the  only insurance company in America that has  testified in favor of the legislation before  subcommittes of the U.S. Senate and  House of Representatives.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  NOW   in   Indy  by E.K.  BRAMBLETT  Indpls, IN  At a press conference in Indpls, Eleanor  Smeal (L.) congratulates Judy Goldsmith,  the new president of N.O.W. (Photo by  K. Niles.)  The National Organization for Women  held its 1982 fifteenth National Conference  in Indianapolis, October 8-10, 1982 to elect  officers, to plot strategies for the defeat  of New Right candidates in November  elections, to assist candidates supportive  of feminist issues, to urge more women  into political activism, and to raise the  NOW membership to over one million before  1984 elections.  Judy Goldsmith, of Wisconsin, defeated  four other contenders for the presidency  and took office December 1. Goldsmith was  the previous national executive vice president.  Her closest challenger uas Sonia John  son, a Mormon excommunicated for her  beliefs and actions supportive of equal  rights and feminism. Goldsmith won the  presidency with 1,157 votes to succeed  incumbent Eleanor  Ellie  Smeal. Johnson  trailed Goldsmith with 705 votes.  Other officers elected were: Barbara  Tirnmer, Washington, D.C, executive  vice president; Mary Jean Collins, Chicago,  action vice president; Kathy Webb, Little  Rock, secretary; and Alice Chapman, Danbury,  Conn., treasurer. Collins and Chapman were  on the Goldsmith team ticket. Gloria  Sackman-Reed (executive vice president) and  Katie Harris (secretary) were also on the  Goldsmith team, but failed to get elected.  Goldsmith, 43, a former English professor, began her affiliation with NOW  as a chapter activist in her hometown  Manitowac, Wisconsin. She named North  Carolina senator Jesse Helms as  NOW's  number one target in 1984. He is the  point man for the right wing. We see him  as a clear and present danger because of  his stand on reproductive rights.   Efforts by NOW to increase minority  membership will increase during her term,  Goldsmith promised.  A proposed NOW Institute for Feminist  Politics will focus upon the recruiting of  a  new breed  of candidate,  it's frustrating,  Goldsmith said, to constantly look  at the lesser of two evils. We want to  support candidates we can really feel good  about.  She also stated that NOW would not  devote itself to the ratification of the  Equal Rights Amendment  until we change  some faces in the legislatures.   Johnson was unquestionably the most  widely known of the candidates, having been  the focus of much media attention when she  was excommunicated from her church, an  experience which is recounted in her book  From Housewife to Heretic. She also re -  ceived much publicity as the leader of  thirteen women who went on a 37-day hunger  (Continued to page 4)  MEG/CRIS  by E.K.  BRAMBLETT  Indpls, IN  Olivia Records, the pioneer commercial  production company of women's music, presented two two-hour concerts in New York  City's elegant Carnegie Hall on November 26,  1982 in commemoration of their tenth anniversary. Olivia co-founders Cris  Williamson and Meg Christian were the featured  artists.  In buses and taxis, and T-shirts and  tuxes, women from all over the world flocked  to the event. One group of four evoked  applause from the crowd, which clogged 57th  and 7th Avenues. They arrived     in full  tuxedo gear     in a horse-drawn, shiny-black  hackney carriage driven, of course, by a  woman in a black tux.  Following a brief introduction by Olivia  president, Judy Dlugacz, a troupe of nine supporting musicians took their places onstage,  followed by Williamson and Christian. All  were clad in black slacks, white shirts, and  bright purple acetate jackets.  The concert began with a fast, exuberant  song entitled  Anniversary,  a spicy number  congratulating Olivia for ten years' existence.  A clever lyrical arrangement employed the  titles of several of Williamson's and Christian's songs which fit appropriately into the  song's message. Christian beamed with energy  bouncing ceaselessly. Williamson, conversely,  appeared happy yet subdued, somehow out of  place without her blue jeans and headband.  Next came an only slightly altered version of Margie Adam's  Beautiful Soul,   which was given an almost ethereal quality  with the harmonic merging of voices, standard  instruments, and synthesizer. The soft music  and lyrics were made yet more moving by the  warming of the stage with red, orange, and  yellow lights.  Christian's songs dominated the first  half of  the concert, beginning with  Can't  Turn Back.  She then introduced     to a  great round of applause     the lively and  humorous  Look Within,  a song of  infinite  wisdom born of painful experience.    The Ones Who Aren't Here  had listeners nodding in agreement with the introspective and touching lyrics, obviously empathized  with by much of the audience. Beginning  with,  ...I'm thinking about the ones who  aren't here, and who won't be comin' in late...  it continues, ...1 wish I could know all the  lovers and friends kept from gathering, I  think of you now, the ways you could go,  we're all of us refugees...so let's have a  song for the ones who aren't here, for the  hate and the fear, for laughter, for struggle,  for life...so let's have a song for me and  for you and the love that we cannot hide....  Williamson and Christian bounced to center stage after a brief intermission,,  sporting long-tailed black tuxes and white  shirts- Christian accented her formal attire with blue Nike tennis shoes. (Nike  is the Greek goddess of victory.) As Christian was featured in the first half, Williamson was in the second.  Following a pause after her first number,   So Good, So Right,  Williamson dedicated the  second song  Soaring  to her mother. As  usual Williamson used her voice as an instrument, augmenting the other musicians and  nearly sweeping the audience out of their  seats. Susan Freundlich, interpreter  for the hearing impaired, gave perhaps her  most beautiful and involved signing for this  piece, not merely signing the lyrics, but  also choreographing them into a small-scale  dance which held the audience entranced.  Another of Freundlich's splendidly choreographed numbers was for  Texas Ruby Red,   which Williamson explained was  not a song  about a grapefruit, but rather about a wild  rowdy woman of the Old West in today's world.   Preceding her fifth number,  Light and  the Eye,  Williamson turned her back to the  audience, set down her guitar, and donned her  trademark blue bandana while mumbling,   You just can't take her anywhere...dress 'er  up nice and look what she does   The number was  dedicated to  the mother Earth, the greatest  woman of us all, and to all the great spirits  who have been in Carnegie Hall.   Williamson and Christian regrouped for   goldie oldie time,  singing a medley of  eight of their favorite songs. Alternately,  beginning with Christian, the audience heard  segments of such hits as  Turning It Over,    Joanna,   Ode to A Gym Teacher,  and  Waterfall.    If I Could Only Win Your Love,  a  swinging country style song, preceded the  final scheduled song of the concert,  Song of  the Soul.  The audience in the darkened hall,  was nearly glowing from the energy and vitality brought to a spectacular level by the  combined thrills of two Williamson/Christian  concerts. Thus hyped for that final song,  some women sat and tried to absorb one more  number as if to hold each note alive  forever;  others stood and stared at the performers to  retain their images, and yet others stood and  joined wholeheartedly in the celebration in  and of song, hands joined and raised and  swaying with the music, further savoring  every aspect of the concert and getting in a  choral  thank you  to the performers, Olivia  Records, and each other.  Responding to the loud and prolonged  standing ovation, Williamson and Christian  pranced back onto the stage     whereupon the  ovation became deafening mayhem. As an encore  they sang  Ain't No Mountain High Enough,   a song uplifting musically and specially  meaningful in its lyrical imagery for those  who heard it that night.  Background vocal and instrumental assistance was given by: Diane Lindsay, bass;  Jeanette Wrate, drums; Judy Chilnick, assorted percussion; Adrienne Torf, piano and  electric keyboards; Jackie Robbins, cello;  Linda Tillery, Vicki Randall, and Shelby Flint  on vocals.  y OiflK  I For  UJ/  A  Kfc  T     Available at,  Making Olivia's  10th Anniversary Concert  the album of our decade.

Johnson's campaign booklet noted numerous  television appearances and speaking engagements. Johnson, 46, considered abortion,  Lesbian rights, and  the Feminization of  poverty  as the top three priorities of NOW.  Advocation of  radical  tactics and  the apparent expectation of immediate solutions to old and complex problems was seen  by many delegates and members to be  likely to damage the solidarity and credibility   and membership   for which NOW  has strived and earned.  During the convention's second day  plenary session, delegates honored their  outgoing president of five years Eleanor   Ellie  Smeal, to whom was given a large  guilt made collectively by NOW chapters  in all 50 states. Jill Chambers, a spokeswoman for Indiana NOW, guipped that the  guilt was  proof that women in NOW, indeed,  can sew . Smeal also.received the Indiana  NOW Woman of- the Year Award. Later Smeal  and her husband Charles joined hands in an  enormous circle of delegates about the  perimeter of the Indiana Convention Exposition Center's main hall singing,   We will never give up  We will never  give in    Later, in a speech, Smeal warned  against and  idealistic  approach to deciding which political candidates should receive NOW support, reminding people  to  look at the total picture. Look at  where they (the candidates) sit in legislative bodies and at who would be there if  they weren't.    Remember,  stated Smeal,  that some  people are more egual than others in that  they can influence more than one vote.  Someone, with seniority may not be with us  one hundred percent on every one of our  issues, but she or he may be able to block  someone else with an atrocious position (on  NOW's issues).    it may be better , she added,  to save  a person with seniority than to back someone  with no seniority who is one hundred percent  behind us. I am very, very worried that if  we (NOW) follow a purist approach, that  road will lead to structural weakness and  power weakness.

WOMANKIND covered most of the events, but  because of limited space could review only a  few. (Past issues of WOMANKIND were distributed  at many of the programs.  Authors Nora Ephron, Gerda Lerner, and  Pauline Kael were the major lecturers for the  series. Elizabeth reports her observations on the latter.  WOMEN IN THE MOVIE MEDIA  by ELIZABETH MARIE F0D0RA  Indpls,IN.  Pauline Kael, film critic for the NEW  YORKER, spoke to a group of about 200 at North  Central High School, Indianapolis. The critic  was met with warm applause, which was then  interspersed throughout her talk, along with  amused laughter. The concensus of the audience  was overwhelming approval.  The unpretentious critic, clad in a  bowed blouse and black pants, was introduced  as  a woman in the vanguard of achievements in  the arts and the humanities in out time.  The  introduction went on to say:  With her film  reviews, she has helped shape the study of  cinema as an art form and as an academic  subject as well.   The reviewer gave her opinions, feelings,  and mini-criticisms about current movies.  Kael talked of the discrimination experienced  by women because of the movies of today.  Kael  said women are portrayed as  spunky, fiesty,  tough little critters  in movies as a solution to a problem directors have about integrating women into the action genre films,  that traditionally glorify male strength.   Right now successful women in films are  not making films called feminist,  Kael said.  She believes that most women are breaking into films  via the exploitation  route the same  way men have all along.  Kael says that women directors have a   women's sensibility as to how to represent  certain scenes in a movie.  A woman will  simply choose to use a camera in different  shots to  see things you haven't seen before.   For instance, says Kael,  in FAST  TIMES AT RIDGEM0NT HIGH directed by Amy  Heckerling, you say a young girl's reaction  to her first seduction, and her disappointment. The camera was kept on the girl's  face to see how she reacted. That was a scene  that a male director would never have  thought of filming.   According to Kael, the movie depictors  generally deal with sexual experiences  because that is what the public wants, but   there are all sorts of aspects of women's  lives that have rarely been on the screen.   There is a whole scope of art which the  directors and producers totally neglect.  Kael can be described as witty, humorous,  candid, opinionated, and intelligent, also   arty  and talented. One denotation, though,  that she does not appreciate is  controversial  and she tells why:  It is still  to you all.  necessary for a person who writes about me,  Continued to page 11  Judith E.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  The  Queen of  Arizona  Birth  The  Sick-Joke   Call her what you like behind her back;  laugh at her, but  when you go into her room  remember  that she is Queen of Arizona  and requires obedience.   That's all she told me as we made  our rounds.  Later, at the threshold of the room,  I halted at the sight:  the scrawny, old, old, woman,  grey, with fox-brown, glaring eyes  commanding me to  serve and recognize.   I am the Queen of Arizona,  she  intoned,  the last of my great family,  the rulers of the West.   In time she told me of her treasures,  her life's possessions kept within  one metal bedside drawer  next to the tissues:  his photograph, stained and crackled,  a silvered mirror monogrammed with K,  a ring, old gold and heavy, the  inscription worn to near invisibility,  two tortoise combs, deep-carved, still  elegant; a tiny silver box, which,  from time to time, she held, but  never opened. In the corner, a  testament, a small black  book which held addresses  and pressed daisies.  Spectacles.  Two strange stones.  I knew. She knew. But we had gone  too far.  So on she railed. Aides tread  with fear, interns with respect: they  brought her flowers from other rooms,  candy and magazines  which she accepted  as her due.  I stayed on the night they  brought the tent.  Her eyes defiant, she waved them  all away.   I am the Queen of Arizona,  she affirmed,   I do things on my own.  But  her hand trembled on the sheet.  Imperious, she struggled there,  fighting with every breath  until the stars outside her window  faded in the grey, and she,  at last, resigned her life.  They brought a small green  plastic sack for her effects:  the combs, the photograph,  the stones.  I called each  number in her book,  but none remained.  She was the Queen; the last  of her great family,  rulers of the West.  by B.F.  BALOG  Gary,   IN.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Jesus  and the Woman Who Violated the Sanctity of Life  by PEGGY BRAYFIELD  Charleston, IL.  Jesus was teaching in the temple when  a group of angry moral citizens brought  to him a woman who had aborted her pregnancy  They said,  Master, this woman is guilty  of violating the sanctity of life, for  she has killed her unborn child. We say  she is a murderess, and should be punished  accordingly. What do you say?   Jesus at first paid them no heed, bending  his head over a tablet and writing. But  when they continued to demand his judgment,  he lifted his head, slowly looked each  of them in the eye, and said,  You accuse  this woman of violating the sanctity of  life. I say to you, let him who is without  sin cast the first stone.   And he lowered his head and went back  to writing.  And each one in the crowd suddenly saw  in the eye of his conscience some violation  of the sanctity of life, for which he had  been guilty.  One man remembered he had arranged for  his fourteen year old daughter to have  an abortion, saying her case was  special,   because she was so young.  Another man recalled that he had pretended  to be unaware when his wife, a woman in  her forties, had decided not to burden  him with any more children (he had a heart  condition). She guietly aborted an unplanned pregnancy.  Another man remembered sadly how he  had abandoned his pregnant girl friend,  many years ago, leaving her to cope as  best she could; she had died of a self-  induced abortion.  A holy man and his wife thought about  how they had so impressed their daughter  with the sinfulness of unmarried sex, and  so sheltered her from the facts of birth  control, that when the girl became pregnant  out of wedlock, she preferred to commit  suicide, rather than turn to her parents  for advice and support.  Two prominent married men recollected  how they had paid for abortions for their  mistresses.  Others among them had condoned violations  just as grievous:  Two wealthy businessmen had polluted  the environment with toxic wastes, causing  an indefinite number of miscarriages, as  well as babies born with deformities.  Two lawmakers had opposed legislation to  outlaw such pollution, in the interest  of promoting free enterprise.  Two politicians had voted to cut expenditures for feeding poor children, and  to increase funds for tanks, bombs, and  missiles.  And most of those present had unguestion-  ingly supported their government in acts  of war, condoning acts destructive to innocent lives and to unborn babies within  the womb.  And so, one by one, these moral, male  citizens ceased their accusations and turned  away from the woman who had violated the  sanctity of life.  Now it happened that among the crowd  was one who had not sinned in this regard.  He was a non-violent pacifist, a man who  had unfailingly behaved with love and gentle  ness toward his neighbors. He had given  generously to charity and had never complain -  ed about the tax money spent on programs  for the needy.  Furthermore, he was an environmentalist,  a vegetarian, and an organic gardner.  Each winter he put seeds outside for the  birds.  He even strove to follow the Jesus's  most radical teachings, such as  Love your  enemies, bless them that curse you, do  good to them that hate you,   and  Resist  not evil, but overcome evil with good.   He, if anyone, was without the sin of  having violated the sanctity of life; he  alone among them might have condemned the  woman.  But, pondering ever the trials, injustices, accidents and weaknesses to which  any human being might be subject, he said  to himself,  There but for the grace of  God (Who did not create me female) go I.   And so saying, he too turned away.  Then Jesus, seeing he was alone with  the woman who had violated the sanctity  of life, turned to her and said,  Woman,  where are your accusers? Has no one condemned you?   She said,  No one, Lord.   Then Jesus said,  Neither do I condemn  you. Go, and as much as you find strength  within you to do so, continue to live in  reverence for the sanctity of all life.

Of course  I'm sure. I'd know you any where. I have  often watched you and have spent much time  thinking about you. I've thought about  your slightly watery, red-rimmed eyes.

You know  about it, too, don't you?  But tell me, old lady. How have you  survived the world? How have you come  to look with those eyes? Have you not  seen and felt the cruelty of life? Have  you not been wounded and crippled by those  you loved? Have you not felt the terror  of violence of the oppression of having  to survive alone...as a woman? What do  those eyes see that allows you to struggle  daily with your world?  Tell me, old lady. What does it feel  like to have those semi-crippled hands  carry that shopping bag? How does it feel  not to move ahead with the times of fashion,  technology, sexual permissiveness? Do  you feel lost and lonely? Do you wish  504 Sudberry Ct.

What prods you along  the street, hobbling along, stopping for  life-giving breath? Is it your need to  hang on to life? But then, why are your  eyes filled with calm?  Don't kid me, old lady.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  An Interview with Margie Adam  Eleven year old Elyssia McCormack and WomanShine Director Nancy Brooks interviewed Margie  Adam for WOMANKIND. Part I appeared in Issue 23.  by NANCY BROOKS  Bloomington,IN  I didn't even know how to use a microphone and I was really nervous. But I  knew that the only way I could get the  singers in the audience to sing my music  was if I sang out as strongly as I could.  I'd sung in church groups and school  choirs, but never seriously. I mean I  grew up in a family where my Mom played  the piano and my father was a songwriter,  but those were hobbies to their  real  work.  So although I got lots of reinforcement that music was important, I  never got that you could make your living  doing it. So the idea of taking myself  seriously as a songwriter was a big deal  at first. And then being up on the  stage, singing my music...well, I really  didn't think of that.  E: That was a big change   M: Oh yeah, it was.  And what happened to me  at that festival was that several performers came up and said:  You should perform your own music. Your songs are  powerful and we'd like to sing some of  them. But you also communicate your  own music in a way that's very compelling  And so I said,  Well, you know, I don't  want to have to change my shape.  I  didn't want to have to turn into the  women I saw on television: having to be  so much less than all their dimensions,  having some record company run entirely  by men defining out how women should look  and be presented, and what songs to  sing....having no control. I couldn't  conceive doing that.   Cause I didn't identify as a feminist  singer.  I didn't identify as doing  women's music. I didn't know I was doing women's music. None of us did. I  was just doing music. I was just writing  about the things that I felt strongly  about and noticing that an interesting  group of people were coming to hear me.  I was writing about the things that I  felt strongly about and noticing that  I was writing about a lot of different  things besides just love songs. And  the fact is, in my life, lots of stuff  goes on more than just relationships...  love relationships. I have to deal with  my fears. I have to deal with my anger.  I have to deal with a lot of stuff, just  like every other person does. And since  those things are real important to me,  that's what will come out in my music.  Like what you were talking about in  your lyrics. I had the feeling that  you knew what you were talking about.  E: Ummhmmm.  M: It has to do with what you feel. And  I think that an audience recognizes  when an artist is being authentic and  is telling the truth, as best she knows  it. Even though I feel like the process  of growing as a conscious woman artist  is, as Adrienne Rich says, a process  of refining truths. And in my relationship with my audience, I'm refining  truths we can tell each other. I really  am a product of the women's movement.

So I said,  i don't want to be a performer. I'll be a songwriter who shares  her music with whoever wants to come. I  didn't get an agent until three and a  half years into performing . In fact, I  didn't identify as a performer until  about two and a half years into performing when I'd done something like 52 concerts in a year and I had to say to myself,  Margie, you're a performer. It's  just that you're not performing in the  traditional model of performers. You've  developed your own.  And I really developed this by listening to what my audience said to me: we love that you don't  put up an act between yourself and us,  that you let us know how you feel about  your songs, that you talk about your  songs before you play them, and that  you move among us when you finish performing. I'm willing to be myself on  stage, and I can't imagine being any  other way.  E: You wanted to be among people.  M: Yeah, and I wanted to be myself. I  wanted to share my songs. But I didn't  want to have to hide myself to do it.  And so I didn't. And that is at the  foundation of my success. And the fact  that I've been able to continue doing  what I do and perform all over the  country...it's because I get to be myself. And it's because of the permission.  I've gotten from the foundation of my  audience, which has been women from the  very beginning. Not because I went out  and said,  I am a feminist singer.   There is an amazing moment that comes between  the end of a song and the beginning of the audience's  applause. I can hear a sigh from anywhere in the  room in that second or two of intense stillness.  Through that tiny opening, I feel a powerful stream  of energy flowing between the audience and me.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Lems' Love Offering  A Record Review  by SARAH JANE WILLIAMS  Greencastle, IN.  Kristin Lems has been writing the  songs of the women's movement for many  years. In her performances and in her  latest album,  We Will Never Give Up ,  recorded live, the talented composer/singer/  guitarist/ pianist abolishes the distance  between audience and performer, making her  hearers part of the action. Even the youngest can sing along, as in the enthusiastic  kids' chorus of  My Mom's a Feminist.   (Dad's a feminist too, let's note.)  The album leads off with the  Ballad  of the ERA.  (Judy Goldsmith, newly elected  president of the National Organization  For Women, is credited with help on the  vocals ) Written years ago at a time when  the Illinois legislature was thought to be  on the verge of ratification, it is more  timely than ever, with the reintroduction  of the ERA in congress. As Lems says, it  is not a guestion of whether, just of when.  The title song of the album,  We Will  Never Give Up,  is becoming the new theme  song of the movement. According to album  notes, Indiana's Jill Ruckelshaus supplied  some of the words, with music and additional  lyrics by Lems.  Failure is Impossible,   Susan B. Anthony's motto, originated in  Indianapolis with words and music by Eddie  Grogan, a NOW activist.  On side one, Lems solos in Peggy  Seeger's  I'm Gonna be an Engineer.  Opening the second side is a traditional  folk song,  My Mother Gave Me a Penny.  If  you remember the MS. magazine children's  story of Little X, you'll love  The  First Five Minutes of Life,  about the  couple who affectionately welcome  their baby child into the world, but postpone the determination  into which gender  the baby would grow.   The Witches Song   celebrates our anonymous foremothers and  reminds us that  There's a little witch in  every woman today    In a change of pace  Dangerous Spring,  with piano chord accompaniment rather than  guitar, is a passionate lyric lament for  lost love. Still another side of Lems'  talent is shown in  Kashke,  a Persian  message of universal hope and longing  played in an exotic syncopated rhythms.  This album is Kristin Lems' love offering to her friends.  I thought to catch  some of those moments (of the Spring of  1982) on tape,  she says,   and bring you  a record to celebrate your heroism, and the  sense that, while the road is long and  winding, we are together, and WE WILL NEVER  GIVE UP    Center  for  Women Policy  Studies  The Center for Women Policy Studies  (CWPS) is a feminist policy research  center.

        <pagetext>10  WOMANKIND  The  Hardest Part  by ANDREA SCHOENTHAL Wellsviile,NY.  Michael's tenth birthday was exactly  one week away. Evelyn wanted to write the  invitations with Michael's input of course.  She also wanted him to see all the party  things she and Lindy, his five year old  sister, had purchased earlier that morning.  Spreading the balloons, streamers, paper  hats, and favors, on the dining room table  in front of her, Evelyn sat down to get  to work.  She glanced over her left shoulder out  of the diningroom window. No sign of Michael  yet. She saw Lindy out there, jumping rope  with some of her kindergarten pals. Why  did she let Michael go to the creek to play?  He'd lose all track of time.  Grumbling to herself about her stupidity,  Evelyn pulled the Captain's chair closer  to the maple table and began to read through  the list of Michael's fourth grade classmates  Jennifer Larkin. She checked Jennifer's  name first. She was Michael's best friend.  Actually Jennifer was probably Michael's  only friend, if Evelyn were honest with  herself. Being honest with herself about  Michael wasn't the easiest part of raising  him.  Timothy O'Brien. She wasn't about to  have Timothy at Michael's party. The nerve  of Tim's mother, inviting every other boy  in the class and not inviting Michael.   After all, Evelyn,  Mary O'Brien had  said.   You know how your Michael is.   At eleven o'clock Michael finally came  home. He burst through the front door,  splashing water from the top of his green  bucket onto the braided rug. On his boots  was an inch and a half of mud.   Michael. Be more careful.    Oh, hi Mom. Want to see what I caught?   Plopping the bucket on the table in front  of her, he plucked out a crayfish, dangled  it in front of her face.   And I caught  two more crayfish and lots of minnows and  a newt too. I'll put the crayfish in a  separate bowl. They pinch,  he added.   Take off those muddy boots before you  go one step further,  Evelyn said.  Put  them on the porch to dry. Then go put on  your shoes. They're in your room next to  your bed.   Michael started towards his bedroom.   Michael.    What, Mama?    Your boots.  On the porch please.    0ops    Sorry. I forgot.    Well don't forget to come right back  in here when you're done.    Why?   Evelyn took a deep breath. Sometimes  dealing with Michael reguired an awful  lot of patience.   Your birthday party? Remember?    Oh that.

J/ Jhz Julian Cl nt x  1100 West 42nd Street  Indianapolis, Indiana 46208   17)923-9919    A Counseling Center for Women   A half an hour later Evelyn still sat  alone at the table, surrounded by party  supplies trying to decide which of Michael's  classmates to invite. Where was he? Water  was running in the laundry room. Didn't  he have his animals settled yet? She decided  to find out.  Michael was watching the water flow full  force from the faucet into his bucket, then  over the top, into the laundry room sink.  Waving his arms in mid-air, he babbled  incoherently at the stream of gushing water.   Michael I'm waiting.   She repeated his name three more times  before he finally heard.   Oh hi Mom,  he said turning to face  her.  What do you want?   Lome on.   Why?    Your party.    Do I have to ?    Michael  Now   She turned off the  faucet.  You can finish cleaning your  bucket later.   Michael slumped ahead of her into the  dining room. Then he slumped into his  chair.   Now we really can't invite too many  children.  I bought enough party supplies  for ten. That might be a bit too many.  What do you think, honey?   Michael didn't respond; Evelyn looked  up at him. He was holding himself stiff  and rigid. His spine was pressed flat  against the back of the chair. He stared  beyond her out of the window. His unblinking eyes saw nothing. Slowly, methodically,  he began to rock. Back and forth, back  and forth, he rocked his rigid body against  the chair.  Michael hadn't rocked with such force  since the night, after Timothy's birthday  party last month.  Driving home from the grocery store  that evening, Evelyn had been part way  up the hill which led to the house, when  she had spotted a group of jeering children  standing around Michael and Michael was  flat on his face in the dirt, surrounded  by his classmates. Before Evelyn  could call out to him, Michael was on his  feet running, as best he could, up the  hill towards home.  His shoes were on the wrong feet. Seemed  as if no one could teach him right  from left. When he stumbled, the children  jeered anew. Evelyn honked her car horn  signalling to Michael to climb in. He  saw her but he kept on running.  That night, long after his sister and  his father had fallen asleep, Michael rocked  and banged his head. With each new thud,  that came from his room Evelyn had cringed.

Johnson  Ralph Ogden  Rebecca Pitts  Mary Kelly-Rader  Judith Rae  Nancy Hartman Scott  C. Vlk   C. Simpson  Laurel Smith  Anita Speer Smith  Marie Strunk  Anne Wilcox   Michael,  she repeated helplessly,   what's wrong?   He didn't answer. At a loss as to how  to reach him in his self-imposed trance,  Evelyn turned away.  Guess I'll do some  wash.   After placing the clothes into the washer  she carried Michael's two fish bowls into  his bedroom and set them by the window.  Sunlight painted rainbows in the water.  If Michael were there, he'd tell her about  the prism separating the light into its  component colors. Strange how bright he  seemed at times, yet how poortly he did  at school. Evelyn went back to the dining  room.   Okay Michael. Let's get back to this  party,  she said in a voice louder than  she had intended.  Michael stood by the window. At the  sound of her voice, he turned around.  Scuffing his-feet against the carpet, he  looked down, then peered up at her. Since  she couldn't guite read the expression  on his face, she waited. Michael turned  away again, looking back out of the window.   Lindy can sure jump rope good,  he  said.  She's better than me.  I wish I  could jump rope like she does. I wish.  He mumbled something under his breath.  Evelyn walked over, turned him around.  She peered down into his soft brown eyes.   Jennifer's coming Saturday and we're  going to play in the creek,  he said.   I don't want a party.    What?    I invited her. We're going to play  in the creek.    So that's what was upsetting you.  Why didn't you just come right out and  say so?    You'd get mad,  he mumbled.   And if  I had the party, I'd get all excited and  make too much noise and run around the  house like last year and you'd get mad  too.    You don't want any party at all? Not  even a little one? How about you and Jennifer and Lindy?   Michael shook his head.  I don't like  parties. I like playing in the creek.  Jennifer likes playing in the creek too.    But after I bought all this stuff?   Evelyn asked, indicating with a sweep  of her hand the table full of balloons,  streamers, and party hats.  Are you sure?   Michael nodded.   Okay. I'll just send out one invitation,  to Jennifer.    You don't have to. I already invited  her.    You went ahead and....    Sure.  I know how I get at parties.  Then I thought of Jennifer and me both  liking creeks. When we get tired, we  can come home and have a piece of birthday  cake. Okay?    Okay.    Great. It'll be a better birthday  this way, don't you think?   He sped off to finish cleaning his bucket  chattering incoherently to himself. His  shoes were on the wrong feet again. Evelyn  smiled. Imagine, Michael going ahead and  inviting Jennifer. Wh/ hadn't she thought  to do that? Pretty smart kid, understanding  himself so well. A hell of a lot smarter  than his mother, she decided as she cleared  the party supplies away.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  11  Woman's  Place  Continued from page 4   EditOridl of....   Continued from page 1  to call me controversial. You never hear of  Vincent Cauby of the NEW YORK TIMES or Richard  Stengel of TIME or Jack Kroll of NEWSWEEK  described as controversial. They are simply  critics. But a woman doing it is automatically controversial meaning that what she  says is suspect. And you get very tired of  all that. I mean you want to get to a point  where people look at what you're saying,  and stop trying to psychoanalyze wh    you are  saying it.  Kael went on to say that this  type of discrimination will probably never  dissipate during her lifetime.  Perhaps if more critics were willing to  speak out and give honest opinions as  Kael does, we would see less discrimination  in the movie media toward women.  Pauline Kael is honest, straightforward,  and a woman and thus gives the values viewpoints that only women can fully appreciate.  Local lecturers were Frances Rhome,( Contributions of Women in American History );D'Ann Campbell, ( Heroines at the Home Front: Women During  World War II ); Allegra Stewart,( Women in Fic-  tion:the 19th Century );Rebecca Pitts,( A  Loaded Gun: American Women Poets from Dickinson  to the Present ); and Diane Brashear,( Women  and Stress. ) Micki Perdew covered the Bra-  shear lecture.  WOMEN   STRESS  by MICKI PERDEW  Indpls,In   Work up a sweat,  was the message Dr.  Diane Brashear gave to the audience in her  lecture on  Women and Stress  on May 5.  Although Brashear was scheduled to begin at  7:30 p.m., there was a slight delay as over  one hundred women crowded into the Cropsey  auditorium.  At times, during the lecture, Dr.  Brashear's cool manner was a bit daunting,  but, it was evident she had obviously researched her subject. In an engaging speaking style, Brashear began with a brief statement of the types of stress which affect  everyone. Brashear quickly captured interest  by focusing on the differences between the  reactions of men and women. A major stress  induced seems to be the  invisibility  of  women in a socio-professional setting.  Brashear reported her own reactions when  and her physician - husband are in such  situations and she is recognized only as a  doctor's wife. Brashear said she felt like  she didn't matter. No one inquired about her  profession.  Another downer, says Brashear, is the unrealistic view that a woman must be all  things to everyone. Brashear says, Guilt is  the difference between what we think we're expected to bevand what we really are.  She  suggests:  ...trading independence (I can do  it all by myself) for undependence (I can do my  share in any relationship.)   To cope with stress build-up Brashear advises exercising to sweatpoint at least five  times a week. Running up a flight of stairs  or a physical fitness program can reduce  stress because of bio-chemical reaction  between physical and emotional stress.     *  *  Three concerts featured music by Clara Schumann, Elizabeth Gould, Mrs. H.H.A.

Through the jagged gaping hole, I heard  his crazed voice repeating: 'Give me your  purse   I wanted to blow the horn, but knew  if I did he might have a terrible way to deal  with me for all he now had to do was reach  through the window. His short Afro framed his  shadowed face and the porch light shining from  behind gave a grotesque halo effect. Slender  shoulders, 20-30, dark tee shirt...maroon...?  light colored windbreaker. Will they catch  him if I hurry? In slow motion, I grab my   4.98 cloth bag, move it over my belly, and  throw it out the window onto the ground. It  happened so quickly. Seconds and it was over.  I felt as if it were midnight.  Must start the car. Can't see. Where  is he? Want to run over him. Have to get  help before I pass out. Drive a few blocks  to a Chinese restaurant. Calmly I park the  car. When I open the car door I hear glass  hit the pavement. I look down, then notice  my green shirt and beige vest are covered with  blood. Blood is pooling in my new  15 maternity  bra. I'm angry. I know I look hideous;I  envision a beaten Quasimodo.  I hate to enter  a restaurant where human beings are dining.  From the vestibule, I order the young man  on the phone to help me.  Get the police.  Get me an ambulance. Get me some ice and  clean napkins.  His horrified look and his  hesitation make me repeat the commands. Then,  he shouts his orders and soft voices come to  help me.  Come in. Sit. Sit. It is ok.   I try to hide the blood.  (Weeks later I  return to thank them. They look at me queerly,  wondering what type of person I am.)  Police. Questions in the parking lot.  I'm standing again. Must sit. In the ambulance   No, I don't want to talk to a reporter    The anguish in my daughter's eyes confirms my  choice of anonymity. (Later, she strokes  the back of my head when we leave the hospital..   You're still pretty,  she says through soft  sobs.)   An inch higher, lady, and you'd been  in troubie.  Dead or blind, maybe.  Vou're  real lucky  How'd you manage to drive? You're  what?   Pregnant  Let's go   A fast trip  to the hospital. Siren isn't as loud from  inside.

        <pagetext>1 2  Id OMAN KIN I  Letters From Our Readers  Best wishes for a speedy and complete  recovery. Our thoughts and strength are  sent to you.  Boo, Margie, Ruth  PLEIADES RECORDS  Berkeley, CA.  The latest issue of TIOTIS, which  contained several of ray poems, listed your  magazine in its Intercom section as using  poetry.  Would you please send me a copy of  your guidelines? Enclosed is SASE. Thank  you.  Sisterly regards,  Elsen Lubetsky  Highland Mills, NY.  As an unemployed single woman, the  individual subscription is all that I can  afford at this time. However, after I find  new employment and get caught up on everything I will remember WOMANKIND in a more  substantial way.  In the meantime I wish  you all the best and continued success.  Sincerely,  Karen S. Dudley  Indianapolis, IN.  A friend of mine from Bloomington, Sidney Reger, brought a copy of WOMANKIND to  Pittsburgh when she came to visit. Thought  I'd spread the word here in Pittsburgh.  I'd like two subscriptions, one for my  self and one for Wildsisters, Inc. Wild-  sisters has purchased a building here in  Pittsburgh and is planning to open a coffeehouse, bar, restaurant and women's cultural  center. We're really excited about Wild-  sisters here in Pittsburgh.  Anyway, please accept my check in sup-  , port of the newspaper.  Thanks   Wendy Bell  Pittsburgh, PA.  I enjoyed reading Mary Mahon's objective article on the (Karen) DeCrow/Schafly  debate (Issue 22). Thanks, Mary, for covering the event so well for those of us who  could not attend.  Judith Rae  Indianapolis, IN.  Subscribe  PLEASE NOTE NEW ADDRESS     P.O.

I have recently moved to Texas. Previous to this, I attended Purdue University,  Calumet Campus. My English teacher often  spoke of your newspaper. I had the opportunity of reading one issue and was very im -  pressed.  Enclosed you will find a check for a  subscription.  I am looking forward to my first issue.  In the near future, I intend to submit  articles for possible publication.  Thank you.  Sincerely yours,  Judi Young  Houston, TX.  I appreciate the sample issue of Womankind,  I find the magazine delightful. PLease  find enclosed a check for a subscription.  I have enclosed one of my favorite poems.  I hope you will consider it for publication.  Sincerely,  Doris S. Elliot  Orlando, FL.  I'm not sure about the status of my subscription. Please renew or extend it for a  year and put the change in WOMANKIND's  general operating fund.  Bless you,  Austin F. Johnson  Naples, FL.  P.S.  If my wife were still living, how  she'd love WOMANKIND and its ideals   Enclosed is a poem for your consideration,  I hope you will be able to use it.  It was  written as a reflection of what I had seen  working in a shelter for abused women.  Also enclosed is payment for a subscription  to Womankind.  I hope your publication enjoys  a long life   Sincerely,  Lynda Carson  Browns Mills, N.J.  Please send a copy of WOMANKIND's recent developments and its past history.  Also could you send me the article,  Are We  Our Own Worst Enemies,  by Rebecca Pitts.  Lori Leach  Indianapolis, IN.  I would like very much to help with your  news/magazine. My main motivation is that I  would gain a lot of valuable knowledge so  that possibly one day I could start my own  little magazine. It would in no way be competing with your publication.  When you are going to need help with  something, please let me know in advance.  I am very excited about the possibility of  getting to see the  creation  of a news/  magazine. I realize that much of it is dull  work (stuffing for mailing and so on) but believe me, I want to help.  To tell you just a little about myself:  I am, I guess, a middle-of-the-road feminist.  I feel that it is too easy to become alienated  and isolated if one is too radical in any  endeavor. Also, I tend to prefer to be  for   something (for improving the opportunities for  young women to get scholarships, would be an  example) rather than against something.  However, though I tend not to want to rock  the boat, I would not be opposed to anchoring it and working to get a new motor  sent over.  Enclosed please find my donation to help  WOMANKIND stay afloat.  Rose Irving  Indianapolis, IN.  Perhaps you remember talking with me  at the University of Kentucky Women Writers'  Conference, after the Alice Walker workshop.  Upon returning home, I looked over the  sample issue of WOMANKIND (finding it all  very interesting and enjoyable), then looked  through my own completed writings to see  whether I had anything that you might find  suitable to publish.  I am enclosing a  parable  that I think  would be of interest to your readers.  I would be pleased if readers wished to  reproduce this story and distribute it  for discussion in their women's groups,  etc., and I freely grant permission to  anyone to do so provided my authorship  is noted and it is not used for monetary  profit.  I am also enclosing money for a contribution and a subscription. Keep up the  fine work   In sisterhood,  Peggy Brayfield  Charleston, IL.  I am simply appalled to hear what has  happened to you and to WOMANKIND.  I missed  out on knowing the story because of the snafu which interfered with my getting copies of  Issues 22 and 23.  You say you are getting over the experience, but I hasten to send my sympathy to  carry you along on the rest of the road to  recovery. You can count on your family of  course, and I feel sure there is an unknown  number of women who know you only through  WOMANKIND who will stand by in whatever ways  they can. That concerns me. What can I  a subscriber and contributer do to help  resolve the dilemma? (* See below.) No doubt  your lawyer knows what would be helpful from  us out in the open country. Is there any kind of  evidence we could furnish in connection with  the trial?  I was not born yesterday and I have  been caught up with situations involving  others which were perpetrated by people of  ill-will, but I never had anything like  this brought home to me,   yes, I feel like it  is a shared experience. What on earth  can we do to overcome the fear and hatred felt  by some people? It is not a question of difference of opinion - it is a question of ill-  will.  I have been a member of ACLU for more  than thirty-five years, and wonder what help  they might give in your case. No doubt you  are in touch with the ACLU in Indiana.  Rebecca Pitts expressed in her Guest Editorial in Issue 23, the way I feel, and I  am sure the way many of the WOMANKIND's  subscribers feel. I am so riled up inside  that maybe I will be able to write something  that will do my feelings justice.  Meanwhile, I hope for the best and speedy  result of the Court Case. Above that,  I am hoping you will continue to improve  until you are back to your former self.  Much appreciation and love,  Cordelle K. Ballard  West Haven, CT.  * What can a reader do? . Well, encourage  (demand?) that your local library, college,  women's center, YWCA, women's prison, etc.  subscribe  And don't forget your attorney,  physician, insurance agent, etc. and, of  course, your friends. Is there a bookstore in your area that would carry WOMANKIND?  Do you know a business that could benefit  by advertising in WOMANKIND? Suggest they do   And   C T  WOMANKIND'S phone     (317)  926-6110  SUBSCRIBE   for a FRIEND  The number on your address label indicates  the issue of your subscription expiration. If  you have a  23,22,21,etc. this is the last  WOMANKIND you will receive UNLESS you send your  subscription payment. (If you recently sent a  check or money order,of course this does  not apply to you.)

        <pagetext>Page 2  WOMANKIND  Dear Readers  WOMANKIND believes that this  paper is very special. We, the  staff, take few bows for this  because YOU, our writers, are our  artists.  We know our ads have benefited  our advertisers and our consumers.  It is strange then that our hardest job is procuring advertisers.  Many are apprehensive or afraid of  being associated with a paper named  WOMANKIND. Many are angry, disgusted or dismayed at our suggestion they do so.  we have little  time to solicit possible advertisers. Too, it is truly deflating to be refused several  times (sometimes almost violently)  in one day.  Because dear readers you have  been so supportive and because you  continue to be the reason we strive  to publish WOMANKIND, we are asking  you to truly become a part of us.  If you are in business    advertize with us. If you know someone  who might be interested in advertising with us, let us know who  and where they are.  Drop us a line with the prospective advertiser's name and the  person we should contact and believe me we shall. Your leads,  your support, your good will will  tise with us.  If you know someone  who might be interested in advertising with us, let us know who  and where they are.   For what is done or learned by one class  women becomes, by nature of their common  omanhood, the property of all women.   Elizabeth Blackwell, 1821-1910  WOMANKIND wants to publish your  essays, articles, poems, stories,  cartoons, graphics, one-liners, book  reviews, etc. Our only requirement  for our writers is that they be female. If you so request, we will  publish your material anonymously  or under a pseudonym; however, we  cannot publish anything unless you  include your name and address so we  can contact you if necessary.  Separate or accompanying photographs  (which we welcome) should include all  pertinent information. Photos cannot  be returned. All material should be  mailed to WOMANKIND Box 16306, Indianapolis, Indiana 1*6216. Manuscripts  should be accompanied by a self-  addressed, stamped return mailer,  if the contributor wishes to have  the manuscript returned. Any  material accepted is subject to  such revision as is necessary in  our sole discretion to meet the requirements of this publication. The  Editors welcome any personal data  about the authors and would like  that included, but it is not  necessary. Please include name,  address, and phone number. The  act of mailing a manuscript  and/or material shall constitute  an express warranty by the contributor that the material is  original and in no way an infringement upon the rights of others.

PROFILES   PLACES  A stronger emphasis on helping  the re-entry woman  is the  goal of Pam Peterson newly appointed Assistant Director for the Continuing Education Center for Women  at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis.   We plan to expand both counseling and courses to help women  who want to re-enter the job  market or return to college.    In addition we want to add  to the list of 'practical,'  job oriented courses we offer,  to provide marketable skills  training for the woman who has  been away from business for  several years,  said the new  Assistant Director.  Pam holds B.A. and M.S. degrees  and is currently working on a  doctorate in Adult Education at  Indiana University, specializing  in women's programming. In Koko-  mo, she was YWCA Adult Program's  Director, and has been Conference  Coordinator for the I.U.P.U.I  Continuing Studies Division for  the past year.  Pam was born in South Bend and  has lived, in several Hoosier cities.  At the present she shares her home  in Broadripple with Margaret and  Dorothy, the former an eight year  old Calico cat; the latter belonging to an alley variety.  Pam says  her cats help her study by sitting  in the middle of her books   demanding her attention.  Attending class two nights a  week, working 9 to 5 every day  plus one evening per week leaves  Pam with little time for anything  else. However, she does like to  sew and also does her own wallpapering and carpeting. Pam is  also listed in the I.U.P.U.I  Speakers Service for 1977-78.  Her topic:  Re-Entry Women: What's  Out There?

The Center itself is a warm and  friendly place and it is located  at 1301 E. 38th Street,(Indianapolis, Indiana U6205) across from  the State Fairgrounds.  More than 1*00 women have been  counseled at the Center in the  past two years of its existence*  The Center is for women who  are economically or emotionally  in difficulty. This can be because of a divorce, children leaving home, or employment problems.  The Center also serves women who  want to change careers or upgrade  their incomes. In the past the  age span of those who attended the  center has been 16 to 67. However,  one 75 gt;-year-old woman via this  center applied for financial aid  to return to school   and received  it.  Another feature of the Center is  an aptitude Testing Service which is  available. This test can be administered anytime between 9-5 daily. It  is best to call to make an appointment, but it is not absolutely  necessary. The test takes approximately an hour and there is no  pressure involved. There is a   5.50 fee for the test. The fee  includes a one-to-one counseling  session (if desired) to discuss the  results of the test.     'fy-M lt;      The Center provides counseling,  information, and a variety of  classes.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 3  New Harmony, Equality For  Women, And Frances Wright  AS IT has been from its beginning,  New Harmony, Indiana, is today a  quiet little village on the lower  Wabash River with a population (less  than 1 00 persons) that has increased  very little since 1825. Here one  finds wide streets shaded by majestic  trees   many hundreds of them the   golden-rain  trees, or  gate  trees,  so well known over southern Indiana.  Here too one sees well-built and often  beautiful old homes and now and then  massive brick and stone structures  erected by the original Rappites.  You will not see, however, the  hideous neon-lit garages, hot-dog  stands, and other monstrosities  that deface the majority of town  and cities in the United States.  For New Harmony belongs to the  world-aristocracy of villages that  have made world history; and the  state of Indiana and the local  community are equally proud of that  history and mean to preserve the  physical beauty of the place. To  that end, in fact, the Indiana State  Legislature created in 1938 the New  Harmony Memorial Commission for the  purpose of acquiring and restoring  the many historic landmarks in the  town.  New Harmony was the locus of two  Utopian experimental colonies, both  of which failed. But out of failure  and the disintegration of the ideal of  social perfection came several vital  ideas in more limited areas   ideas  that had state-wide, national, and  international significance. From  the viewpoint of Womankind, of  course, the most significant seed-  idea to germinate here was that of  full equality for women. With respect to this idea it is difficult  to say who was more important   or  which one influenced the other  more   Fanny Wright or Robert  Dale Owen, the most famous son of  Robert Owen, founder of the second  colony. What can be said for certain  is that these two great, and greathearted people met in New Harmony  .in 1826, were closely associated  for several years, and left their  stamp forever on the women's movement.  YOU WILL hear practically  nothing, however, about Frances  Wright (1795-1852) if you visit  New Harmony and take one of the  local tours. When you visit the  old Fauntleroy Home you will be  told that Constance Owen Fauntleroy,  Robert Owen's granddaughter, lived  here and founded the Minerva Club,  first women's club in the United  States to be organized with constitution and by-laws. And if  you're listening closely you  may catch an allusion to an  earlier, less formal club, founded  by Fanny Wright between 1825 and  I828, which was probably the very  first women's literary club in  the United States. But you will  hear nothing about Fanny Wright  herself   who she was, why she  came to New Harmony, and what she  stood for. Similarly, you will  hear strangely little, if anything, about the actual achievements of Robert Dale Owen (1801-1877).  On the other hand, doubtless  because the original  Harmonists   left the most tangible traces of  their lives here, you will hear  (and see) a good deal pertaining to  the Rappites. Under the leadership  (dictatorship, actually) of George  Rapp, this sturdy but ascetic group  of Separatist German Lutherans  bought 30,000 acres of government land in Posey County, Indiana;  and in 1815 the entire colony of  celibate workers moved in from  Pennsylvania, to found the village  of  Harmonie.  Here they toiled  for ten years to build a perfect  community: they cleared the  forests, cultivated the soil,  and erected the first buildings  and dwellings. The former are  museums today, and many of the  latter are still used as homes.  In 182U, however, for reasons  not altogether clear, Father Rapp  sent an Englishman named Richard  Flower to England to offer the  Harmonie estate for sale. Since at  that time Robert Owen (1771-1858)  was the most famous philanthropist  and social reformer in all Europe,  Flower naturally went to him first.  The deal was closed early in 1825     the total acreage, handsome buildings, and valuable equipment going  for less than  150,000.  If the presumable failure of  Rappite colony seems mysterious,  it was quite otherwise with the  Frances Wright, (first Indiana feminist):  Wright, a member of the New Harmony  movement, organized the first known woman's   club in America. Her educational concepts in  the Owens' community are also well-known.  one Owen set up in its place and  called New Harmony. Here from the  start the difficulty was obvious:  not enough authority and discipline;  too much reliance on the  better  nature  of people. Owen's basic  philosophy, expressed in A New View  of Society (1813), was thax  circum-  stances form character ; and he  proposed   somewhat in the spirit of  Pestalozzi and modern progressive  education   not to coerce, but to  appeal, and to offer his colonists a  perfect physical environment and  equal opportunity for all, regardless  of sex, creed, color, or economic  status. But by Christmas of 1825 a  heterogeneous crew of nearly 1,000  persons (many of them shiftless,  greedy, or opportunistic) had on  Owen's published invitation  settled into the comfortable  Rappite houses. Meanwhile Owen  himself, probably aware that the  venture had got off to a bad start,  had returned to England to enlist  the help of trained specialists.  They came   many of them (including  Robert Dale Owen, then barely 2k) on  the famous  Boatload of Knowledge,  a  keelboat which came from Pittsburgh  down the Ohio and up the Wabash and  landed on January 26, 1826. A few  notables, including Fanny Wright, had  arrived somewhat earlier. For a time  all went well  enough: there were  lectures, concerts, a real effort  to divide the work fairly, and     above all   genuinely progressive  schools, which were based on  Pestalozzian ideas and included  nursery classes, manual training,  and equal educational opportunities  for girls. (The last-named innovation  was at least a half century ahead of  its time for the country as a whole;  and indeed, in view of recent trends  toward intensified sex-role stereotyping in schools, it would still be a-  head of the times today.)  In spite of these excellent features,  however, the New Harmony experiment  foundered on practical economic problems, and on the laziness and bickering of the colonists. Early in 1827  Owen's sons admitted, in the New  Harmony Gazette, that the venture had  failed; and after their father left in  May, 1827 (optimistic to the last),  the whole thing fell to pieces.  Owen's immense fortune was lost in  the squabbles that followed, although his son William Owen (who  had recently arrived), aided by  Robert Dale Owen, managed to  salvage enough to insure to  their father a life income of some   1,500 a year.  New Harmony's international influence rested chiefly on Robert  Owen's career and philosophy, although the failure of the experiment had great negative value,  as an anti-Utopian object lesson,  when Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels  were formulating their theory of   scientific  socialism.  New Harmony's impact on Indiana and  the United States as a whole was  channeled through several individuals.  cont'd, to Page h

        <pagetext>Page k  WOMANKIND  NEW HARMONY,etc. Cont'd from  Page 3  Magnetized by Owen's great though  impossible dream, dozens of brilliant educators, scientists, and  intellectuals came either on the   Boatload  or later, and paid protracted visits (like John James  Audubon) or made their homes here.  Outstanding among the visitors  were the eminent Dutch geologist  Gerard Troost and Sir Charles  lyell, famed Scottish geologist.  Some of these visitors and residents expressed themselves in  additions to scientific knowledge (from 1839 to 18 6, when  it was removed to the new Smithsonian  Institution in Washington, the United  States Geological Survey had its  headquarters in New Harmony, and David  Dale Owen and his brother Richard held  important posts). But the New  Harmonists also made contributions to  general education, by endowing 160  workingmen's libraries throughout  Indiana and Illinois   libraries which  aided greatly in establishing the  township and traveling libraries  which eventually absorbed them. And  in the case of Fanny Wright and  Robert Dale Owen, they disseminated  ideas of social progress and effected  great practical reforms, especially  for women.  UNDOUBTEDLY the most glamorous  and widely celebrated personality  to sojourn in New Harmony for a while  was Frances Wright or  Fanny,  as the  public called her. She was already  famous as a philanthropist and  brilliant writer when she arrived  late in 182 ,  at the age of thirty.  From then on for several years her  life was closely related to that of  Robert Dale Owen, whom she must have  met as soon as the  Boatload of  Knowledge  landed.  Fanny was born in Dundee, Scotland,  September 6, 1795. Orphaned at the age  of two, she was educated in England by  aristocratic relatives, and with a  spendidly large inheritance to go on,  she was able to study and travel. As  a youngster she had read the great  documents and stories of the  American Revolution; and in 1818,  at twenty-three, she visited the  United States for the first time,  staying until 1820, In 1819 her  play, Altorf, which dealt with  the Swiss fight for freedom, was  produced in New York City.  Back home, she published in  1821 her Views of Society and.  Manners in America   a book so  enthusiastically written in contrast to the disparaging accounts  of most European tourists that it  attracted instant attention,  especially from the Trollopes,  (Frances and her son Anthony),  the philosopher Jeremy Bentham  (an English kinsman of hers),  and the Marquis de Lafayette.  She formed a close friendship  with Lafayette, then an old man,  and in 182u returned to the United  States as his traveling companion.  He introduced her to some of the  surviving Revolutionary heroes,  notably Jefferson and Madison;  and fired by republican ideals  she stayed on when Lafayette  went home.  She was determined, in fact, to  try out an idea she had for the  emancipation of black slaves. Her  Plan for the Gradual Abolition of  Slavery (1825) had the approval of  Jefferson and Madison; and she purchased a number of slaves and 2,000  acres of mosquito-haunted woodland,  which she called Nashoba, in  Tennessee. Her idea was that resident  slaves would work and earn their  freedom while being educated. At  about this time, however, she heard  of Owen's colony at New Harmony, went  there to visit, met the Owen's and was  enchanted by their ideas of social  cooperation   not to mention the budding  feminism inherent in equal education  for girls. She therefore resolved to  make Nashoba a similar community;  but during one of her absences a  radical recruit of hers published  (apparently using Wright's name)  a work called Explanatory Notes,  which killed Nashoba by claiming  that the community was based on free  love and racial interbreeding. This  was not true, though in principle  Wright would hardly have opposed such  ideas. And so collapsed one of  history's few attempts to solve  the slavery problem without  violence. (She eventually settled  her own slaves in Haiti.)  Meanwhile she was deeply  involved at New Harmony, where  during 1826 and 1827, until  the colony broke up, she was  with Robert Dale Owen the co-  editor of the New Harmony  Gazette. During the same years  she began her daring and inflammatory lecture career-  daring because of the Nashoba  scandal, inflammatory because of  her attacks on religion.  It is not clear whether at this  time she was as enchanted with young  Owen's person as she was with his  ideas; but no impressionable young  man could have failed to be enchanted  with Fanny: her beauty, idealism, and  brilliance must have been very compel  ing. In short, although she was six  years older than he, it is hard not to  believe that he was in love with her.  And since she went to New York with  him and lived with him during 18 28,  QG  3BC  SB  FREE  Catalog  From  3tn  FREE UNIVERSITY j  listing  *over 150 courses  * costing  5 to  20  * for 4 to 8 weeks  * satisfaction guaranteed  or a full credit refund  359-6430 or 357-7854  office:   526 E. 52nd  Indpls., IN 46205  Bi it in  J  an independent womens newsjournal  women in struggle  politics, health, work, prison  news coverage and political analysis  on the issues that affect womens lives  contributing sub  12 or more  one year sub  6    sample copy 60c  foreign  13    Canada  7  business and institutions  20  oob, 1724 20th st. nw,  wash, dc 20009  1829, and 1830, it is hard not to  believe that she also was in love,  although there is nothing in their  letters and Owen's journal to prove  any of this. In any case these two  young Scottish-Americans (Owen was  born in Glasgow), with so much in  common, had inevitably formed a  deep friendship. It was during  this New York period that they  edited together the Free Enquirer   a paper which supported the  Workingmen's Party and many reform  issues, and promoted feminist ideas,  including birth control. (Owen was  by now the author of a pioneering  book, called Moral Physiology, on  this subject.)  By I83O Fanny Wright was famous  as the nation's first woman lecturer.  She was tall and strikingly lovely,  with a voice, it is said, of great  power and sweetness; and she had the  utter fearlessness that goes with  strong convictions, keen thought, and  a sense of great inner security. Not  only the scandal about Nashoba,  however, but her open advocacy of  birth control, the rights of women  and workingmen, and the emancipation  of the slaves   all this made each of  her public appearances a perilous  event. Mobs threatened her, fires  were lit in her lecture halls, and  she was fanatically abused by the  press, especially for her attacks  on organized religion as a reactionary force; but people came to hear  her, and in the New York election of  1829 the  Fanny Wrighters  polled  6,000 votes.  Fanny Wright is said to have become so depressed by her sister's  death in 1831 that she married  William d'Arusmont, a well-known  educator whom she had met at New  Harmony. But since Owen married  in 1832 and returned to New  Harmony, one wonders which one  of them depressed the other  with news of impending marriage.  In any case Wright's return to  the lecture platform in 1835, on  behalf of Andrew Jackson, led to the  break-up of her marriage.  Along with Margaret Fuller and  the Grimke sisters, Frances Wright was  one of those solitary women who prefigured the real women's movement  later in the century. nBy her  words,  says Miriam Schneir (Feminism;  the Essential Historical Writings,  p.19),  she awakened in many the dis-  content that comes before action; by  cont'd to Page 10

Shortly after Betty Freidan wrote  The Feminine Mystique the literary  world suddenly discovered the trapped  housewife. Authors wrote prolifically, and sometimes sensitively, on the  plight of young, confused, frustrated wives and mothers. The womenTrwere  invariably married to boorish men and  had innumerable, faceless children.  The Cracker Factory by Joyce  Rebeta-Burditt is such a novel.  Cassie Barrett, a 28-year-old  mother of three, housewife,  alcoholic, mental patient, is  the narrator and central character of the book. But Ms. Rebeta-  Burditt can't seem to decide if  Cassie and her problems should be  taken seriously and explored fully.  Cassie spends most of the book  in the mental ward of her local  hospital trying to decide whether  to leave her husband, give up her  lover, beat her drinking problem,  get her own job or resume the role  of wife and mother. Pretty weighty  stuff.  And at times sensitively  handled.  The author shows brief moments of  real  insight into the problems of  alcohol and depression. Early in  the book Cassie dissolves into  tears and confusion while trying to  choose which breakfast cereal to  purchase at the supermarket.  The sections in which Cassie  battles her guilt about drinking and  the effect it has on her children are  also well done. She is alternately  contrite, confused, resolute and  oblivious to the situation. But the  sections dealing with Cassie's  battle with alcohol with the help  of Alcoholics Anonymous read like  journalism, not fiction. Her characters remain one dimensional.  The author never really lets Cassie  explain the roots of her problems.  She never lets her other characters  break out of tight molds. Cassie's  husband is self centered. Her  mother is cold and demanding. Her  younger sister is intelligent,  beautiful and a source of constant  envy for Cassie. Her psychiatrist  is long suffering and wise. The  nurses on the mental ward are gruff,  but have hearts of gold. Her fellow  mental patients act more like the  cast of a situation comedy on television than emotionally disturbed  persons.  Some of the dialogue is funny,  or tragic, depending on a reader's  viewpoint. Unfortunately Ms.  Rebeta-Burditt never decides if her  book is a serious look at how  society molds women into roles and one  one woman's struggle with that  molding, or if she wants to transplant the character Lucille Ball  played in the television series   I Love Lucy  to the suburbs of  Cleveland.

        <pagetext>Page 6  WOMANKIND    lr  oii  Boar*  by PAT HEIDENREICH  I'VE GOT TO GET  ORGANIZE  D  During the holiday season I  could very easily develop a  colossal inferority complex.  I know there are many women  today that hold down full-time  jobs, keep their husbands contented,  raise well-adjusted, beautifully  mannered children, participate in  various community activities...and  still manage to gracefully work in  their Christmas cards, shopping,  baking, wrapping and parties.  These women are organized. Their  various duties are arranged on a  list in order of importance.  Just  the thought of these gals, always  cool and collected, calmly and with  a flourish, checking off one item  after another from their lists  upon completion...sends me into a  fit of jealousy mixed with hatred  ...mainly because at this time of  year I just seem to run around in  circles wearing a frenzied look of  hysteria.  The organized working  woman's list probably reads:  TUESDAY, DEC. 19th  8:30 a.m.  Meeting...present  outline to Board  of Directors  10:30 a.m.  Lecture to Van Ralis  Historical Society  12:00 noon Women's Club  luncheon  3 to 5 p.m. Finish Christmas  shopping  6:00 p.m. Dinner with family  (prepare Been Sto-  ganoff and Cherries  Jubilee)  9:00 p.m. Neighbors coming for  cocktails  Before retiring...exercise program and beauty  treatment  When I try a list, I always get  bogged down with incidentals that  the organized gal doesn't have to   rorry about...  TUESDAY, DEC. 19th  Get up.  (This is always my  first major obstacle)  Find kid's sox...find husband's  sox...find my sox.  Do quick load of clothes for  everyone to wear.  Get husband to unplug john.  Find mittens, hats, homework  and boots.  Scrape car...and get it started.  Be in good mood at office...  even if it is the full  moon.  LUNCH...stay on a diet.  2:30 p.m.  Call teacher for  weekly behavior report.  4:00 p.m.  Call husband, ask to  pick up hamburgers on  way home.  DINNER...stay on diet.  Investigate what's been smelling in refrig.  Buy tree and cards...make out  gift list.  Pay paperboy.  Get kids to shovel out their  rooms...also, threaten  kids with eternal  grounding if fighting  doesn't end.  Hope company doesn't come.  Either shave legs or braid hair.  Plan tomorrow's list.  ( See, I told you I have a problem:)  If I was a person who was able  to think ahead a few days.. .we  wouldn't have arrived an hour late  to the company Christmas party.  My  husband wouldn't have had to wear a  shirt with a missing button on the  cuff causing it to flap slightly  from his suit sleeve...(this  could've been avoided, of course,  had we been able to find either a  button or cuff-links.)...and I  wouldn't have sat down at the table  with ten of my husband's coworkers and then noticed that one  of my short white gloves had  en roidered flowers on it and the  other one had 3 little buttons.  If I was organized, these  things wouldn't have happened and I  wouldn't have gotten flustered when  they did and while standing in the  buffet line I wouldn't have put my  elbow into that gentleman's dinner  plate.  Actually, my dress was  partly to blame for this...it was  killing me, since I've gained 18  pounds since I last wore it and  feeling like a  stuffed sausage tied  in the middle does something to  one's suaveness.

        <pagetext>Page 7  WOMANKIND  Joan Joyce:  Woman  Athlete  Professional softball player Joan  Joyce has been clocked at 116 miles-  per-hour with her amazing fastball.  Her pitching record is outstanding  and unbelieveable.  Joyce's won-lost record for 22  seasons was 533-3U, and that included 128 no-hitters.  This 37 year old member of the  world champion Connecticut Falcons  is from Waterbury, Connecticut.  She started playing ball when she  was a small child.   WL  ROSS.?  Two new complexes providing individual office space with shared  secretarial and office administration services are being opened in  Indianapolis by B.O.S.S., Inc. One  is a ten-office suite overlooking  Monument Circle, and designed for  the exclusive use of lawyers; the  other is a general business and  professional facility at Park  Avalon on the city's northeast  side.  The B.O.S.S. acronym means  'Business Office and Secretarial  Services' and the firm has been  established in three other  Indianapolis locations where  tenants have private offices subleased by B.O.S.S. with access to  full office services at rates determined by actual use. Ms. Peggy  Brewster and Ms. Margaret Huffman  are principals in B.O.S.S., which  presently operates facilities at  7999 Knue Road (Castleton), and  621u Morenci Trail (near College  Park).  The newly-opening facility on  the eighth floor of the Circle  Tower Building will be known as  the Independent Lawyers Association,  and services available will be  geared to the needs of the legal  profession for a downtown office  convenient to the courts. A  conference room will be provided  for attorneys, in addition to a  well-equipped office with trained  legal secretarial help. The  complex occupies 3,2u3 square  feet in Suite 800, Circle Tower.  The Park Avalon facility,  opening soon, will also offer ten  office areas, for other business  and professional tenants. They  will find office service capabilities including information storage  and retrieval, individual telephone  handling, letter shop services,  and optional personalized communication and bookkeeping services.  Both locations provide parking  and transportation access.  Traveling Alone In Europe  In spite of being a woman of  independent spirit, I was frightened at the thought of making my  first flight to Europe alone. Still,  after planning and dreaming about the  vacation for several years, I refused to cancel my scheduled trip  when I learned that the friend who  was to accompany me could not go.  So, feeling quite adventuresome,  I set off in late summer on a  TWA GETAWAY TOUR. The tour which I  chose was quite unstructured,  providing only transportation to  and from the various airports and  a one-half day sight-seeing tour in  each of the three cities I visited   Paris, London, and Amsterdam.  The first thing that happened to  me in Paris was missing the TWA-  Travelers agent at DeGaulle Airport. But happily, fortified with  the latest information on the  world's airports from reading a  recent issue of TIME, I knew that  the average fare into Paris was   12.00; so, off I went, chauffeured  by the French taxi driver and his  dog-protector, a small wire haired  terrier named Miquette.  I did all of the usual tourist  things in Paris, an admission which  does not embarrass me in the slightest. The point is that I enjoyed  myself, alone. I neither pined  away in my hotel room nor attached  myself to any of the other Americans  in my group. I enjoyed myself with  others when I was invited to join  them, but I did not need to become  a part of a trio or quartette to  have a good time. I rode the  BATEAUX MOUCHES on the Seine alone.  I walked from the Louvre to the  Eiffel Tower along the edge of the  Seine alone. I walked to the Arch  of Triumph alone and I rode the  Metro alone. I enjoyed myself no  less in ray solitude.  MARY ALEXANDER IN AMSTERDAM  In Amsterdam, my activities were  much the same as they were in Paris.  I enjoyed walking, traveling on the  city's excellent tram system and  visiting the local museums, often  alone.  In London, I traveled on the  famous British doubled deckered  buses alone; I had high tea in  Harrods, the elegant department  store, alone. I journeyed to  Stratford-upon-Avon alone. And  glad I was that I did not have to  share my thoughts with anyone at  those moments because I am a  confessed Bardologist. I wanted  to revel at walking where HE had  walked. And I did.  To travel to Europe alone was  frightening to me  when I first  considered the possibility. But  I am glad that I found the courage  to take the trip. I had a unique  opportunity for a woman who rapidly  went from being mother's daughter  to husband's wife to daughters'  mother. I had the opportunity to  be Mary Alexander, person.

        <pagetext>Page 8  WOMANKIND  The Liberated Woman's Cookbook  Pat Watson  UNSTUFFED TURKEY    RELATED GOODIES  When I was a kid, we had turkey on Thanksgiving, then turkey  sandwiches, turkey hash and when  turkey soup appeared on the table,  we knew it was time to start  wrapping Christmas presents.  Now we don't have to wait till  Thanksgiving to enjoy this bounty  With a freezer to store serving-  size packages, you won't feel  glutted by a gobbler.  ROAST TURKEY  To save wear and tear on my arithmetic, I always roast turkeys for  30 minutes to the pound. This means  a 10-lb. bird will roast for 5 hours,  so you can cook a 16 lb. turkey for  8 hours without damage.  To roast a turkey all day:  Take the giblets out of their  hiding places and wash the bird  thoroughly. Spread unsalted  shortening on tbe skin and wrap  the whole thing in heavy duty-  aluminum foil. Place in a roaster in a 3 0  degree  oven for 30  minutes to the pound. If guests  are going to see the whole bird,  unwrap it for the last U5 minutes  of cooking time to let it get  nice and brown; otherwise don't  bother.  After dinner, cut the meat  into nice slices and freeze in  meal-size packets. The little  crumbly pieces make a great  turkey salad.  TURKEY SALAD  2 c diced turkey meat  1 c diced celery  1 c broken walnuts  2 or 3 hard boiled eggs, cut up  3g teasp. salt  Mayonnaise  Put it all together and mix with enough  enough mayonnaise to make it stick.  To zip up the flavor even more,  mix about 1 part French dressing  to 3 parts mayonnaise, then add  the salad ingredients. Serve on  lettuce leaves or as sandwich  filling.  QUICK CREAMED TURKEY  1 cup turkey pieces  1 can cream of mushroom soup  (undiluted)    cup milk  1 Tbs. dried onion flakes    c chopped celery  Simmer all ingredients, serve on  toast, patty shells, noodles or  rice. This is pretty with a  dash of paprika on top of each  serving, or use a sprinkle of  parsley or dill.  SOUPER CREAMED TURKEY  2 cups turkey pieces  1 can cream of chicken or cream  of turkey soup  1 can cream of celery soup  1 can water  1 package frozen peas and carrots  1 cup instant rice  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes,  serve over your choice of  chow mein noodles  patty shells  toast cups or just toast  omit the rice in the mixture and  serve it all over a bed of rice  instead.  TOAST CUPS  Trim crusts from slices of bread.  Press the slices into muffin cups  so the points stick up and bake  at 300 degrees for 30 minutes.  TURKEY SOUP  Simmer the turkey bones with a  whole onion in a covered pot of  water. This is another all day  forget-it deal. When you remove  the bones, add salt to taste, half  a handful of rice or noodles and  a dash of celery seed.  womankind  is interested in publishing some  short biographical articles on  the following women:  Albion Fellows Bacon, housing reform leader   poet,b. 1865.

(Federally  Employed Women) Conference held in  Indianapolis on October 22 and 23.  Over 300 women heard the Indianapolis Shortridge High School,  Kentucky State and Howard University  School of Law graduate deliver the  keynote speech, for which she received a standing ovation.  Other speakers were Virginia  Dill McCarty and Barbara Bailey  Howard. Some workshop leaders  were Dr. Priscilla Ransohoff,  Dr. Mary Fuller, Dr. Frances  Dodson Rhome, Doris Thompson,  and Freda Kurtz. Each of these  women have lengthy credentials.  This Regional Training Conference  with delegates from Ohio, Michigan,  Illinois, Minnesota, and Indiana  was smoothly run by and coordinated  by many women and WOMANKIND was  impressed with their businesslike  decorum and their enthusiastic response to the speakers, workshops,  and other members who attended.  One of the general themes of the  conference was  I wondered why  somebody didn't do something...Then  I realized I was somebody.  Those  attending this conference seemed  to believe in that theme.  WOMANKIND hopes that these  conferences could be opened up  to the general female public  because much information should  be shared.  Some topics were:  Sexism vs. Racism  Values Clarification  Upward Mobility Basics  Assertiveness Training  The Women's Movement  How to Manage Credit as  Knowledgeable Consumer  Do You Need an Attorney?

        <pagetext>Page 10  WOMANKIND  I  9  BIRTHDAY  BENEFIT  WomatfS cWbrd       Woman's Touch  cWomanSOng   everywoman's center  INDIANAPOLIS, IND.  WOMANKIND was at the Birthday  Benefit for Woman's Touch and everywoman's center. The premiere performance of WOMAN'S WORD starred  Maureen Sullivan and Nancy Sundell,  who received a standing ovation for  their rendering of women through  vignettes and sketches, using original poetry/drama and pieces of  literature from a variety of sources.  Selections from A Gift from the Sea  and The Feminine Mystique were  included along with the poetry of  Anne Sexton, Nikki Giovanni, Denise  Levertov and Gertrude Stein.  Also represented were Lillian Hell-  man, Colette, and Anais Ninn. A  local talant, Kathy D. Ballard, who  had much to do with the entire production also had four original poems  performed. This part of the program, done entirely from memory and.  with few props, was spell-binding and   just right.  All of the women who  were involved in this effort should  be commended.  The second half of the program,  WOMANSONG, featured the feminist  songwriter, singer and guitarist,  Therese Edell. Therese is from  Cincinnati and is currently appearing at The Winery there.  She has appeared on college  campuses, in bars, and was at the  Michigan Women's Music Festival.  Therese is an accomplished  musician. She plays  string, woodwind, and brass instruments.  Her new album.   I Shouldn't  Have Sent lou to Cincinnati has  just been released. We highly recommend it.  Therese's music and her personality reflect her feelings about herself, her life, and her world. Therese  is a feminist who says,  Women are the  most important beings in the world  for me, and there are a few men  who are right up there too. Women  have a special strength. We are  a fallen race about to rise againJf  WOMANKIND APPRECIATES Y0U1  THIS MONTH  SPECIAL THANKS TO:  ALL the women and men, girls and boys  who have aided us in many ways.

Name  Address  ZIP  Phone  NEW HARMONY,etc. Cont'd  from Page h  her life, she demonstrated woman's  potential for intellectual development and a widened sphere of activity.   I like to think, however, that in  addition it was she who really fired  Robert Dale Owen with that passion  for women's rights, and women's  freedom, which was manifest later  in his career.  It is true that Owen accomplished  much in his long, useful life that  was not directly related to women's  rights. And throughout his career  in practical politics, his father's  influence was very great. After  returning to New Harmony, Owen was  elected to the Indiana state legislature in I836. From 18H2 to 18U6  he was a member of Congress, where  he originated and introduced the  bill providing for the application  of the long-dormant Smithson bequest  to the founding (in 18U5) of the  Smithsonian Institution.  (In 1856,  about a third of the great geological collection at the New Harmony  museum was removed to the Smithsonian. ) Also, in 18UU, Owen  introduced a measure concerning  the Oregon boundary which was the  basis for the settlement of that  problem in 18U6. In 1853 he became a charge  d'affaires at Naples,  and in 1855 United States minister  to Italy.  On his return in 1858   after  advocating for 30 years, in line  with his father's and Fanny Wright's  gradualist ideas, a peaceful and  legal emancipation of the slaves-  Owen became a champion of forcible  emancipation. In 1862 he wrote a  letter to President Lincoln, which  according to Secretary Chase had   more influence on him (Lincoln)  than any other document which  reached him on the subject   I  think I may say than all others  put together.  Owen wrote well,  and published several books; at  least two of these were on  spiritualism (1859 and 1872),  which in his later years he  firmly believed in.  But the people of Indiana,  and especially its women, are  in debt to Owen chiefly for his  activities in 1851 and 1852. At  the State Convention in 1851 he  was largely responsible for the  clauses in the new constitution  providing for free tax-supported  schools. His speeches on this  subject, and on equal rights for  women, are said to have shown a  vision and statesmanship unequaled  by any other delegate. Needless  to say, he was defeated on women's  rights; but in the 1852 legisla  ture he succeeded in improving  the divorce laws and in giving  separate property and income rights  to married women. That was an  epoch-making achievement, for up to  this time in Indiana a woman had to  surrender every claim, upon marriage,  to a separate legal and financial  existence.  It was in this historic year,  for Indiana women, that Fanny Wright  died   on December 13, 1852, in  Cincinnati, Ohio. If she heard the  Indiana news, Robert Dale Owen's  feminist achievements must have  gladdened, and re-kindled, her heart.  Nearly twenty-five years later  Robert Dale Owen died, at Lake  George, New York, on June 2k,  1877.  In 1937 his bones were removed for  final interment to New Harmony,  Indiana, where they belonged.  R. E. Pitts  Associate Professor of  English, Emeritus, I-P-I.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page U  About the  How appropriate for the National  Women's Conference in Huston, Texas,  to be called to order with the gavel  used by Susan B. Anthony at a  National Suffrage Conference in  Washington, D.C. in I896 and loaned  for this occasion by the Smithsonian. An all women drum and  bugle corp then announced the  entry of the giant flaming torch  which had been carried by relays of  women runners all the way from  Seneca Falls, N.Y., site of the  first national women's rights  meeting in 18H8. A color guard  of Girl Scouts advanced and led  the pledge of allegiance to the  American flag.  Assembled were 1,800 voting  delegates and many thousand alternates, observers and press  representatives from all 50  states and 6 territories. An  historic first   the first Congress mandated and funded meeting ever held to address the  concerns of women. The Conference was part of our nation's  observance of International  Women's year which has been  extended for a decade ending ,in 1985.  The members of the National  Commission of IWY, appointed by  President Carter, were introduced  by Bella Abzug, former Representative from New York. She stated  the Commission members had a total of 7h  children and 17 grandchildren and were advocates of  strengthening the family. The former Commission appointed by President Ford was introduced, including  Jill Ruckelshaus, a Hoosier.  The division in the body was  immediately evident. As the  commission members and dignitaries  such as Coretta Scott King and  Margaret Mead were presented, the  20  anti-IWY delegates remained  seated. However, the 31 anti-IWY  members of Indiana's 32 member delegation was the only group that did  not stand when the past and current  first ladies of our land entered.  Other anti-IWY groups stood but did  not clap. It was the first time that  Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford and Lady  Bird Johnson had made an appearance together.  The few men present were media  personnel or observers except for  five of the delegates elected at  the Mississippi State Conference  which the Ku Klux Klan claimed it  dominated. Though only 35  of the  women of this state are White, no  Black delegate was elected. The  National Commission registered  displeasure that some delegations  were not representative of all types  of women but the elections were not  declared fraudulent.  As the Conference progressed  the chism became more evident. The  only resolution accepted unanimously concerned credit and urged  vigorous, efficient and expeditious  enforcement of The Federal Equal  Credit Opportunity Act of 197U. The  26 resolutions were presented in alphabetical order. They included 16  resolutions from the first National  Commission and amendments and new  resolutions from the state meetings  and the 1977 National Commission.  They dealt with arts and humanities,  battered women, business, child  abuse, child care, credit, disabled women, education, elective  1. w. Y.  Houston  Siuan  8.

A substitute resolution formulated and re ad.by minority women  was accepted. Also, one prepared  by handicapped women was read by  a woman in a wheelchair. The proposal for a cabinet level women's  department was defeated and a  resolution passed to continue a  National Women's Commission.  On all but the credit resolution,  the Indiana 31 voted no or did not  vote. The latter occurred when  their chair(Joan Gubbins) who was  also floor leader of the anti-IWY  forces was elsewhere and not present  to wave her red or green flag indicating how they were to vote.  Often these Indiana delegates were  talking to each other instead of  listening to or participating in  the debate. The various presiding  officers made every effort to  facilitate debate, at times changing the rules to give the opposition more opportunities to make  motions or express their views.  They were outnumbered which made  them feel oppressed.  It is doubtful if many of the  delegates or observers agreed  100  on every point in the resolutions. Broad areas were covered in  a short time. They were voting on  Conference  recommendations, not laws. Some  require only the enforcement of  existing laws or the fairer distribution of funds. To implement  others, new laws are needed which  is not easily done.  Misinterpretation of the resolutions is rampant. Some corrections  of the most publicized ones are:  Child Care does not mean federally funded centers for all small  children. It specifies ability-  to-pay fee schedules, voluntary  participation and parental involvement. Only the federal  government has the power to offer  the suggested tax incentives to  business, industry or unions to  provide such centers. Government  licensing is needed to protect the  children.  Reproductive Freedom does not  necessarily mean abortion which  no one thinks is the best or ultimate solution to unwanted pregnancies.  If some of the extreme interpretations have you confused, read the  National Commissions Report,  To  Form a More Perfect Union.  It has  been available in our public libraries for over a year, is possessed by  by most persons who attended the  Indiana Conference or can be ordered  from the U.S. Government Printing  Office.  The main objections of the anti-  IWY faction seemed to stem from fear  of government control and increased  taxes. The IWY Conferences have been  much less liberally funded than  government conferences of a similar  scope. Without the donations of  time and money by volunteers, they  would have been impossible. Many  of the resolutions concern changes  in attitudes rather than funding.  Some estimate all costs of enacting the resolutions would be less  than a week of our military budget.  Despite the strong feeling of  difference among those attending  the Conference their behavior was  exemplary. The Houston police,  taxi drivers and convention  personnel said they had never had  a better behaved large convention.  In her keynote address, Congress-  woman Barbara Jordan, Texas, said  quoting Isaiah,  Come now, let us  reason together  and added,  there  is no difference this body cannot  resolve if we give and share.

        <pagetext>2.  WOMANKIND  Miami    Beach  passes    ERA  The City Commission of Miami Beach, hurt by a  convention boycott imposed by women that support the  ERA, passed its own Equal Rights ordinance in  January, 1981.   One commissioner predicted the  local level action could have a  steamroller effect   for ERA.  Hotel owners and business groups, anticipating  over a  150 million loss over the next decade because  of the boycott urged the city to adopt the ordinance to  revive trade the community lost when Florida rejected  the ERA.  The National Organization for Women has led the  boycott of Florida and the 14 other states that have  not ratified the Equal Rights Amendment.  Over 350 organizations have refused to hold conventions and meetings in Florida.   Among those:  AFL-CIO, United Steel Workers, American Association of University Women, and the Democratic  National Convention.   We pushed an ordinance that was not passed by the  state legislature or the U. S. Congress.   We did what  was in our power to eliminate sex discrimination in our  city,   Commissioner Alex Daoud said.   We predict that our actions will have a steamroller  effect that will spread to the grassroots level across the  country.   It will not only put pressure on the state government, but on congress and the President  Daoud said.  Eleanor Smeal, president of NOW, said the  commission's action demonstrated the  vitality of the  equal rights for women drive and the grass roots support  for the Equal Rights Amendment.    The National Organization for Women ordered a  boycott of Florida and 14 other states which have not  approved the Equal Rights Amendment.   We will continue the convention boycott of unratified states, including Florida.   However, there is  increasing pressure to devise new boycotts because so  many people want to actively participate in the movement,   Smeal said.  NOW is looking for new boycott methods to hit those  areas of the state holding back ratification. Smeal said  the  Miami Beach action gives impetus to that new effort.  The municipal measure was passed and became a  city law on January 21, 1981.  K. traxe. o*  3n.  xfex to Vtve. tAVa.Tnl 'BeiacVv City Commission might be in order.

With violence against women at a height,  and the possibility of global warfare ever more present,  communication among women is critical to our very  survival.   Media women and media-concerned women  describe their groups, periodicals, and resources in  this directory.  With this resource now available  women have a  valuable tool to strengthen existing networking.  Writers can contact writers groups, or locate publishers and periodicals to submit materials.   Presses  can locate women's bookstores and vice versa.  Film groups can contact distributors.   Women with  regular radio and TV programs can contact music  groups for material.   This annually-updated directory  assures accuracy of information -- addresses, phone  numbers, contact persons, as well as specific information such as subscription rates - -  all submitted by  the women themselves.  The second half of the Index/ Directory consists of  the annotated index of the 1977 through 1980 issues  of Media Report to Women.   This index of media  research and activities --in over 100 different categories --  provides a wealth of information, particularly valuable to those doing research, writing articles,  or delivering talks on any aspect of women's communications and mass media.  So interesting are the various entries from women  across the globe that it makes fascinating reading  simply learning what women are doing, apart from  its usefulness as a directory of women's media.  To order a copy, send  8 to the Women's Institute  for Freedom of the Press (WIFP), 3306 Ross Place,  N. W., Washington, DC 20008 (202) 966-7783.  WIFP is a non-profit, tax -exempt research and  publishing organization concerned with the expansion  and restructuring of the communications system in  order for media to be in the hands of all people,  not just the wealthy.   The Index/Directory of Women's  Media has been published annually since 1975 to aid  networking and increase communication among  women nationally and internationally.  Radcliffe College to Develop Women's  Community Program  Radcliffe College has been awarded a  250, 000  grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to help local communities develop programs  about women.   The project, entitled  Women in the  Community: Where Were They?   Where Are They?  Where Are They Going?  will enable the Schlesinger  Library to work with public libraries in seven communities throughout the country to prepare these  programs for local audiences.   The Arthur and Elizabeth  Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in  America is the largest, best-known, and most  comprehensive research library on women in the  country. (WOMANKIND is proud to be in this library.)   Radcliffe College is pleased to participate in a  program that will share with the public the rich  resources of the Schlesinger Library. We welcome  the opportunity to work with local libraries in  creating public awareness of the contributions of  women in their own communities,   commented  Radcliffe College President Matina Homer.

Recent scholarship about women is providing  dramatic evidence of women's past and present  contributions, information that should not be confined within academic settings, but should be made  available to the public. By offering lectures, readings,  panel discussions, and films, public libraries can  provide free access to current information about  women,  said Haber.  The programs will be planned by local teams  sponsored by a public library in each of the communities selected.   Each team must include a  public librarian, an academic librarian, a member  of a community organization, and a women's studies  scholar.  These teams are invited to apply to a training  session to be held at the Schlesinger Library in  August, 1981. The sessions will include a discussion  of how new knowledge about women is changing the  perception of history and other academic disciplines,  as well as training and practice in program planning  and reaching the public.  After the training, the teams will return to their  communities to plan and implement a series of  programs to take place between February and July,  1982.   A coordinator from Radcliffe will work with  the teams throughout this period.   Seven teams will  be selected nationally.  Travel expenses, room, and board will be provided  for each of the participants in the training session.  In addition, the sponsoring public libraries will be  eligible for grants to meet the costs of delivering  these community programs.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  The Liberation of Men in Coodavben  by BARBARA JONES  Indianapolis, Indiana  Dwelling in that mystical place known to very few and  with the magical name of Coodavben are several  goddesses.   These goddesses were created by the women  of Coodavben to n-eet their deepest needs.  At mis very moment these six goddesses are sitting  near the peak of Mt. Voluptuous.   They are the  goddess of self, the goddess of vanity, the goddess of  riches, the goddess of desire, the goddess of matrimony, and the goddess of motherhood.   They are  discussing a matter that could very well revolutionize Coodavben.  It is important to realize that these are not your  magical, mystical, thunderbolt types of goddesses.  Heaven forbid    These are modern, scientific  goddesses, who use only the latest methods, some  even more advanced than those of their own culture,  a culture where women play the dominant role.  Today's meeting concerns test tube babies (quite  common in Coodavben for over thirty years with  reliable and respected results.) This session is focused on one particular test tube baby, created  twenty-one years ago by these goddesses.   At that  time they selected the genes for the perfect male,  which was to be a model for all future males.   A  special committee chose genes that would give him  the personal magnetism of John Kennedy, the oratorical power of Howard Baker, the wit of Art Buchwald.  the boyish charm of Robert Redford,   the physique of  Burt Reynolds, the charming smile and dimply chin of  Cary Grant, the dark, wavy hair of a young James  Garner, the genius of Stevie Wonder, the talent of Johnny Mathis, and the baby blue eyes of Paul Newman.  The goddesses did not rely solely on genes. Realizing  the importance environment would play in the development of the perfect male, they turned him over to four  godmothers --each representing one of the workHs major  races.  Cyd, the head goddess, instructed these godmothers to:   Concentrate on making him eager and willing to please.    Each of the four godmothers, however, had her idea of  perfection. Each reinforced in the growing boy all the best  qualities connected with her own culture. Thus he grew up  a combination of strength, wisdom patience, and compassion.  When the boy became 20,  Cyd visited him.  She soon  realized that,  for him to fit her concept of the perfect  male, he would have to receive her instructions. So  she arranged a special ceremony to  lay down the law   to him.  And, today, this twenty-year-old bundle of desirable qualities is ready to be instructed in the  commandments for living by all these divine goddesses.  These commandments will be issued in biblical style  so they will seem to have authority from God Almighty,  in all Her eternal wisdom.  The ceremony begins as the lovely-to-look-at  masculine creation enters the midst of all the divine  beings.   The greatest goddess of them all, Cyd, with  dominion over self, issues these commandments to  this man, the ideal for all future men in Coodavben.  These are her commandments:   Thou shalt be exalted, placed on a pedestal in the  highest place of honor possible   right between the flag  and apple pie.   Thou shalt, however, come down from thy pedestal  for certain duties, such as washing dishes, making beds,  preparing meals, mopping floors, and scrubbing toilets.  Thou shalt bear in mind, however, that, no matter how  industrious thou shalt be during the day, thou shalt always be gorgeous by night. Therefore, thou shalt diligently protect thy lily-white hands, so they may remain soft enough to stroke the tender face of thy wife.   Thou shalt never have headaches.   Thou shalt never become bossy; bossiness is unbecoming to a man.   Rather, thou shalt achieve thy  ends by manipulation, becoming so adept that thou  shalt never reveal thy power over women.   Toward  this end, thou hast been created with those baby blue  eyes   to wink, blink, and flutter in helpless bewilderment.   Thou shalt not expect equal rights. Verily, thou  shalt never expect equal pay for equal work.   Further*-  more, thou, as the inferior being thou art, shalt never  expect a skilled job or management position that  carries dignity and respect.   Rather thou shalt be content with the menial, the non-supervisory, the boring.  Thou shalt be deliriously grateful and contented for  the limited rights already granted you by the illustrious  women of Coodavben in moments of weakness and  irrationality.   And thou, being fully aware of thy inferiority, shalt never expect more and shalt realize the  ridiculousness of any attempt on thy part to attain a  high position in business or government.   Most importantly, thou shalt never expect to become leader of  our country.   Verily, I say unto thee, there shalt  NEVER be artMR. President  in Coodavbenl   If thou dost not need to work to supplement thy  wife's income, thou shalt forsake all talents and  have utter faith in thy wife's promise to cherish thee,  to forsake all others, and to provide for thee   at  least until such time as thy head shalt become bald  or thy belly shalt go to pot, at which time she shalt  naturally and justifiably leave thee for a younger,  more attractive man.   Thou shalt, however, never consider these possibilities, but shalt remain pure in heart.   Therefore,  if thy wife shalt take a lover, thou shalt never know,  for thou shalt have absolute and everlasting trust in  thy mate.   Furthermore, if thy wife's lover shalt wake  thee in the early morning hours, proclaiming his passion  and all-consuming desire for thy wife, thou shalt assume  he is merely a misguided soul, mistaking passionate  dreams for realities.   Thou shalt not blame thy wife for any infidelity.  Rather, if indisputable facts proving thy wife's infidelity are poured upon thy head, thou shalt be understanding, knowing that thou must somehow have provoked such behavior and realizing that mortal woman  was never meant to be faithful to just one man.   In  support of this, the illustrious leader of Coodavbeen  hath assured us that lust   especially in the heart   is  unavoidable, even for a righteous person such as she.  And other exalted mortal advisers, hath assured us  that:' All women's cheating and lusting is only natural  and is merely an attempt to free sex from Puritanical  hangups.'   Thus it follows, as the night the day, that,  while women are making sex seem so right and so  beautiful, they must include some sinfulness to make  it interesting and desirable.   Therefore, if thy wife  desireth to chain thee, beat thee, swap thee, or  clothe thee in fetishes, thou shalt be perfectly submissive   or rebellious    whichever createth the  greater sense of sin and wrongdoing and thus createth  the most beautiful and free kind of sex.   If thou art obedient in all these things, thy wife  shalt bear thee a son who shalt assist thee in all thy  chores.   Furthermore, if thou art exceptionally  virtuous, thou shalt have daughters.   However, thou  shalt never request aid with thy chores from thy  daughters, whose roles in life require that they, as the  superior species of human, shalt not serve but rather  shalt be served.   Thou shalt ...   Suddenly, before Cyd could issue the tenth com -  mandment, Mount Voluptuous began to shake.   From  its very core, a volcano erupted, bringing forth, in hot,  molten lava, two men created by the smoldering  spirits of the downtrodden masculine gender during  centuries of inequality.  Full of fire and determination, Bobby Freedman  and Georgio Steerem, newly-formed liberators and  defenders of all men, militantly marched toward the  center of Coodavben to begin their fight for justice  and equality, a fight that may finally mean an end  to pedestals, discrimination, double standards, and  the constant flutter of baby-blues.  A    Flapper's      Companionate  Marriage   by CORDELLE K. BALLARD  West Haven, Connecticut  Looking back on my role as a flapper in the aftermath of World War I and before the Depression, I  conclude that I made my way through the tangle  of those times with some awkwardness, but with a  fair degree of satisfaction as far as my personal life  was concerned.  I realize now that I was a natural-born  feminist,   and my expectations of  woman's liberation  were  formed in what was called the  roaring twenties.    In the vanguard of those  demanding changes in  relationships between the sexes, the flapper of the  20's wanted to be independent of the males who  ruled the family.   However, she found that she  could not differ with the men who ruled her life      unless she could support herself and was free to walk  out. And, in seeking a job she met with discrimination because she was a woman.   It was a man's  world, and woman's place in it was ordained by  him.  By the time I was married at age 29, I had  learned what a girl brought up in a comfortable  home had to face if she was serious about standing  on her own feet.   My education had been aimed  towards a career as a concert pianist.   After two  years of college I was forced to change my thinking.  The war had destroyed much of my father's business and for the first time I realized that although I  needed to be self-supporting, I was unprepared to  earn my living.   I was a year or more away from  graduation.   If I made music my vocation, it would  be difficult making a place in that field.   I had no  idea that I could succeed, and I needed to go to work  at once, and not be a burden to my family.  After numerous efforts to get a job (always against  my father's wishes), I soon learned that I was  qualified for nothing.   By a fluke, I was accepted  for training by the American Red Cross and was given  a chance to prove myself.  Social work was a congenial occupation and for the  next few years I alternated between earning academic  credits and working to acquire practical experience.  From the moment I left home for that first job I was  self-supporting and after six or seven years I had a  firm foundation in my profession.  Along with other flappers of my generation, I bobbed  my hair (again against my father's wishes) and adopted  short skirts.   My circle knew about Freud or at least we  thought we did.   Our entertainment was geared to ragtime  and jazz.   We danced like 'jitterbugs' or daringly cheek to cheek.   We had friends who made wine  in their bathtubs, and we knew how to gain admittance  to speakeasies.   Freedom for women was in the air  and to prove it, we chain-smoked whether we liked  it or not.  We talked about equality of the sexes, but I was  unable to secure a job that paid me what a man was  paid for the same work.  My friends and acquaintances wanted to shake the  myths of woman's place in man's world, but some  were forced to succumb to the tradition that marriage  was their only destination.   In the South where I was  brought up it was assumed that every girl's father  would support her until she was married, at which  time he would turn her over to her spouse for support.  If she could not attract a good provider, she was  obliged to become a spinster employed at some  menial job.   The flapper refused to accept this  myth of woman's inferiority, and was accused of  playing an  unwomanly role  when she tried to buck  the masculine prejudice against career women. Some  young men who considered themselves modern were  able to reject the common assumption of female  inferiority, and were not threatened by female  career- competition.  When I finally decided to marry, I chose a man  who had liberated himself from the traditional  views of his family, and who wanted the kind of  partnership I felt should be the goal of marriage.  We agreed we would pursue our respective professions  (he was a naval architect), and would share our  lives on an equal basis.   We were both free from the  notions we had grown up with, and had abandoned the  assumptions about men and women which had come  down from the past.  The year before our marriage, THE COMPANIONATE MARRIAGE, the cataclysmic book by  Judge Ben Lindsey of the Denver Domestic Relations Court, had become the talk of town.   We  felt the book stated clearly the case for desirable  male and female relationships in a marriage of  equals.   We recommended the book to our friends  and bought and distributed copies where we hoped  the ideas would be influential.  Continued to Page 4

        <pagetext>4.  WOMANKIND  Flapper  Continued from Page 3  Recently it occurred to me to reread the book and  see just what had intrigued me and my husband so  much that we had subscribed wholeheartedly to  Judge Lindsey's thesis.   Looking back fifty years later,  after eighteen years of marriage that ended in a  divorce, it seems that companionate marriage did  not replace the traditional marriage.  In the preface to THE COMPANIONATE MARRIAGE  the author begins with a definition:    Companionate  marriage is a legal marriage with legal birth control,  and with the right to divorce by mutual consent for  childless couples, usually without payment of  matrimony.    The author goes on to say,  Companionate marriage is already an established social fact  in this country.   It is conventionally respectable.  The sophisticated are, without incurring social reproach, everywhere practicing birth control, and are  also obtaining collusive divorce outside the law whenever they want it.   They will continue the practice  and no amount of prohibitive legislation can stop them.    Judge Lindsey wanted men and women to enter  marriage, under conditions that would best insure  the success and permanence of their partnership,  and would also afford a line of retreat in case the  marriage failed.   He said the couple should not have  children until they could be reasonably sure of their  ability to carry on together - and not until they  could afford them.  Critics accused the author of promoting trial  marriages, which he denied.   Companionate marriage  was a legal marriage which could become a family  marriage should the couple desire procreation.   He  had no objection to premarital sex which had always  existed clandestinely.   He thought the unmarried union  preferable to immature and unfit marriage lacking  the seeds of permanence.   He stated flatly there was no  need for an increased number of marriages, nor a decrease in divorces, but for a change for the better in  the quality of marriages.   He said:    They (marriages)  ought to be constructed so carefully, and under conditions as free from the confusion and blindness of mere  eroticism and romantic love, that their permanence  would be reasonably assured.    In his discussion of marriage and morals, Judge  Lindsey noted a change in the pop ular attitude  toward adultery.   Adultery was originally included  in some ancient marriages as a male privilege.  Women were excluded.   In Lindsey's day women were  more openly at odds with this double standard sex code.  Lindsey deplored the ignorance of sex, and hoped  that society would accept the notion that beginning  with the children, people should be taught  the facts  of life.    He wrote,  Since love is an art, sex life is  likewise an art, and should be taught as such.   He  found the bungling and terrible stupidity and ignorance  of men and women in their physical and spiritual relationships very shocking.   He thought men and women must love each other as personalities first, and  as men and women second.   To quote Lindsey,  I  sometimes feel that ninety percent of the mountainous misery in the world is due to our lack of education in these matters.   Lindsey did not hide his  light under a bushel.   He took on any religious leader who would appear  on the platform with him.   He gave lectures, and  he held debates on the material in his books.   It is  interesting how much of what he recommended then  has become the order of the day and how much still  remains outside the mainstream of our culture.  Change comes slowly and is introduced in practice  by a few pioneers, but the bulk of humanity seems  to live outside the gates of knowledge.   So much of  what Lindsey discusses in his books has not received  acceptance on any large scale.   The past is like an  undertow pulling back the future while the present  struggles with outmoded beliefs.  In the fifty years since I embraced Lindsey's  ideas marriage laws remain the same--until death  do us part.   Divorce can be secured a bit more easily  if you choose the right  grounds.     The idea of no-  fault divorce for couples without children is still  looked at askance.   Birth control information can be  disseminated but it is still beyond the means and out  of the reach of many women and men.   Contraceptive  advice and devices cost too much for the poor.   A-  bortion, as the last resort when other means of contraception fail, is the battle royal of these times.  Sex education is not readily embraced and is often  fought against in some quarters.  We can say that sexual freedom has increased for  both men and women.   But, premarital sex has always existed, it is just more open today.   Although  the term is not used the idea of companionate  marriage is more congenial to the youth of today and  society is being forced to sanction it.   Family  marriage, which Lindsey saw as an outgrowth of the  legal Companionate Marriage, gives status to partnerships dedicated to bearing and bringing up children.  Companionate Marriage as practiced by today's sophisticates resembles the traditional marriage, but it  is not dictated by society; it is chosen by the persons  who favor it.   Judge Lindsey saw it as the modern legal  contract for those couples who desire a permanent relationship, whether or not they intend to have children.  At the time I married, some scholars had spoken out  about the planet's inability to provide enough food for  the global population.   The subject was not generally  discussed as young people were more interested in a-  chieving happiness in their personal relationships.   I  was acquainted with Margaret Sanger's views about  birth control and was working to try to establish  clinics at the time she was going to jail for her  activities.  I had been brought up to look forward to having a  family; it was taken for granted.   But by the time I  married my social work experience had made a serious  dent on my earlier assumptions.   I was influenced even  more by my husband's distaste for the kind of family  life he had experienced.   He was skeptical about  bringing children into the world unless they could be  provided for not only financially, but with an environment in which they could grow and have some  hope of reaching their highest potential.   He felt  some people were not capable of providing the love  and care required for a child's development.  I realized I was freer to pursue my profession than I  would be if I followed the pattern of the past which led  to inevitable motherhood.   I was not deterred when my  best friend told me that a woman needed to have a child  in order to be  fulfilled.    I recognized the view as one  of the self-serving aspects of centuries of traditional beliefs designed to enforce the role of motherhood.   For  me, marriage and motherhood had become voluntary  options rather than manifest destiny.  Even then I thought a child had the right to have two  parents who planned together for the child's development as an individual.   I felt there was a lack of respect for the child when, as my grandmother said, she  was an accident of love.   I knew that when marriage  was instituted it was meant to assure the legitimacy of  the father's progeny, to insure that his own blood would  inherit his worldly goods.   At the same time a husband  was allowed more sexual freedom, while his wife's sexual freedom was prohibited or frowned upon.   Although  methods of birth control were known to the elite at least  as far back as Casanova, the belief that man's status was  enhanced by the number of his progeny remained undisturbed .  Down through history, a child was considered merely  a happenstance of adult living unless he was the male  heir.   Others who survived babyhood were almost ignored,  They were often considered inadequate workers, but  their labor was made use of until this century when work  opportunities began to shrink.   Then laws were enacted  to prohibit child labor as men wanted the jobs which did  exist.  Society assumes that family life revolves around the  child, but sets no qualifications for those who become  parents.   I thought that certain preconditions needed to  exist to provide a child a fair chance to develop into a  human being capable of carrying on when her or his  parents were no longer around.   My husband agreed.  Observing the expectations of society is still the  pattern of behavior of both sexes who try to live up  to marriage customs which no longer fit the conditions of their lives.   Men still assume the role of  good provider and  head of household  even when  they cannot fulfil these obligations.   In many cases  the work of the wife is needed to adequately take care  of the family.   Women stick to the rules which have  governed the  second sex  for fear of failing to please  the men.   Many members of both sexes still seem to  consider woman's ability to please men as her fairest  asset.   Some changes can be noted with career women  who think that pleasing men is less important than it  used to be.  Children still have their behavior frozen into roles  that were appropriate to past situations, because the  women who bring them up are still inclined to obsolete behavior.   Women's Liberation calls this one  of the greatest barriers to sex equality.   Many women  hang on to past customs as a means of securing a  special place in the world by seeking approbation  t*z Helaine Vidtoria Press 2*  4080 Dynasty Lane   D-WK  Martinsville, IN. 46151  Phone: 317-537-2868  Since 1973 - Specialists in Postcards  on Women in History - Past   Present  p* JOCELYN COHEN    NANCY POORE  To receive a catalog, send 300 in coins or stamps.  from men as they were taught to do in generations  past.   Some women want to appeal for this special  protection as long as possible, for fear they would  not have the power to deal with a changed relationship  to their men.   Many wives are content with the slow  rate of social change.   But in spite of themselves,  continuing changes will make them more radical.  As for the men a change of attitude has appeared  since Abigail Adams told her husband, the President  of the United States, to  Remember the Ladies.   He  laughed at that because he happened to believe that  not only women and children, but men without property lacked the judgment to vote.   Over the years a  number of outspoken women took their stand against  the inequality which existed between the sexes.  One man made himself famous by writing a thesis  on  The Subjection of Women.  When John Stuart  Mill met Harriet Taylor, one of the most emancipated women of her day, he supported strongly her  most radical and advanced ideas about the status of  women.   When he married her, he made a formal protest against the marriage law on his own behalf, repudiating any pretensions to have acquired any rights  whatever by virtue of his marriage to her.   His well  reasoned arguments had no strength against the hard  core of the myth which had established the supremacy  of men.  I dare say that even after this proposed Equal Rights  Amendment is enacted, there will be a lag in the  acceptance of the freedom it will provide, and a  psychological lag which affects both sexes.   A man's  set of mind conditions him to feel that a woman must  be kept dependent on him lest she become his boss.  A man does not like working for a woman foFfear of  the power she may gain over him.   Accustomed to  holding the position of dominance, he will consciously and unconsciously endeavor to preserve the  unequal status between the sexes.   Already some men  are frightened as they realize that they can no longer  refuse the demands of the more rebellious women.  If female weakness is transformed into female power,  what sacrifices will this new world demand of men?  After women are  liberated  it will become clear  that men need liberation even more.   They, too, have  been taught their roles.   They will find it hard to accept  other roles.  Why not try a relationship based on reciprocity, where  in each individual contributes to the partnership from  her or his store of talents, what will best satisfy mutual  needs and wishes?  An enduring love relationship between a man and a  woman is based on a combination of personal traits, dispositions, and outlooks, enhanced by sex.   Mutual  attraction of personalities and the sharing of mutual  goals are the most worthwhile foundation for a   marriage  relationship between two people, without  the compulsion of sex.   The sterotypical roles for men  and women handed down by past cultures can be  eliminated in favor of a reciprocal partnership  based on the unique qualities each individual finds  in the other.   Freedom to live in variable ways, a  according to choice, will bring satisfaction which  can never be achieved by a stereotyped  equality   measured on the basis of gender.  Present day youth indicates that it sees alternative  ways of thinking.   Perhaps the myth of man's world  and woman's place in it does not hang like an  albatross around their shoulders.  I know that my generation has little to offer youth  and the women of today except support in their endeavors to meet and dispose of problems we have bequeathed them.  My life was shaped by the notions of the flapper that  I was.   Experience has changed some of my views.   The  idea of Companionate Marriage is not enough   it is  only a beginning.   Human beings are on the point of  discovering more interesting relationships than have  ever been envisioned in the past when youth's expectations were forcibly restricted to a world divided by sex.  The split between man's and woman's place can no  longer serve when people are valued for themselves as  persons, each harboring a unique variety of character  traits.   We can have a world of personalities with roles  unassigned by society, with roles left to individual  choice based on individual endowment.  Life should be looked at whole.  I feel I would like to see a total reassessment of  worldwide goals, looking on an existence for everyone  based on affection instead of war.  I would like to join hands with youth, still uncon-  taminated by experience, to ascertain what betterments can be made in the human condition.  I believe that those of us who are about to become  ancestors should support those who are about to inherit the earth as we have made it.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Homage to   Two Women  by ROBERTA LYNCH  At the end of 1980 Dorothy Day died, and I went  to hear Adrienne Rich read her poetry.   A few other  things happened in those final months of that first  year of the decade, but you have already heard about  those events and I'm not sure what good it would do  to add my lament to the chorus that's been raised.  Dorothy Day was the leading figure of the Catholic  Worker movement, a woman who spent the better  part of her life actively witnessing against all forms  of violence.   She lived among and she served society's  cast-offs.   Adrienne Rich is one of our most distin -  guished living poets.   She is noted as much for her  radical feminism as for her literary prowess.   Both  women however, are minor figures on the nation's  cultural/political landscape     their names unknown  to the great majority of Americans.  I suppose I prefer to think about them now because  they offer a kind of hope that seems a small light in  a dark time.   I have been thinking about their --as  far as I know unacknowledged     meaning for each  other.   And about their meaning for our society, our  movements, and our times.  Most obviously, they are both women.   And they  are bound by the fact of being female in a time  transition, when roles were being reexamined and  redefined.  Dorothy Day was not by her own lights a feminist.  At times she even seemed hostile to the women's  movement.   But she was a woman unafraid to stand  up publicly for what she believed, willing to assume  leadership     in her own anarchistic way -- and  able to inspire and motivate others.   All this within  the framework of a religion that has for centuries  denigrated and feared women's power.   The very  presence of Dorothy Day was for thousands of women      and men     a challenge to the myths of female  inferiority.  Adrienne Rich's feminism, on the other hand, is  at the heart of her work.   However, with her sweeping tejection of all of patriarchial society, Rich may  have more in common with Day's vigorous anti-  statism than she does with Gloria Steinem's political  reformism.   For Rich, feminism exists outside of  culture, even outside of civilization -- as we know  it.   It must create its own forms of expression, even  of being, if it is to avoid corruption by male values  and institutions.   Tnis is not unlike Day's Caur.oY.ic  Worker communities with their attempt to create  self-sustaining entities and to make their beliefs live  in their ranks.  But perhaps what joins Day and Rich more profoundly than anything else is their fierce opposition  to all forms of violence.   Although it has very  different sources for each of them, they both come  round to seeing the varieties of violence   from  the daily degradations to the global menace     as  the primary symptom of a diseased social system.  In one of Rich's most impressive poems,  Natural  Resources,   she quotes an Irish peace leader:  We have lived with violence for seven years  It was not worth one single life      And in her earlier collection, Diving into the Wreck,  the sense of a world perverted by rampant violence  is present in many poems.   It is expressed most  strongly and succinctly when she writes of:  ... a world masculinity made unfit  for women or men  Rich's anger and her art are fueled by the conviction that the violence of patriarchal society threatens  the very survival of the human species.  Dorothy Day was possessed of an equally passionate  belief in the threat that violence posed for humanity's  future.   Not only did she consistently oppose all wars,  but she was among the earliest and most vehement  opponents of the arms race and nuclear weaponry.  She went to jail coutless times for her protests, but  she never wavered in her determination to actively  resist the military madness.  Both Rich and Day are in a certain sense  absolutists      and not only in the eyes of their detractors.  There are many feminists who think Rich too extreme  in her antipathy toward everything  male,   in her  sweeping condemnations of all of our societal  structures.   There are many Catholics who find Day's  interpretation of the Christian message too purist,  too demanding.   And many peace activists find  her thorough-going pacifism too politically impractical -- not a program likely to win votes in Congress  or influence the conduct of foreign affairs.  It would be easy enough to see these women only  in this light -- moralists divorced from the world of  realpolitick.   And in this post-November gloom,  when moderation is starting to look left-wing, people  like Dorothy Day or Adrienne Rich may seem like  the last thing we need.  Yet I think it's important not to lose sight of what  figures such as these provide for us.   For it may be  precisely at times like these that we need them most.  One need not subscribe to Day's anarchism or agree  with Rich's patriarchal analysis in order to realize  their value.  First there is the matter of vision.   Everyone's  saying it now: what the left needs is renewed vision.  Yet we forget that it is often necessary for ideas to  be formulated in their most radical form before they  can be refined and filtered through the prism of  practical politics.   This doesn't mean that every  extreme idea is a good one.   But it does mean that  there has to be space for the visionary, the person  not bound by convention, or rigid ideology, or  narrow constituency, who can forge out of experience  and conviction new possibilities.   We can then make  of that what we will.  Although there may be only a few feminists who  are ready to sign up for Rich's matriarchalism, there  are probably many thousands who have been sustained  by her firm insistence on female identity and shaped  by her sharp questioning of all sexual conventions.  And there are today scores of Christian activists --  in the urban neighborhoods of the U. S. A. and in the  peasant communities of Latin America - - who took  their inspiration from Day's commitment to living  out her beliefs.  Secondly, there may be matters --or moments --  that call for moral absolutism.   Take the issue of  violence, in particular the military escalation upon  which we seem to be about to embark.   The silence  which greets each new outbreak of rearmament fever  seems almost deafening.   The standard reactions seem  inane in their complacency.   Perhaps the threat of  nuclear holocaust toward which we are spiraling  merits the kind of apocalyptic vocabulary of an  Adrienne Rich.   And perhaps the installation of a  new secretary of state who insists that we have to  let the Soviet Union know that we won't shun  atomic war requires the kind of active resistance of  a Dorothy Day.  I have written these words in part to pay homage  to two women with whom I have greatly disagreed  and greatly admired.   But also in the hope that we  will make room in our midst for others like them  who offer us not a correct strategy but a challenge,  not clear answers, but important questions.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Emma Goldman : Live Tonight Premieres in Indianapolis  Lynn Cohen as Emma Goldman. (Photo compliments  of IRT)  Good    News    About    Jenna  On February 3, 1981 WOMANKIND was informed  that Jenna Kelsie had been notified (a few days earlier)  that she is being granted a re-trial through the  Federal Courts.  The trial is to take place within six months.   If it  does not, Kelsie will be automatically released.  Kelsie was convicted of  second degree murder  and has been incarcerated since November 22, 1976  serving a 15 to 25 year sentence.  She killed her ex-husband on October 6, 1973  when he was assaulting her by beating her and trying  to bite her eyes out.  Contact Ann-Marie Kennedy at 1918 Lazy Creek  Drive in Muncie, Indiana (47302) if you would  like to contribute to a Help Jenna Kelsie Fund.  The So-Called  Human Life Amendment  Section 1. With respect to the right to life, the  word person as used in this article and in the Fifth  and Fourteenth Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of the United States applies to all human  beings irrespective of age, health, function or  condition of dependency, including their unborn  offspring at every stage of their biological development.  Section 2.   No unborn person shall be deprived of  life by any person, provided however, that nothing  in this article shall prohibit a law permitting only  those medical procedures required to prevent the  death of the mother.  Section 3.   The Congress and the several states  have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.  Opponents of reproductive rights wasted no time  in beginning a new campaign to overturn the Supreme Court ruling of 1973. They proposed the   HLA  - the so-called Human Life Amendment.  The HLA would not just ban abortion or make it  criminal as it was between the 1860's and 1973;  it would declare fertilized eggs and fetuses   persons  under the U. S. Constitution.   Theoretically, the HLA would entitle them to the same  rights and responsibilities of living persons.   The  impact is to make the rights of a fertilized egg  superior to the rights of a woman.  Proponents and opponents alike agree that the  HLA requires the fetus to be considered a person  even when no one, not even the pregnant woman,  knows it exists.   From the moment of conception  (when the sperm enters the ova in the fallopian  tube) there would be a  person  in existence as  defined by the HLA.  Birth control methods could also be threatened  under the HLA.   The two most widely used birth  control mehtods, other than sterilization, are  the Pill and Intrauterine Device (IUD).   Low-  estrogen birth control pills are considered safer for  women and are the most frequently prescribed form  of the Pill.   Since the IUD and low-estrogen pills  work, in some instances, by preventing the implantation of the fertilized egg, it is clear that  they would have to be illegal under the HLA.  Reprinted from WOMANSIGHT, January, 1981.  The world premiere of LIVE TONIGHT:   EMMA  GOLDMAN took place on February 27, 1981 in Indianapolis at the Indiana Repertory Theatre.  Emma Goldman, who devoted her life to championing  the causes of individual freedom in the United States,  was the inspiration for playwright Michael Dixon's  drama.  Goldman, an early advocate of women's rights,  draft evasion, free love and nonviolent revolution,  is portrayed by Lynn Cohen.   The role of Heiner is  played by Ralph Elias.   Both do a splendid job.  Before the play opens various radio programs of the  period are heard.   Then women's voices sing the  women's anthem:  Bread and Roses.    The song sets  the mood before Emma Goldman makes her entrance.  To capsulize the immensity of Goldman's passion  and dedication to the turn of the century anarchist  movement, Dixon dramatized a two week period in  her life, which she spent in Toronto with a young  blind anarchist, Frank Heiner. Goldman, who was  25 years older than Heiner, had several love affairs  during her lifetime ; Heiner was one of those.  Dixon was commissioned to create the drama from  an idea initiated by IRT Artistic Director Tom Haas  and Literary Manager Janet Allen.  The new play is directed by Lynne Gould-Guerra,  who has a penchant for staging original plays.   Last  year she was awarded an Off Broadway Show Business  Critics Circle Award for her direction of WINE  UNTOUCHED at the Harold Clurman Theatre.  EMMA GOLDMAN:   LIVE TONIGHT is available  for reading and production through the Indiana Repertory  Theatre.   For more information contact Janet Allen  IRT, 140 W.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  How Not To Write A  How - To  Article  KIDS     and    School     Projects-Ugg   by  PAT  HEIDENREICH  I'm living with expert put-er off-ers.  Having delayed until the last minute, my seventh  grader and a classmate worked feverishly on a joint  project for Ancient History.   Using a flat piece of  wood for a base, they attempted to construct a  coliseum with grey clay.   But the walls kept tumbling  down and the friend had to go home, so they persuaded me to write a note requesting a one day  extension.  Their teacher delivered a maxi-lecture about  procrastination being the thief of time, but finally  said O. K.  That night construction resumed and soon was  accompanied by a loud commotion.  From my vantage point on the top of the basement  stairs, I saw clayballs whizzing through the air and  heard much name calling.   What's going on down there?  I yelled.   The dumb little creep said our coliseum stinks     If you're referring to your brother, tell him to get  up here     I followed this with a few threats I won't  repeat and things quieted down.  After the friend went home again, I asked how the  project was coming.   O. K.... I just have a little painting to finish.     Are the walls staying up?  I inquired.   Oh, we accidently stepped on the coliseum, so  we made a hatchet.    Another time, my oldest son was to make a three  dimensional shadow box for English class, depicting  a book he had read.   Teachers must lie awake at  night dreaming up these deals.  Of course it was the night before due day when  he reluctantly began.  He drew a baseball diamond on paper and pasted  it in the bottom of an open shoe box.   He talked  about making eighteen pipe cleaner or toothpick  figures to represent the teams, but decided this  vjo i  lt;3l ew.ta. l too vnvicVi vroxU.    Vie started to dtavr  little dots on the inside walls of the box to portray  the crowd attending the game.   Upon completion of  about ten dots in a little cluster, he sighed loudly  and talked about making a stencil with a paper punch  to avoid the strain and effort of drawing individual  dots.   But this task was also ruled out.  After much thinking and little doing, bedtime  neared.  Suddenly,   he announced it was finished.  Surprised, I looked at the box, with its empty  playing field and the ten dots in the stands.   On the  outside of the display he had printed:   Baseball Stories  by Charles Coombs.  (This shadow box is two hours pre-game.)  D. Heidenreich   If it's two hours pre-game, why are some of the  fans there?  I asked.   That's a Den Mother with her Cub Scouts.   She  got mixed up on the time.   I took this personally, since, in those days, I was  a mixed up Den Mother myself.  But what really flipped me was the kid got a B  on the thing.

BOX 16306  INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA  46216  by  ARLINE   CHASE  Cambridge, MD  All my life I've wanted to be a writer.   Reading  mediocre books and articles, I told myself I could  do much better--if only I could find the time, of  course.   On my 40th birthday I decided that I must  begin my writing career soon for at least half my  life was over.   If I was going to start writing, I'd  better begin.   Now is the time,   I eagerly told my purplexed  husband.    I'll begin today    This minute   I said,  pushing last week's ironing back into the basket,  and beginning to search for pencil and paper.   That's fine with me.   I've never tried to chain  you to the old ironing board, but don't you think it  might be a good idea to learn how first?  he inquired,  raising one eyebrow and giving me that quizzical  look.  The more I thought about it, the more I knew he  was right, and I began to ask questions about writing  courses offered in my town.   I would be a writer, as  soon as I learned how   Signing up for Lila Line's course at Chesapeake  College,  Writing Articles for Publication,   I was  sure that my new career was well4aunched.   Joyfully  I attended the first class.   Happily I came home with  my assignment: write  a  How To  article.   Lila made it sound so easy,   I said.    Just think  of something you know how to do--and put it on  paper    All week I thought about all the things I know how  to do.   Painting?  No, my oils are all dried up.  Raising children?  No.   Mine are grown.   At least  they tell me so.   What to do?  What to do?   Surely  I'll be able to think of something.   Ah    I know...  I can knit--  There's that sweater that's done  almost to the armpits still in my bag since last fall.  But I'd have to finish the thing before I could take  any pictures, so maybe I'd better see how much was  needed to do before I got too far with this topic.  When I got the unfinished sweater out of the bag it  became apparent that the moths had been harder at  work than I, and my  100 Virgin Wool  was no longer  blemishless.   So much for knitting,   I said.   I told you not to begin that complicated nordic  design anyway,   my husband said.   Nevermind--I can write about sewing.   There  vras that suit 1 cut out but never got around to putting together.    It was going to be something special  I got my sewing kit down from the attic and sorted  through the pieces I'd cut so meticulously the fall-  before-last.   Was this the skirt?  Or part of the jacket?  I retrieved the folded and re-folded directions buried  at the bottom of the box, under the thread-that-no-  longer-matched, and the rusted bobbins. 'Simplicity   5094.   Toreador Pants and Sequin Embroidered  Jacket to match.'  if   Toreador Pants?   Nobody's worn them since 1956   Oh sure--I remember now, I modified the design to  modernize the pattern when I made the cut... But  how?  How?

I told you--You never finish anything, and you  won't complete that article either,   my husband  laughed, looking up from his newspaper.   Sure I will.... I'll write about cooking.   You  didn't weigh much more than 130 lbs. before we  were married--even you would have to admit I  can cook.   Look at your weight now.     Oh, you can cook, alright.   But I can't wait  until you try to write down some of your favorite  recipes.   How about Beef and Beer?  It's an unusual  dish, and you know I've always loved it.     Beef and Beer?  That's a great idea    It's so  simple to make, too    You just take some brisket--    How much brisket?    About  4.00 worth.     I hate to remind you dear, but the price of beef  fluctuates....   How much in pounds and ounces?    Oh   I never look at that--just the price.   You  get a good-sized piece of brisket for  4.00 when  beefs on sale.   About this big,   I said waving my  hands in the air to demonstrate.   But what about when it's not on sale?    Well, then you make sometEing else, silly   I begin to see what you mean--    You know you never measured anything in your  life,   he said laughing.  The whole idea of your  writing a how-to-cook article is s-s-so f-f-funny...     I suppose y ou  could do one?    Well, not cooking--But I could write about how  to play the guitar, or my woodworking, or the most  efficient way to split logs for a wood heater, or how  to train rabbit hounds, or the best way to build a  duck blind, or--    Nevermind    It's my assignment, not yours.  So spare me the rest of the list,   I said retreating to  the bedroom to write   Nc--I didn't write the 'how-to' article Lila  assigned.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  WOMEN'S RIGHTS DAY  IN CONGRESS  EQUAL RIGHTS  ECONOMIC RIGHTS  REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS  On Wednesday, February 4, 1981, 4000 women  (representing millions of women and men) from all  over the United States took part in Women's Rights  Day in Congress in Washington, DC.   The major  purpose of this day was to lobby individual Congress-  people on women's rights, in particular the Human  Life Amendment (HLA).  Twenty women from Indiana NOW, including 12  from Indianapolis, travelled to Washington to participate.  A number of well known feminists and Congress-  women spoke at an hour long rally.   Speakers included Gloria Steinem, Mary Tyler Moore, Ellie  Smeal, Congresswoman Pat Schroeder (D-CO),  Maggie Kuhn of the Gray Panthers, and many more.  Singer Kristen Lems performed several numbers.  Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm (D-NY) made a  particularly impressive speech.   She warned that the  present Congress is, at this time, quite receptive to  the concept of a Human Life Amendment.  In the afternoon women visited Congresspeople  and their aids.  Indiana women held interviews with Congressmen  Floyd Fithian and Andy Jacobs.   Both of these men  support some form of an HLA, but Fithian indicated  that he was unaware of certain ramifications of the  amendment, particularly those concerning birth  control.   He said he would do more research.   Jacobs  told the group that he wanted to see provisions included in the amendment for abortions in case of rape  or incest or in cases where the life of the mother is in  danger.   But, otherwise ....  Aides for Indiana Congressman Bud Hillis and  Senator Richard Lugar listened to the group and said  they would pass information on to the representatives,  indicating that neither was aware of all the ramifications of the HLA.   Due to some confusion in scheduling, Senator Dan Quayle could not be reached by the  Indianapolis group.  All of the above were given information packets.  Indiana women came away feeling that there is a lot  of work to be done as the Right to Life groups are putting tremendous pressures on Congress.   Mail that  Indiana Congresspeople has been receiving is running  strongly pro-HLA.  If you are worried (and all women and men should  be) about the HLA, write to your Congresspersons.  From the IndiaNOWpolis Woman, February, 1981.

Men : Welcome To Equality  by J. R. LAWRENCE  What is the best, most rational way for women to  achieve equality?  It's hard to say, but several weeks ago, two female Mormon  sisters  knocked at my door. They  were on their  missions,   and requested some of  my time.   After responding to several questions,  we began to discuss women and their place in the  Mormon religion.   I was especially interested in  their feelings regarding the excommunication of  Sonia Johnson for her support of the Equal Rights  Amendment.   Their response was that the Mormon  church was actually for equal rights, but took the  stand that the ERA was not the best way to achieve  equality for women.  Both women admitted they had never actually  read the amendment and of course neither of them  had realized that the Civil Rights Commission has  found over 800 federal statutes which discriminate  against women.  So what is the best way to achieve equality without the ERA?  Instead of beating our heads against brick walls  working from the ground up, perhaps the population  which is pro-equality should start working from the  top down.   Surely, the Mormon church wouldn't  mind true equality for men   For instance an article written by Paul Galloway suggests that every male in the U. S. have  his salary cut 40 percent.   This across the board  cut might apply to all men.  This decrease  might make the male income comparable with  the female salary in America.   Men:   Welcome  to equality   Of course dollars are only the beginning for male  equality.   I say let's void the male right to vote for  the next 144 years - - the length of time it took for  women to achieve suffrage since the country was  founded, and at the same time, we'll make the  next 40 presidents and vice-presidents of the United  States women.   While we're at it, men will have to  leave behind the notion that they will hold the  majority of seats in the House of Representatives  and the Senate (at both state and federal levels).  So much for politics.  On the home front, judges would award child  custody (in most cases) to the fathers.   Then,  daddies would have to be content with an occasional support check and a lot of lame excuses why regular child support is not forthcoming.   They  would also have to contend with the poor daycare  situation and/or babysitters who don't show up or  cancel five minutes before they were to arrive.  And how would they possibly cope with all those  mean, female bosses who call them in on the  carpet for staying home to care for a sick child?  Ideas regarding sex in the office would have to  change.   But perhaps some men would love a pat  on the fanny from their female bosses.  States, in order to even out past discriminatory  laws, would have to make some changes, too.  Take Louisiana, for example.   There, women would  be entitled to control stocks and bonds, even if they  had been issued in the names of their husbands.  So, Morman  sisters,   this article is dedicated to  you; and while I'm at it, let me state my personal  and sincere thanks to you and your church for setting my thinking straight.   How could I have ignored  such logic?  Indiana Women's Agenda for Action  An Indiana Women's Agenda for Action (WAA) was  formed at a Marion College Conference held in  Indiana in May 1980.  With the help of Sandra Frank, The Department of  Labor Women's Bureau Director for region V, the  group was formed to assure equal earnings, equal  employment,  and equal education for women.  Participants established goals and strategies around  five major issues:  1. Minority Women and Employment  2. Child Care/Working Mothers  3. Non-traditional Jobs for Women  4. Sex Discrimination  5. Older Women and employment  WAA hopes to have established a Commission on  the Status of Women in Indiana.   Meetings to discuss  this and other important issues are open to all individuals and organizations who support the goals and  want to work together to improve the employment  status of viomen.

        <pagetext>10.  And    I  Thought  of    Woman  by  MAY HARDING  Hamden, CT  The bachelor leaned against the cushions of the  couch, light falling pleasantly upon his face. His  voice came out indulgent and casual.   My mother,   he said,  is an example of the misfortune which attends a woman who has devoted her  life to her children.   She has no friends, no interests  of her own.   I think that she is rather unhappy, except  when my brother and I, and especially his children,  come home.   A sense of polite regret filled his words.  And I thought of woman, wife and mother, whose  life is not her own, whose fault is unavoidable and  primary.   Food and dust, years of the incessantly small  detail of drudgery and kindness, the household pattern.  Years... and at the end of them, her children grown up,  her husband grown apart, she faces herself, a strange  soul, forsaken in her centering upon the family.  Abnegation of self; now, sudden and startling, self  again.   A woman who has pushed aside her self since  girlhood meets it timidly, that vivid self-aware spirit  of her youth.   Not service now, but what?  She must  relearn what was once effortlessly hers-that strong  awareness of her own needs.   With reluctance the heart  once given returns.   How difficult, yes, yes, how hard.  He had said,  I think that she is rather unhappy.    Author's note:   I wrote this 40 years ago - before  my marriage and three children.   I am nearing 65  and took its message to heart.   I returned to teaching college at 40, and when I read this nowadays to  my writing classes, I am pleased to get a strong response .

INDIANAPOLIS WOMEN'S CENTER  THE ONLY INDIANAPOLIS  CLINIC LICENSED BY INDIANA  STATE BOARD OF HEALTH  Pregnancy Testing  Termination To Ten Weeks  Counseling  5626 E 16 -  353-9371  Call toll free 1-800-382-9029  WOMANKIND  Legislative Sentinal  Led by Jill Chambers, lobbyist for the Indiana  National Organization for Women, a state bill that  would have eliminated a provision that specified  women must be appointed to various boards in  Indiana was defeated.  Those Boards of Trustees included: Ball State,  Indiana State, and Purdue University plus Indiana  Vocational Technical College and The State  Civil Defense Advisory Council.  A 1980 NOW study indicated that unequal  representation presently exists on those colleges  and university boards. At least two of the schools  have more women than men and the others have a  35 to 45  female enrollment. These boards have  one to two women as compared to six to nine men  on the boards.  The sponser of the bill Representative Doris  Dorbecker(R) would not accept NOW suggestions  that HB 1025 adopt sex-neutral language, ie.   boards should represent or be comprised of both  sexes.   The YWCA, the American Association of University Women, and other groups and/or organizations  testified against this bill.   It was defeated in  committee.  Those opposing the bill pointed out that extra  provisions must be made to include women on  boards and councils until such time that they have  equal representation.  Kristen Lems in Indiana  Kristen Lems, feminist singer/songwriter, will perform on Thursday, March 26, in an 8 p.m. concert  at the Ball State Student Center Ballroom, 2000 University Avenue in Muncie, Indiana.

Thrive   is author, poet,  singer, playwright Angelou's message to Black Americans, to women, to children, to people everywhere.  Speaking in celebration of Afro-American History  Month, Angelou's visit to Indianapolis was sponsored  by the Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library.  Angelou's training as a dancer and performer  enabled her to characterize various stances and walks,  the body language of the Black community.   Her  rich spiritual voice, a voice with timbre and tone,  sang bits and pieces of Black songs in addition to the  Black poetry she recited or read.   The audience at  the St. Peter Claver Cultural Center loved it all.   Black literature is so real it will not indulge the  distance of oceans or of time.   Our heritage survives  in our gestures, our stances, our walks.     My people have been unable to give me packets  of the non-everlasting earth or the money that moves  nations, but they gave me the heritage I have.   What  they paid for is impervious to time.   It ennobles me  as a Black, as a Black female, as a Black female  American, as a Black, female, American human  being.     One of Angelou's themes was love.  Love is one  of the facets of the diamond of Black literature.  There is lyricism with meat and muscle and bones  and sinew in Black American literature,   she said.  And then she read or recited from memory poems by  Georgia Johnson, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Nikki Giovanni, Mari Evans, Lucile Clifton, and of course her  own poems   all on the subject of love   all kinds of  love.   She dedicated her poem  Phenomenal Woman   to  The Survivors    All those who ennoble the human  spirit.   She also quoted Terrace (154 B.C.) and applied his  words to her own philosophy:  I am a human being,  nothing human can be alien to me.    Claiming all  acts of virtue, in its broadest terms, as her own, she  included Shakespeare, Chopin, Van Gogh, and a  dozen others as belonging to all.   She noted it was  important to be centered, to have roots, to be  proud of African art, music, etc.   Thus secure, you  can embrace the rest of the world's art and  virtue.    In answer to a question from the audience Angelou  said,  It hurts me to see a black TV character written  by a white man who is stoned on cocaine in Malibu.  .. and little black children see this character and  think,  That's Black    Questioned about the teaching of Black English in  schools, Angelou replied,  I am bilingual. I can  switch from standard English to Black English without  even thinking.   It is important for our children to  have a command of standard English so they can  succeed in the marketplace.    Angelou said,  Laughter is one of the healing  factors in life.   We must have laughter.    On aggression, she stated,  When the tulip bulb opens and the  flower comes up, that is aggression.   It is imperative  to know the difference between aggression and  hostility. Imperative.   She kept her audience in the palm of her heart for  over an hour, reciting some of her poetry, reading  from historic Black poets, singing, reminiscing,  talking.   She ended with a plea,  Keep me in your  prayers by name and have faith,   and reminded  people to  Do more than survive--thrive    Thrive  with passion, some compassion, some humor and  some style    Angelou's books include, I KNOW WHY the CAGED  BIRD SINGS, GATHER TOGETHER in MY NAME, and  SINGIN' and SWINGIN' and GETTING MERRY LIKE  CHRISTMAS.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  11  Research Manuscripts    The desire to promote further understanding of  the social psychological response to voluntary  sterilization has promoted the Association for  Voluntary Sterilization to sponsor a competition  based on survey research dealing with the topic of  voluntary sterilization.  Some suggested areas of inquiry include such  variables as self-identity, desired family size, the  process of decision-making for permanent birth  control, sexual attitudes and behavior, marital  adjustment and the changing roles of men and women.  Cash awards will consist of  1000 for first prize,   750 for second prize and  500 for third prize.  Manuscripts will be evaluated by a three-member  Awards Committee consisting of academicians in  the field of survey research who have no affiliation  with AVS.  Deadline for submission is November 15, 1981.  For more detailed information and regulations  governing manuscript format, contact Betty Lanting  Gonzales, Deputy Director of National Programs,  AVS. 708 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017.

All correspondence can be sent to:  THE BLATANT IMAGE  Box 56 Wolf Creek, OR  97497  by  LINDA  FOLEY  Moraga, CA  I saw her many times - walking slightly stooped,  her cracked hands firmly clasped behind her back.  Resolutely, she placed one old foot in front of the  other as if she had a place to go.  Standing behind my sheer curtains, I waited for  her to pass the house each day.   With her head bent  she walked stopping now and again to admire  a tulip or to pat the fuzzy head of a stray dog or cat  - lonely strays acknowledging each other.  We had moved into our first home, just a short while  before, and I was aflutter with decorating ideas.   I  remember thinking how nice a neighborhood this was.  How quaint, how quiet, how almost-European it was-  how totally different from our previous New York  neighborhood.    Then one day, while measuring the  windows for drapery material, I saw her . And I  watched her pass.   Her appearance see-sawing past  my window added another dimension to my suburban  life.  That was in the summer.   In the winter, she  walked slowly almost methodically up and down the  street as if in search of something.   She was always  alone,   she wore a large coat with her collar turned  up to protect her ears from the sharp wind.   Sometimes, she faltered slightly on a patch of ice.   In  the winter's desolation, her figure cut a stark  silhouette and sometimes I wished not to see her.  Her lone figure carried sorrow and she made me  fear for my future for I could feel the wind in her  bones.   I saw her following an old tattered pattern.  I wanted to rush out, to stop 'her, to force time to  remain suspended.  When I finally resolved to put my feelings into  action, she had moved on- -one foot in front of the  other, biding time . . . following an age-old tattered  pattern.

Keep it on   Sincerely,  Arline Chase  Cambridge, MD  Editors' Note:   See Arline Chase's article on page 8.  And her special letter below.  Perhaps your readers who are also writers, or who  support the concept of the printed word, would be  interested in the following information:  The IRS has interpreted the recent Supreme Court  Decision on Thor Power Tools, to apply to book  publishers as well.   This means that ALL inventory is  taxable, and publishers can no longer depreciate  taxes on standing inventories.  Because of this ruling, publishers are selling back  issues to remainder houses, and in some cases to  pulp operations, much faster than they ordinarily  would.   Many valuable books, along with their  ideas, information, and concepts have already been  destroyed.  To writers, the decision means that fewer books  will see print, and those that do, will go out-of-  print much faster.   Senator Moynihan will shortly  introduce legislation to exempt publishers from the  Thor Power Tool ruling.   Other legislators, not yet  named, will support him in his efforts.  As writers, as women, as defenders of the right of  all citizens to information, it is imperative that we  contact our Senators and Representatives in Washington,  and urge that they support this legislation.  Sincerely,  Arline Chase  I am a fashion-editor of a local St. Louis newspaper and 'roving-reporter' for a South African  newspaper.  I would be keen to receive more information on WOMANKIND in addition to guidelines  for manuscripts you publish.  Thank you.  Sincerely,  Alana Dishy  St. Louis, MO.  Please send information on WOMANKIND a bi  monthly literary/news publication to:  Mrs. Nancy Rutkoski  The United Way Bldg.  Erie, PA  I recently heard of your publication, and would like  to request subscription information and writers' guidelines.   If you can manage to send a sample copy for  review, I can circulate it in the women's community  here.   Be encouraged in your work and keep strong.  In Sisterhood,  Mary Ann Campbell,  St. Louis, MO  Sorry this is so late.   I misplaced your address, and  just found it yesterday.  The posters are beautiful   Margaret Waite  Ft. Wayne, IN  Editor's note:  Large 17 1/2  X 23 1/2  posters have  been made of the WOMANKIND cover of Issue  12  (the mountain collage of women with calligraphy by  Jill Chambers).

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  ERA NOW or Maybe Never  The Equal Rights Amendment is needed more  today than when it was first introduced in 1923  and passed hy Congress in 1972. Current  conservative policymakers are seeking to repeal  the few existing guarantees for women. Under  federal  deregulation  schemes, the conservatives  are proposing the repeal of equal credit and  affirmative action regulations, the removal of  enforcement procedures for equal employment  laws and under block grant distribution plans,  the dilution of equal education laws.  The ERA is necessary in order to establish a  national policy and to set a standard for the  elimination of discrimination based on sex.  What is at stake is economic independence for  women     whether women will continue to be  paid only half of what men are paid and whether  women will be forever relegated to the  dependence which low wages and low status  impose.  What is at stake is Constitutional equality for  women in this century. One law at a time is the  slow road to equality and would take another  250 years at the present rate of development.  Co-ed does not mean co-equal   It has been our experience and the experience of  Girls Club of America, Inc. (GCA) and girls school  alumnae that an ail-girl environment is crucial to  developing the confidence and self-esteem needed to  be successful and productive women,  says Dr. Edith  B. Phelps.   Dr. Phelps is the National Executive  Director of Girls Clubs of America (GCA), a not-  for-profit service and advocacy agency that serves  nearly a quarter of a million girls age 6 to 18 in Girls  Clubs across the country.   Until co-ed means co-equal, Girls Clubs of  America will devote priority attention to funding and  programs for girls,   says Dr. Phelps.  Although co-ed programs are usually regarded as the  answer to providing needed services to girls, GCA's  booklet points out that boys' programs which become  co-ed often offer unequal opportunities to girls.   In  fact, nationally, girls and girls' programs are not getting  a fair share of funding dollars or of staff time.  The deadline for ratification of the ERA is June  30, 1982. Join the ERA Countdown Campaign.  WOMEN in the COMMUNITY sites chosen  Funded by a  250, 000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, seven community teams have  been selected to participate in Radcliffe College's  WOMEN IN THE COMMUNITY project.   The communities  are Ellensburg, Wash.; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Milwaukee  Wise.; Champaign, HI.; Rocky Hill, N.J. ; Atlanta, Ga.;  and Memphis, Tenn.  Four-member teams, which include a women's studies  scholar, a member of a community organization, an  academic librarian, and a public librarian, are preparing  programs about women to be offered in their local public  libraries.   The programs will focus on the project theme,   Women in the Community:   Where Were They?  Where  Are They?   Where Are They Going? .   Community teams  will use local library and human resources for planning, and  will offer programs that are responsive to the needs of their  local communities.

Established at Radcliffe College  in 1943, the library, now under the direction of Patricia  Miller King, collects materials on women's roles and  contributions to American life from 1800 to the present.  It is the largest, best-known, and most comprehensive  research library on women in the country, and sponsors  programs on topics related to its own holdings and to  recent research on women's lives.  After the training session, the teams will return to  their communities to plan and implement a series of  programs to take place between February and July,  1982.   A coordinator from Radcliffe will be working  with the teams throughout the planning and implementation periods.  Director of the project is Barbara Haber, curator of  printed books at the Schlesinger Library and author of  Women in America: A Guide to Books , published by  the University 6f Illinois Press.   t  .)C  ihl3mWi staff  EDITOR  Judith LaFourest  STAFF  CONTRIBUTORS  Charlene Baldridge      Joyce B.

Homemakers  wear yellow ribbons  Homemakers across the nation will wear yellow  ribbons this year to protest the hostage-like position  of American women.  The Homemakers' Equal Rights Association (HERA),  a national organization working to improve the legal  and social status of homemakers, has declared the  yellow ribbon, which dates back to the early women's  suffrage movement, as their symbol, adding it to  their traditional pink rose, representing womanhood  and femininity.   American women are hostage to antiquated laws  which treat them in a category with children and the  insane,  according to Terri Wedoff, HERA president.   Yet as homemakers we are trusted with the most  important job in the land, the nurturing of families,    she added.  HERA has chosen the yellow ribbon as a theme based  on an original poem written by suffragist Marie le Baron  in 1876 to protest the Centennial of the Declaration of  Independence in Philadelphia.   Le Baron called yellow   God's own primal color, born of purity and light.   She declared that  women wear it now for Liberty,  for Justice and for Right.    Her poem commemorated  women's role in both the War for Independence and  the war against slavery, but then noted that  still  women struggle for our Liberty, our Right.    She  was referring to the right to vote.   It took women until 1920 to win the right to vote.  And now we are working on a broader issue, a constitutional amendment that will guarantee women all  the same rights that men have no matter where they  live in this great country of ours,   Wedoff stated.   We're talking about the right to sign contracts, to  own and manage property, to execute wills, to inherit  property and to serve on juries,   she noted.    Why  in most states, even our right to vote depends on our  husband's being a resident of that state:   if a man's  company transfers him but his wife stays behind to  sell the house, she effectively loses her right to vote,    Wedoff said.  Since a constitutional guarantee of equal legal  treatment is critical to homemakers, HERA has declared June 30, 1981 to June 30, 1982 as a  Countdown  to Equality .    We will put forth an all out effort for  the Equal Rights Amendment before the deadline for  ratification in 1982, homemakers will not be held  hostage to injustice,   she declared.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  When I arrived at the Country Club of Indianapolis to  cover the Mayflower Classic, I was surprised by the friendliness and cordiality among the officials, the press, and  the players. Since this was my first really professional  sports coverage, I had many questions . I asked and was  given maps, fact sheets, information, assistance, and  answers. Several persons were eager to help me. I was  pleased and ready to begin covering the 1981 Ladies Professional Golf Association's Indianapolis tournament.  After I pinned on my media button and strapped a red  armband with the word  official  on it around my leg  (it was too big for my arm), I flung my camera bag  and camera over my shoulders and took off.   Up till  then, taking photographs and reporting local sports  events for a community paper had been mostly a cush  job.   Now dashing around a 6,100-yard golf course  trying to get some shots of those golfers of whom I  wanted pictures was no easy task.   With over 10 pounds  of camera gear, an armload of various pamphlets,  articles, scores, player biographies, and temperatures  in the 90's with high humidity, it was a demanding  assignment, but also a special opportunity. I'd do it  all again on a moment's notice.  When I first met up with Debbie Austin on the 9th  hole of the first round, I was captivated by her warm  personality and smile which I couldn't help but return.  That perpetual smile and her fantastic playing went  with her from hole to hole, day to day, my camera and  I in close pursuit.  Thursday, July 9, was the first day of competition for the   22, 500 first place prize.   Austin shot a 68, four under par.  Having had trouble with her putting this year, she placed  a phone call to Rena Ritson, one of her instructors, Tuesday night before Wednesday's Pro Am.  The advice worked as she hit several astonishing shots,  like sinking a 40-foot wedge shot on No. 10, and a 35-  foot putt on No. 15.   On No. 16, her ball hit an old  sprinkler head just in front of the green and leapt 30 yards  beyond the flag.    That wouldn't have been so aggravating if I had hit a bad shot,  said Austin.    But I felt I  had been sort of robbed.   During the day, I went over to the 9th hole to get a  few shots of last year's winner Amy Alcott.   As I was '  adjusting my camera, fiddling with all the knobs and dials,  a man came from behind and asked me,  How does Amy  stand?   Interrupted from trying to get the proper adjustments in time to catch a good shot of Alcott, I said a  word or two under my breath, then I asked him,    What?I   He repeated his question.   I still had camera adjustments  on my mind,   not how Alcott  was standing,   so I  looked up to see her.   The question didn't make much sense  at the time, and I couldn't have cared less about how she  was standing, so I gave him the only logical answer I  could think of --  On two feet?   He snorted and walked  away to leave me to my work. Only then did I realize  that he had wanted Alcott's golf statistics....  During the fourth round, Austin's brother, Peter,  approached me and asked me to take a couple of pictures  for him, including one of the leader board, then showing  his sister twelve under.  Austin managed to hold on to a 4-stroke lead for a final  total of 279, nine under par for the 72-hole tournament.  Hollis Stacy and Myra VanHoose tied for second with 283.  Amy Alcott and Louise Bruce Parks tied for fourth, followed  by Sally Little in sixth.  Indianapolis' Kyle O'Brian, a North Central High School  graduate, placed seventh with a one under par 287,  byE.K. BRAMBLETT  Indianapolis, IN  Later, out by the pool, at the Worker's Party, I talked  to members, officials, and workers who had spent the  tournament as gophers, ball-chasers, and the like.   Within  a short time, Austin strode out to the pool area, followed  by John Smith, president of the LPGA. After making  her way through the crowd, Austin took a neat dive into the water. Right behind her flew Smith -- hat,  glasses, shoes, and all  Austin swam to the shallow end and picked up Little  Miss Mayflower Vicki Hunt.   Vicki, of Riley Children's  Hospital, was  a great inspiration  to Austin during the  tournament.   It's really a dream come true.. .I've worked a  a long time for this,  says Debbie Austin, Mayflower 1981 Champion. (Photo by E.K.Bramblett)  Debbie Austin was born on February 1, 1948 in Oneida,  N.Y. and currently lives in Haines City, FL.   She was the  youngest ever to compete in the New York Amateur at 16,  and won the state high school championship by 10 shots.  She won several college titles at Miami-Dade Country Club,  and was a Rollins College medalist in the North-South  Amateur.  She turned professional in May of 1968.   Her first victory came in 1977, when she won five events, three of  them in four consecutive weeks.   Since, she has been  bothered by tendonitis in her left shoulder and an ankle  injury   and had major surgery last Christmas.  Austin is 5'4 , her blonde hair and brown eyes accent  a perpetual smile.   At one time, she had considered quitting golf, and attended a travel agent school.   Fortunately,  friends and relatives talked her out of it.  There is a dictionary definition for  champion,   but  until one has had the opportunity to see Debbie Austin at  work on the golf course, dealing with people, and has the  opportunity to speak with her, one probably has not known  the true meaning of the word.  On the final hole, an ecstatic Debbie Austin side-  arms her ball into a gallery of eager, waving  hands.

In 1981, the LPGA will play for a record  5. 8  million in prize monies in a record 40 tournaments  to be played in the U. S., Canada, and Japan.   In  1975, prize monies were  1.4 million.   The increase  between '75 and '81 is 420 .  The average purse in 1981 will approximate   140, 000,   The average purse in 1975 was under   50, 000.  In 1980, ten players surpassed the  100, 000 mark.  Four players broke the  200, 000 mark,   Beth Daniel  was the first to crest the  200, 000 mark in early  September at the UNITED VIRGINIA BANK GOLF  CLASSIC.   Nine of the Top 10 money winners had  Austin hugs caddy; caddy hugs Austin... after  that final putt on the 18th. (Photo by Carol  Siegmann)  their best season ever in 1980, 17 of the Top 25 had  their best.  The number of tournament dates has increased from  28 in 1975 to 40 in 1981.  The number of  100, 000 events in 1975 was two;  in 1981, there will be 34 tournaments  125, 000  and over.  The number of LPGA television dates in 1975  was two; in 1981 there will be a minimum of 12  telecasts.   More-people saw the LPGA in  1979/1980 than in its entire previous history as  a result of network TV being attracted to the  women's professional golf tour.  There are two LPGA Qualifying Schools a year- -  winter and summer.   Women, 18 years of age and  older are eligible to apply.   They must have USGA  handicaps of three or better, two or more letters  of recommendation from qualified golf professionals sis to the applicant's playing ability,  application and processing fee.  ERA Report  The U.S. Commission on Civil  Rights has just issued a 29-page  report, The Equal Rights Amendment: Guaranteeing Equal Rights for  Women Under the Constitution, to  emphasize just how essential the  ERA is to achieving equality.  The report reviews developments in  family law and provides a new  analysis of how the ERA will affect  women's pensions, insurance and  social security. The report also notes  that laws granting different rights,  privileges and protections to wives  and husbands would be invalidated by  ERA.  According to the report, the only  power that States will lose is  the  power to discriminate against individuals on the basis of sex.   For more information and copies of  the report, contact Barbara J.  Brooks, U.S. Commission on Civil  Rights, 1121 Vermont Avenue, N.W.,  Washington, D.C. 20425. (202)  254-6697.  Spokeswoman        July 1981  Comparable worth rule  On June 8, 1981, the Supreme Court ruled that  according to the principle of  Comparable worth   women no longer have to PROVE that they are doing EXACTLY the same job as men in order to  file pay descrimination charges.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Report on Toxic Shock Syndrome  A NEW DISEASE?  In 1980, the public learned about Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS),  a rare but serious disease which mainly  strikes menstruating women under 30 who are using tampons. Although only a small number of menstruating  women have gotten TSS, some of them have died.  This disease is a syndrome or group of symptoms. At  present, only those people who have all the symptoms  listed are officially counted as having TSS. However,  there are reports of people with a few of the symptoms  who may have a milder form of the same disease. The  symptoms are:  * A high fever, usually over 104  * Vomiting  * Diarrhea  *A sudden drop in blood pressure which may lead to  shock  * A sunburn-like rash which peels after a while, the  rashes are easiest to see on a person's trunk and neck,  but peeling is the most obvious on the palms of the  hand or the soles of the feet  CAUSE  Little is actually known about TSS and information is  changing rapidly.   It is probably caused bv a new strain  of the bacterium Staphlococcus aureus (S. aureus). The  bacterium infects some part of the body, often the vagina,  and produces toxins (poisons) which go into the bloodstream.  The body reacts to these t oxins with the various symptoms  that have come to be called TSS.  Tampon applicators or the dry tampons may cause small  scratches and scrapes in the vaginal wall. Researchers differ  on whether it is these scrapes which allow the toxin to get  into the bloodstream. Recent tests show that the tampons  themselves are not contaminated with S. aureus. Also, no  one knows if the type of birth control used or if the pH  (acidity or alkalinity) of a woman's vaginal secretions  significantly affect the growth of S. aureus.  SYMPTOMS  IF YOU GET ANY OF THE SYMPTOMS LISTED DURING YOUR PERIOD  AND YOU ARE USING A TAMPON,  REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY. Do not use tampons or  any other  internal method  for catching menstrual blood  until you get a culture showing that you do not have any  S. aureus in your vagina. It's a good idea to get in touch  right away with a medical person who can keep track of  what is happening to you. For a mild case, the most im  portant thing is to drink lots of fluids and get as much  rest as possible.  TSS involving severe dehydration or very low blood  pressure may require hospitalization with medical  treatment for these life-threatening symptoms. Although  anti-biotics do not seem to affect the symptoms once  the disease has started, they can still significantly  reduce the chance of recurrence. Since this type of S.  aureus is penicillin and ampicillin resistant, betalacta-  mate must be used.  PREVENTING TSS  You can reduce your risk of getting TSS by not using  any internal menstrual product. You can reduce the risk  with tampons by using them on and off during menstruation. This means, for example, alternating tampons  with sanitary napkins or using nothing during times of  very light flow, especially at night. Also, with tampons  you may reduce the risk of TSS by avoiding superabsor-  bant ones. Although some groups recommend changing  tampons frequently, there is no evidence that this reduces  the chance of getting TSS.  Some women have chosen to use SEA SPONGES or  DIAPHRAGMS to collect menstrual fluid.   NO ONE  KNOWS IF THE RISK OF TSS WITH THESE ALTERNATE  METHODS IS ANY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WITH TAMPONS.   There have been at least two cases of TSS associated with sponges.  WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE  More investigation must be done to allow us to understand the problem of TSS better. Studies have been few,  and sometimes not well done.  Believe it or not, tampons have never been subjected  to government or to independent studies for safety and  efficacy.   Tampon manufacturers have refused to reveal  what tampons are actually made of.   Encourage the government to require the tampon manufacturers to put content labeling on tampon (and napkin) boxes, as well as  putting a warning about TSS by writing Dr. Lillian Yin,  Director, Division of Ob-Gyn and Radiology Devices,  8757 Georgia Ave.,   Silver Spring, MD 20910.  More research needs to be done on the safety of sponges  for menstruation.   There are mixed reports on whether  sponges are contaminated by pollutants while growing in  the ocean and how serious a problem this is.   Currently,  women's clinics have diverse opinions on whether to recommend sponges.   Women are researching the safety  of sea sponges and hope to know more soon.  The Food and Drug Administration is harassing the  sponge distributors, usually one-woman businesses, to  get them to stop selling sponges, while moving slowly  in requiring stricter standards for tampons.  TSS has raised many questions about consumer protection, manufacturer liability, and our right to know exactly what is contained in all the foods and products we  put into our bodies.   We need to make corporations and  those who fund research accountable to the public and  especially to women.  STATISTICS     Proportion of women who get TSS: 6-15 per 100, 000  menstruating women per year.     Total number of cases reported in 1980: 45 (all women).     Percentage of cases unrelated to menstruation: 3 percent  of reported cases.     Actual number of non-menstrual cases in 1980: 25.     Chance of recurrence if no antibiotic treatment is given:  30 percent.  Sandra D. O'Connor Named  To U.S. Supreme Court  On July 7 President Reagan  nominated Judge Sandra D. O'Connor of the Arizona Court of Appeals to  the U.S. Supreme Court. She is the  first female ever nominated to that  position.  She was backed by both U.S.  Senators from Arizona, Barry  Goldwater (R) and Dennis DeConcini  (D), who is on the Judiciary Committee. She reportedly finished third in  the Stanford law class in which  Justice William H. Rehnquist was  first, and she co-chaired Arizona's  committee to reelect Nixon in 1972.  She has been active in Republican  Party politics for almost 20 years.  She was assistant attorney general  in Arizona from 1965 to 1969, a  member of the Arizona Senate from  Diablo Canyon Feminists  SANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA  JULY 30, 1981  It's been a long time coming, but the Diablo  Canyon nuclear power plant is on the brink of being  licensed for operation.   Located 2 1/2 miles from  the Hosgri earthquake fault near San Luis Obispo,  California, the  plant has been contested by anti-  nuclear activists for close to a decade.   The long  process of legal intervention against the plant was  begun by Mothers for Peace of San Luis Obispo  in the early 70's.  The U.S. Geological Survey announced in 1973  that the Hosgri fault is capable of an earthquake  8 to 10 times greater than the twin reactor plant  could withstand.   Despite such evidence, the Atomic  Safety Licensing Board (ASLB) recently ruled that  Diablo is earthquake safe.  A blockade of the Diablo plant has been in the  works amongst anti-nuclear groups --the Abalone  Alliance and others -- since 1978.    During the  past year, as the blockade has come steadily nearer,  Women Opposed to Nuclear Technology - - a Santa  Cruz based feminist group -- has been alerting like-  minded feminists nationwide.  The Feminist Cluster is a focused core of affinity  groups prepared to occupy Diablo Canyon.   As well  as creating a strong feminist presence at the blockade,  the Feminist Cluster wants to provide a supportive  atmosphere for women involved in this very volatile  situation  The Cluster is open to other feminists interested  in the blockade .   Besides actually putting your body  on the line, there are other ways to support the action,  from taking care of a blockader'3 pet to being a media  contact.   The Cluster is also in need of feminist legal  support, camping equipment, and, of course, money.  If you are interested in supporting this action,  contact WONT at P.O. Box 1065, Santa Cruz, CA  95061, (408)425-5211 (answering service).

She was urged to  run for Governor but preferred to pursue her judicial career.  Reagan's choice of a woman fulfilled a campaign promise he made  last fall. He said he did not name a  woman  merely to do so,  but  because she met the standards he set  for the position. He urged the  Senate's swift confirmation of her  nomination so that  as soon as possible she may take her seat on the  Court and her place in history.   Right-wing conservatives are opposing her nomination because she  supported the Equal Rights Amendment and has not opposed abortion.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Fair booth sign offends women  by SHERITA SUE CAMPBELL  Muncie,  Indiana   I saw this sign at the shooting gallery.    Sue Wilson was at the Madison County, Indiana  4H fair in Alexandria.  The sign had a painted stereotypical sheriff  with a machine gun, and the words painted on the  sign said:  No, you can't bring your wife in here  to shoot, but you can bring her picture.  Wilson  was appalled.   She alerted the Muncie NOW  membership.  The next night, Wilson pushed her mother  through the midway in her wheelchair.   Accompanying them were:   Sue Errington,  Indiana State  Legislative Coordinator, NOW; Ruth Peters, President of Muncie-Delaware County NOW; Ruth  Reichard,  Vice-President, and Sexual Harrassment  Task Force Coordinator.   They had cameras and  hoped to get a picture.  They tried to persuade Kenneth Hess, owner  of the booth, that the sign contributed to violence against women.   Women like that sign,   he said.    They  bring their husbands, and everybody has a good  laugh and a good time.    Having failed to convince Hess, the delegation proceeded to the booking agent and supervisor of concessions, Drago Amusements, which,  of course, saw the sign in the same  good humor   as Hess.   Everyone who works in this carnival is pro-family.  No one here wants violence against women and we  don't believe this sign says so,   said Hess.  Sue Errington explained the women's opposition  to the sign then took the group to the Kiwanis tent,  as they had sponsored the 4H fair, she explained.  They lodged a protest to see if the Kiwanis as   pro-family  would intercede.  The local Kiwanis Vice-President and Secretary  were there and went with Sue and the NOW delegation to view the sign.  They said,  We'll bring the rest of the membership and our wives and view the sign and we will  hold a meeting and issue a policy statement.    Meanwhile, NOW Muncie President, Ruth Peters  issued a policy statement of her own in the form of  a letter of complaint stating that  to wink at violence against women is condoning it.   This is a  family fairgrounds.   When children and some men  see this - - they are going to think violence against  women is o.k.   The Kiwanis statement came out.     Their wives  had viewed the sign and thought it was not bad.    There were some words about how the Kiwanis was  for equality among the sexes in sports and supported  games for both boys and girls and camps for boys  The next day former Muncie-Delaware County  NOW President Charlotte Creech, and Anne Wheeler,  Jill McClintock and Mary Anne Stier visited the booth  to see if the sign was down, to see if it was possible  to get a picture, and if the sign was still up to get  someone to remove it.  The confrontation occurred.   No, you can't take a picture.    Hess and several  of his people stood in front of the sign    He maintained to Creech that his constitutional rights were  violated by taking the picture, by anyone trying to  tell him what to write on his sign, and by trying to  have the sign taken down.   You people are the trouble makers, not this sign,    said a carny worker.   I wouldn't want my dog's picture up there,    Wheeler said.   NOW stressed that violence against  women wasn't the only issue, violence against anyone  was bad and a picture of any person being used for target  practice contributed to that.   I've traveled with that sign for ten years, and no one  has complained,   he said shaking his head.    What do  these radical women want?    All you need are hippy beads,   said a fair worker to  Creech as she left after calmly explaining that NOW  people volunteered hours of service to domestic violence  shelters and worked tirelessly to end this horror and had  supported the Domestic Violence Shelter Legislation  to fund more shelters.  The group returned home and interested the ANDERSON HERALD in the story.   The paper sent staff writer,  Tom Carey,  to do a story,  and photographer, Curt  Wills, to take a picture.  The photographer required a police escort to take  the picture that ran alongside the story on July 23.  NOW members monitored the fairground all week  but it was apparent that they weren't welcome.  The booth closed, but the sign remained  The fair is gone now, with Hess and his sign  urging American husbands to shoot their wives'  pictures.   Hess says he will not return to that area  again.  If that booth or a similar one comes to your area  - - what will you do?  TIMELESS STITCHES    *E2  ?  r*  Myrna Shiras'   Stitched Drawings  QUIET IS SOUND, stiched drawing on handmade paper,  by myself conversations     secrets    kept secret  (Photo compliments of artist)  It hasn't been easy for California artist Myrna  Shiras.   Her stitched drawings and paintings reveal  the struggle of emotions, deep commitment,  intense, almost painful awareness.   It is evocative  work that makes use of handmade papers, threads,  words and an occasional pigment.    The whole argument between fine arts and  crafts is whether crafts carry content,'' Shiras  says.    I wanted to prove they can.    Shiras began working in the medium of stitched  paintings in 1971 because she was caught up in  the women's movement and felt her oil paintings  had been built on a male tradition, not really  her own.   She began painting on paper that she  embroidered.    I'd change a color,   Shiras  says,  by painting a piece of paper, cutting it  out, attaching it to another piece, and appli-  queing the edges.   When the work became internalized, automatic, I began to see that the  stitch medium is meditative.   The   work is slow,  repetitive, comforting, a process that helps develop a fuller, richer inner life.   Because it  goes so slowly, a stitched line compresses time  and emotional energy.   So the consciously chosen techniques became  an expressive medium and the method became  important as validation of women's work in crafts,  a link to the history of woman making art, the  art of our grandmothers.   Shiras believes her  stitched paintings to be feminist, visual commentary.  From a longer article first  MAGAZINE, May/June  For Shiras, the paper is the partner of the drawing. She selects handmade papers carefully. And  she works with that paper, adapts to it, grows with  it in collaboration. Her work reflects the struggle  of the journey between the inner and outer self,  even her voice during the interview softens to a  near-whisper, as her thoughts fly inward.  Many of the three-dimensional pieces convey the  idea of envelopes or boxes to imply that things are  hidden, significant things, perhaps letters or souvenirs  from a romance.   Layers of paper generate levels of  meaning.  The emotional weight of the pieces does convince  viewers something is hidden inside them.   Nothing  is.   But gallery-goers have said,  You do have papers  in the journals, don't you?  Or,  I'd love to reach  inside and see what's there.      They think,   Shiras  insists,    there must be papers hidden inside, just  as we assume a gravestone covers something in the  ground.    One viewer said this work gave her a feeling of  profound melancholy, yet she felt upbeat that they  were done, because no one who really felt this sad  could have done them.    Shiras smiles.    The point is that the viewers  were talking about the content of the work.   The  medium could carry ideas just as powerfully as paint,  just as powerfully as the drawn line.   The realization  wowed me.   published in FIBERARTS  1981, Ashville, NC.  Our Bodies Ourselves  DEAR WOMANKIND READERS,  We have just begun a major revision of OUR BODIES,  OURSELVES.   We need your help to make it speak to and  and for as many women as possible.  In addition to sections on reproductive issues, taking  care of ourselves, sexuality and relationships, violence  against women, and health and medical care, we plan  to add sections about women in the workplace, environmental hazards, reproductive technology, alternative forms of health care, and growing older.   We  will be making stronger distinctions between health care  and medical care.   Throughout the book we want to  include more experiences from women of color, women  with disabilities, midlife and older women.  Your written contributions will help shape our  understanding of what needs to be in the book.   Please  send us experiences in any of the above areas that  have affected you deeply, changed you, helped you,  angered you.   What have you learned that could help  other women?  Perhaps you would prefer to send a poem  or journal entry.  We will read all the material you send us, quoting  from some, not all,  in the revised OUR BODIES,  OURSELVES.   We will not use your real name in print  except in the case of poetry, if you wish.   All material  you send becomes our property and will not be returned.   We will, however, unless you indicate otherwise, keep your contributions on file in our office for  other women to read and learn from.  When you write, take enough time and space to do  justice to what you have to say, but be brief where  possible.   We won't be able to respond personally,  but please know in advance how much we appreciate  your help, caring, and time.  In sisterhood,  Boston Women's  Health Book  Collective, Inc.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Sexual harassment kit ready  The Federation of Organizations for Professional  Women (FOPW) has published a Sexual Harassment  Action Kit.   The Kit has been developed in response  to requests from professional organizations for guidance  on how to deal with questions regarding sexual harassment.  The Action Kit provides the legal definition of sexual harassment.   The Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission guidelines are discussed in terms of the  employer's responsibility, and the results of recent  studies and court cases are summarized.   Steps which  employers can take to prevent sexual harassment are  presented, as well as an action checklist for employees  who have experienced harassment.    Also included are  legal options for victims and special considerations for  academics.   A list of selected resources and publications  identifies organizations with specific sexual harassment  information.  Since the EEOC ruling that sexual harassment is a  form of sexual discrimination that is prohibited by  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the issue  has gained prominence and is being addressed by employers in many settings and fields.   Sexual harassment  is illegal and employers now have a legal obligation  To communicate that it will not be tolerated in the  workplace.   Some professional societies such as the   merican Psychological Association, have specifically  identified sexual harassment as unethical conduct.  To order copies of the Kit, send a self-addressed  mailing label and  2. 50 for each copy to FOPW ,  2000   P   Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.  Checks should be made payable to  FOPW .  Ethnic American Women  A conference on ethnic American women took place  at the University of Southern California on May 1, 2  and 3, 1981.   Sponsored by the Study of Women and  Men in Society andEthnic Studies,  the conference was  the first comparative, cross-cultural approach in the  wake of several important conferences focusing on  women of one ethnicity.     This conference explored  the most significant scholarship of American Indian,  Asian/Pacific, Black and Hispanic women in the  United States.   Also examined was the role of Ethnic  Americans in the future of higher education.   A major  outcome of this conference was the recommendation  for the formation of a National Organization for  Ethnic American Women in Higher Education.  ERA missionaries  With less than a year remaining before the ERA deadline, The National Organization for Women has intensified its push for ratifying three more states. Indiana  NOW Legislative Coordinator, Sue Errington of Muncie,  Indiana spent more than a month canvassing Salt Lake  City and other parts of Utah as a part of this effort.  Errington returned June 15 with some very interesting  information about ERA support in the heart of Mormon  Utah.  Indiana NOW members Jessica Hirsch from Bloomington and Charlotte Creech from Muncie have also  volunteered as ERA missionaries to Utah and have firsthand stories to share.  Creech and Errington are available for speaking engagements. If interested, contact Muncie NO W   P.O  Box 1246, Muncie, IN 47305  Att: Charlotte Creech  or call 1-317-289-1239.  Donations to cover expenses would be needed.  In November, Creech and/or Errington will be at  The WOMANKIND CENTER . Their subject Startling  Revelations from Utah.

Cindy Marano, Project Director of Wider Opportunities  for Women Inc. (WOW), a non-profit corporation which  monitors government policies and provides employment  advocacy for women was in Indianapolis on June 4, 1981.  She addressed a legislative conference of the WOMEN'S  AGENDA for ACTION,  In her talk, Marano pointed out that an August 1980  report revealed that women are the nation's poor.   The  study also noted that if social policies do not cha nge  almost I00?o of the poor will be female heads of households and their children by the year 2000.   The President's economic recovery plan is going to  have drastic effects on the Comprehensive Employment  Training Act (CETA) concerning women,   Marano said.  Many community-based women's programs such as rape  crisis and battered women's programs have already been  affected.  Speaking about Affirmative Action and what is taking  place in Washington, D.C, now, Marano said:    that  the regulations are currently being re-written and the  re-write being done contains a number of items which  she believes women need to know about.     For example,  the kind of construction companies that will come under  these affirmative action guidelines are being changed and  limits on the KINDS of companies in terms of size, number  of employees, and the dollar value of the contract are all  being altered.   The remedies for persons who are discrimi-;  nated against are also being altered.   The Office of Federal  Contract Compliance (OFCCP) is reviewing the question of  back pay.   If a person suffers discrimination, a traditional remedy  has been that the person was eligible for back pay settlement.   Now, back pay is not being considered as a possible  remedy,   said Marano.  Congressman Pete McClausky, from California has  drafted a new bill which is being seriously considered  by the White House. This bill would make it impossible to bring class action efforts in affirmative action  and  would place an enormous burden individual,    she said.  Another proposal being considered is the Hatch Amendment which is against affirmative action.  It is in the  Senate and if it is passed it will become a National A-  mendment of the Constitution -- against affirmative  action,   Marano said.   Thisis not only a question of sex. It is a  question of  sex,  age, race, handicapped and national orgin.  All  of these affirmative action regulations in these areas  are under attack.  We need to be prepared and organized to work to maintain them    Another part of the Presidents's economic recovery plan are the cutbacks to Aid to Families  with Dependent Children (AFDC).   In addition  to the AFDC cutbacks is the plan to extablish a  mandatory work fair program.   Persons receiving  AFDC would be required to register for work up  to 29 hours a week to pay back money received  through AFDC.    Essentially NO support services  are attached to this plan.   No funds for transportation or child care are included but a person  must work in order to receive her check,   said  Marano.    Under the State block grant processing, the education block grant bill is doing  quite well in Congress.   This means that such  things as vocational education and its sex equity  provisions, the Women's Educational Equity Act  and most programs that are set up for the children,  and disabled women educationally are going to be  cut back drastically     We do not know what will  happen with block grants and it is mind boggling  to try to imagine how to implement them quickly.  age upon which people can retire is a significant  issue for women    It is of extreme importance for  displaced home-makers where there may be a long  period of time before a woman is eligible for her  husband's Social Security benefits.  There is some good news for women that Marano  brought with her.   The Women's Economic Equity  package, introduced by the Women's Caucus in the  House, chaired by Pat Schroeder (R) and Margaret  Heckler (R) and with major senate sponsors Dorrin-  burger (R), Packwood (R), and Hatfield (R), looks  at social security pension reform and targets jobs'  tax credit, insurance and a number of other economic  issues concerning women.    This is the ONLY economic assistance bill facing the Congress at the moment that does have a chance of passage,   says  Marano.  Finally, Marano states:    I think it is extremely  important that women of all different kinds of  interests who are concerned about what's happening in women's lives are getting together to see  what we can do.     I think we all know what our lives are like and  what the lives of women around us are like.  Now is the time for us to use what we know.  We must develop very strong sophisticated  political strategies...,  says Cindy Marano  of WOW.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  1RCWN   BQAKt?  If You Kids Don't   Stop ....  by  PAT   HEIDENREICH  The ultimate torture of a nerve-frazzled parent is to be  confined in an automobile with the kids.   Their voices  seem magnified 1, 000 times.   What are you doing with my best sweater on?  I see it  there under your stupid jacket.   MOM I   That dumb ugly  creep has my sweater on again.    Well, you always wear my Youth-Power tee-shirt.    If I catch you going in my room again I'll knock  your idiotic head off.    I wouldn't go into your smelly room if I had to.    Then how did you get my sweater, you ignorant slob?    I found it behind the davenport, so THERE    Blaaaaaah     If you kids don't quiet down, I'll have a wreck.    Well, tell that nerd to shut up and stay out of my room '   No more arguing    Let's listen to the radio,   I  bribed.   Everybody be quiet. They're playing my favorite song,  Mom.   ( One is the loneliest number that you'll ever know,    the radio blared.    Two can be as bad as one... )   I wish I was an Oscar-Meyer weiner,   interrupted an  off-key voice from the back seat.   SHUT UP, you loud mouthed little idiot wart hog   MOM, tell him to shut up.   I can't hear the song.   (Snap.   Off goes the radio.)   I told you kids to quiet down.   There, I almost hit that  Volkswagen.    Pee-Wee Punch   (sock)  ... (thump)... (bang)... (smack)... (screams)... (huffing  and puffing)   If I have to stop this car, I will. Now keep your mitts to  yourself   I screached.   A brilliant idea hit me:   You  know, I've got a tape recorder in the trunk and when your  father hears it tonight he'll be roaring mad and he'll fix  your wagons for good.    Ha-ha-ha.   He's in Chicago this week, remember?    I wish you kids would show a little brotherly and sisterly love and kindness.    Who could love that hairy mongrel?    And who could like that freaked out fruit tree?    Just remember that you children are of the same flesh  and blood.    (Violent sounds of gagging come from the back seat.)   Look, see the cows,   I said in desperation.   They remind me of HER     And those fat dirty hogs over there remind me of you.  So THERE.   Blaaaaaah     You know, if you keep up this fighting, you'll drive  me crazy    A small voice mumbled,  At least you won't need much  gas cause you're almost there.   I couldn't take it anymore.   I stopped the car, rested my  head and arms on the steering wheel.  Silence ensued.  Then from the back seat...  Now see what YOU did.  She's finally cracked.    Well, it's YOUR fault, you big dilly goon bar    (Sounds of hitting began again.)   Darn,   I thought, as I raised my head and started the  engine again.    Even THAT didn't work.   NWSA Tension  Tension marred the May 31-June 4 conference  of the National Women's Studies Association in  Storrs, Connecticut. Much criticism arose from  the expensive registration and room fees which  prohibited many women from attending, especially those from the Third World.  Adrienne Rich and Audre Lorde addressed the  opening session on the conference's theme.  Many felt that the conference's theme, racism,  was poorly handled. In consciousness raising groups  women with similiarities were placed together.  Therefore, white women were grouped by class and  marital status, while minority women were placed  together in one session listed as  Women of Color.    Women from outside the United States objected to  this grouping because they did not recognize themselves as  women of color  nor were the issues of  racism the same as those found in black-white interactions. There were no groups of white and  Third World women together, ther y closing the  door on any real discussion of racism.  Because many women were angry with this  structure, an alternative C-R group was established,  which included minority, international, white, and  Jewish women.  The conference did end on a hopeful note as the  NWSA promised to use racism as next year's theme  and also allow Third World women to have a substantial role in workshop planning.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  I've Just Been Watching  The champions of the world  Because they endure  What would drive others  crazy....  by CAROL ANN WILDS  Indianapolis, IN  You see them all,  struggling to keep their sanity.  Pacing,  Staring out the windows  in a 6 foot by 8 foot room.  Casually  picking up conglomerations of creams,  oils,  and beauty lotions.  Recognizing any and all attempts to  fill in,  an empty space in time.  Fruitless efforts.  Doors banging and clanging  and vocal chords sounding the same.  Who are they?  The inmates of the Indiana State Women's Prison.  You watch the sun set.  You move past another day,  never travel into it.  All good things  function  outside.  You have your own little world.  You see,  the wind moving,  You don't feel it  in here.  You smoke another cigarette.  Drink another cup of coffee  (if you can afford it)  and pray you don't become  another institutional fixture  ranting -- raving -- and hoarding state tobacco,  beggin' coffee like a Junkie  in need of a fix.  You produce, you inject, and  you take away.  You concieve,  ideas, thoughts, and  babies.  You entertain no one  except yourself and most of the time  not even that.  Feet shuffle,  scrape the floor.  No one picks them up,  it's too fast to do that.  You have to fill in  that time.  You drag.  You create.  You tear down,  and you wait for a chance  to start over.  But even that doesn't come.  You move and you  re-move,  things that get in your way,  and  those that don't.  Jenna's still there  Jenaa Kelsie, who was supposed to be freed on July  28, 1981 --IF she had not been granted a re-trial,  is still at the Indiana Women's Prison in Indianapolis.  The 7th Qrcuit Court of Appeals has ordered that  Jenna Pauline Kelsie, convicted of the murder of her  ex-husband, remain in prison until the State appeals  the U.S. District Court ruling that would grant her a  new trial.  In January, 1981, the U.S. District Judge Gene E.  Brooks had ordered the state to retry Kelsie within six  months.  Kelsie, 47, has been in prison since 1974 She was  convicted of 2nd Degree murder (minimum sentence  15 to 25 years). She shot Dale Graham during an altercation on Oct. 6, 1973 while he was trying to bite out  her eyes  In a letter dated Aug. 5 Kelsie says she:  hasn't made  it out yet .   . but hopefully it will be soon.    You try to touch and  refuse to be touched  because you can't stand the closeness.  Nothing is lost in your efforts except  time.  You're rewarded and you're praised and  you're persecuted.  You're empty, then full, and then you're  drained again.  When it's there,  you feel it.  When it goes away,  it's just gone.  --And  you wait --  for it to come back again.  You spend days, weeks, months,  and then your commissary money.  Then you stop,  and you start,  and you idle.  You waste nothing.  You want nothing,  and you feel nothing,  except when it hurts.  You take time,  in order to give time away.  But you never feel ripped off.  On second thought,  I guess you do.  You're patient.  You're impatient, and  you tolerate...  You're still waiting and you think,  perhaps today.  Then, perhaps today  it won't.  So you wait.  Here today  tomorrow's gone.  Nothing lasts forever  but you think it will.  So you wait and hope  that it will not.  And try to stay sane  just in case  it does....  From  Sex Behind Bars?   Series by Diane Frederick and Therese Iknovian.  August 10-12,  Indianapolis News   I believe there has been sexual harassment.  I got a kiss from a guard once while I was  mopping the hallway.   They (the guards) are  not supposed to even touch us.   (IWP inmate)   There are no men around here to harass anybody  The men here are real nice.   (IWP inmate)   No one has harassed me personally, but I  can't say no one's done it to anyone else    (IWP inmate)  Regarding Carol Ann Wilds' allegations of sexual  exploitation, Gertrude Baniszewski,  convicted torture  slayer of 16-year-old Sylvia Likens in July 1965,  says:  She's not going to get us to side with that  filth she's doing.    A male (IWP) staff member called the charges  (of sexual exploitation) a 'crock'.     He added,  however,   If I had to get up on the stand and say,  'I know there is no sexual harassment,' I couldn't  do that.

The vigil was coordinated by J.R. Lawrence(L) shown here being interviewed by Marily Mitzel of Channel 6 (WRTV) of  Indianapolis. (Photo by Katie Niles)  Blue Ribbon Citizens' Committee  Since its inception in May 1981, the Blue Ribbon  Citizens Committee has been denied (verbally and  in writing) access to the Indiana State Women's  Prison in Indianapolis. Phone calls to the prison  have not been returned even on points of information or inquiry.  Except for individual letters and limited individual visitations from and to various inmates  corroborating Carol Ann Wilds' story and/or dealing with other problems, an  iron curtain  stands  between the citizens committee and the IWP.  The BRCC was formed to begin preliminary investigation into the sexual exploitation that exists in whatever amount in the IWP.  Brought about by the Carol Ann Wilds ' story,  which documents pregnancy, poor medical care,  venereal disease, and general harassment, the  committee had hoped to discuss these and other  problems with other inmates.  The four women who requested a tour of the  facilities originally had no organizational backing  at the time and represented no group. (See Iss. 18)  Although continually thwarted in its attempts  to work for the women in the prison,   individual  members of the BRCC will still monitor as best  they can what happens and what doesn't happen  at the prison. The committe   is no longer meeting, but can re-group at any time and add members at any time  and/or merge with or work with  other groups. . . and would like to do so .  One organization that will be watching what  happens at the IWP and at co-ed Westville Correctional Facility is the Indiana National Organization for Women. Indiana NOW passed a resolution at July State Conference in Ft. Wayne. The  resolution opposes sexual exploitation of women  prisoners and renews its support for women in prison and resolves to consider its own investigation.  The resolution also suggests that each chapter  of Indiana NOW hold one meeting a year to discuss the Indiana women in prison.  This resolution  came out of a workshop entitled:  Locked Up and Out  and was conducted  by Judith La Fourest, Editor of WOMANKIND and  chair of the Blue Ribbon Committee.  La Fourest used letters from Wilds and other  prisoners, pictures, information published in other  publications in other cities, personal information,  plus the front page story in Issue 18 of WO MAN KEN D  as the basis for the workshop. La Fourest will speak  at a Bloomington, Indiana NOW meeting this fall  and is available for other groups. Call 317-542-  0228 for more information and/or scheduling.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  10.  A Case of Mistaken Identity  by RENE M. EVENSON  Lexington, KY  They had been best friends all through junior high,  high school, and college.   They still lived in Hoopers-  ville, yet they never saw each other any more.  Til call her, she thought.   But that evening John  had a toothache and Jerry worked late.    I'll call  tomorrow night,     she told the telephone.   She said  the same thing the next night, and the next night,  and the next.   Finally , her old friend  Sarah slipped  out of her mind.  Two months later, she was shopping at the Big Star  when she recognized Sarah's petite blonde head peering at a can of asparagus.   Sarah Kennedy where have you been?  she said  pushing her cart rapidly up the aisle.   She knew she  was mistaken when the woman turned a frown her  way; Sarah never frowned.  She remembered that the babysitter was charging  her  2.50 and hour, so she mustn't dawdle.   And  Jerry wanted her to pick up something    What was  it?  She ma de a mental note to call Sarah that  evening to tell her the funny thing that happened  at the grocery store.  Saturday evening was the annual spring Optimists'  Dance;  she and Jerry always attended.   This year  they had the entire hall decorated in a Tarzan of  the Apes motif, and the men and women were dressing accordingly.   She didn't know what to wear.  Sarah, not she, had been the imaginative one while  they were in college.   She had majored in physical  education, then she me t Jerry.   They fell in love  and immediately got married.   Jerry finished his  degree in accounting, but she needed too many  hours to finish in P.E. Besides, she was pregnant  with John.  The evening of the dance, she and Jerry showed  up at the hall in matching khaki shorts, shirts,  and plastic safari hats covered with magnolia leaves.  Jim and Bernice Sapperstein were dressed in leopard  About WOMANKIND  E.K. Bramblett (Mayflower Classic article,  see p.3) is a new member of the WOMANKIND  staff.

There seemed to be some disagreement about what Tarzan and Jane would wear.  Drinking another cup of punch, she leaned against  the imitation grass shack and looked at the dancers.  Jerry danced with Bernice and every time he shook  his hips the magnolia leaves fell off his hat.  A  woman in a beautiful floor length white gown danced  past, and she knew it must be Sarah.   Who else but  Sarah would wear a white gown?  Dare she rush out on the dance floor?   She decided  to wait until the dance was over.   Meanwhile, she  got another cup of unspiked punch.   The khaki was  hot, and she knew she had big perspiration stains  under her arms.   Then the dance ended, she tried to  get through the crowd to talk to Sarah, but before  she could, the woman in the white gown disappeared.  Summer passed, then fall, and she found herself  shopping for Christmas presents in Memphis.   She  loved the nativity scenes, the colored lights strung  along the streets, and the smell of hot apple cider  and cinnamon that floated through Woolworth's  On the corner of Fourth and Louisiana, a woman  was arranging a store window, draping the walls with  swatches of fabric and positioning mannequins who were  wrapped warmly in thick furs.   She felt as if she recognized the way the woman's waist was settled on her hips,  the flex and stretch of the legs and the arms.  The woman turned to face her through the window,  aware perhaps that she was the object of staring eyes.  Seconds passed and then the woman began to give her  nasty looks and she moved nervously in the window,  so she finally walked on.  When she got home that evening she couldn't wait to  tell Jerry.    Jerry guess what I saw today?  A woman  that looks just like me    Jerry shook his head, smiled, and placed his hands  under her chin.    Now tell me,   he said tilting her head  backward,   how can there be anyone else in this world  as beautiful as my Sarah?

        <pagetext>Belden's   Legacy  WOMANKIND  by MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  Indianapolis,  IN  1 1  In the not-too-long ago, an ailing Lord called his son  home from school, to assume his duties.   The son was a  good student and quickly learned to create good will  among his people and to mete justice to the peasants who  worked the farms, who tended the animals and v*h o kept  the manor comfortable, its inhabitants well fed, and  decently clad.  One such peasant was Bede, who lived in a neat little  cottage with his wife, Aletia, and their only child,  Belden. Belden was smallish and flaxen-haired and of  so noticeable an intellect that the Manor Priest had  volunteered instruction.  Other cottagers were resentful of the fact that Bel- '  den did little farm work and were heard to mutter:   Belden's head will be addled with all that printing  and numbers.    When, one day, Bede fell ill while tending his fields,  they were gratified to see Belden forsake the books in  favor of saving Bede's crops. As the crops were gathered,  a house page brought news of the old Lord's death.  After the Old Lord's funeral, the Young Lord called a  meeting of all the cottage elders. To each man he gave  a new gold piece, explaining that this had been his father's wish, and that each man would be asked one year  hence for an accounting of how he had cared for the  money. One of the cottagers volunteered to take Bede's  coin to him. When he arrived, he found Bede dying.  The coin then was presented to Belden as Bede's  dying request.  Bede's funeral follow his Lord's funeral by two days.  Then the cottages were intent on getting in their  crops and making ready for winter. None thought to  explain to young Belden the words of the new Lord's  concerning  the accounting of the gold piece.  Time passed and when the fields lay fallow, Belden took  the coin into the city. After questioning those who knew  investments and only after much study, Belden's coin was  invested in a coal-mining venture. Soon the project flourished and with the proceeds the investors bought more  mineral rights and brought in more coal fields, so that in  less than one year, Belden was moderately prosperous.  This prosperity did not cause Belden to swerve from duty:  the Lord's land was farmed and tended so well that Belden'     crops were the richest and Belden's barns were the fullest  in the entire Manor.    Then came the day of reckoning.  Jealous of their affluence, the neighbors had not told  Belden nor her mother that the gold coin must be accounted for.   One year had passed and they asked:  Where will  you tell the new Lord you spent his coin?    What accounting will you give?

Because of the coin's great beauty, Sire, I fashioned a  dark velvet purse, to protect it from scratches or darkening.   one squeaked.   I carved this beautiful locket of ox-horn, my Lord, to  encase your coin. I trust you will approve?   And so it went. They had all kept their gold coins.  Then Belden stood before the young Lord, slight and  shining golden hair a tumbling halo:    My Lord, I  considered the gold piece you loaned to my father as  another worker in your land; to be used, not to be set  aside,  idle.   So, I put it to work in the coal fields,  where its labors brought fruit.   I return hot one golden  coin to you, but ten gold pieces, Sire.   Too, my  mother and I have profited well in this endeavor, and  for this I thank you    The Lord said,  Thank you, Belden  Now, I charge  you all: Has any other worker more than ten pieces of  gold to return to me?    All hung their heads in silence.   Belden, approach me     He held out his hand and  continued,   I have need of a Steward of the Exchequer.   Before his death my father advised this manner  of finding the man best suited for that job.   'Give  each  a bit of gold,' he said, 'and hire that man who  returns the most to you.'    But I cannot admit you to the Chamber of Peers,  Belden, nor can I call you my Steward, nor pay you a  Steward's salary, for you are a mere woman, not a man.  So I will hereby create for you and all capable women  who follow you the Office of Secretary    You will do  the work of a Steward; therefore you will be permitted  to sit in the big room outside the Steward's offices.  All Stewards and other folk will speak in recognition  as they pass you,  and you will bring coffee, drinks, and  finished correspondence and thus serve my Steward and  your Lord quite well.

Maybe I will  pop  in one of these days.  I am the treasurer for the local Women's Commission  and am interested in subjects and activities you announce.  I found your Carol Wild's acticle straight-hitting,  brutal ai d very necessary for citizens to know about.  I also enjoyed your mention of the Nancy Scott/  Worth Hartman wedding.   Worth is a former high school  classmate, happy to hear about him   Sincerely,  Jennifer Bohrnstedt  Bloomington, IN  Please send me a sample copy of WOMANKIND,  as described in the Fort Wayne JOURNAL-GAZETTE.  Thank you.   A check for  1.00 is enclosed.  Shirley Meister  Indpls. IN  I believe in WOMANKIND.. .enter my subscription.  Great accomplishments are not born from logic.  They happen when somewhere, someone dares to  stand up and say:    A publication by, about and for  women -- I think they'll go for it    Beth Corbin  Ft. Meyers, FL  Thank you for your note and the sample copies of  WOMANKIND.   I was particularly happy to see that my  good friend, Arline Chase, of Cambridge, Maryland,  was included in that issue --as well as several other  women I have met through the International Women's  Writing Guild.

        <pagetext>Page 2  WOMANKIND  Perspectives On The International Women's Year  High School Student's  View of Houston IWY  By BETH RAGO  Women have begun crashing the gates of sexist  society with the extreme success of the National  Women's Conference in Houston, November 18-21. Over  1,400 delegates, chosen by open state and territory-wide  conventions, gathered to vote on a National Plan of Action, a total of 26 women's resolutions to recommend to  the President and Congress.  I got to go there.  Spread out over the floor of a Houston convention center were hundreds of women committed to equal rights  (quite a sight for a sore-eyed feminist with Backlash  Blues). Bella Abzug, introducer of the original bill to  direct and organize a National Women's Conference,  moved to and from the podium, overseeing with an  Eastern twang. Several thousand observers sat noisily  in seats above the floor hanging freedom banners over the  walls and whooping at nearly everything. Most  delegates boasted a  Pro Plan  button. And the world  wondered if so many different women could agree on  anything.  THE WOMEN agreed on EVERYTHING that called for  basic human rights. Each resolution was famously  anounced and the floor then was opened for debate.  Microphones, eight of them, stood scattered about the  floor and any delegate could talk into one. Parliamentary questions would take precedence and were always  answered first. Pro and con discussion followed.  The  anti-everything  delegates, of which there were  approximately 400, diligently tried to disrupt progress  rather than legally and intelligently debate it. Many  times  anti  delegates would take to the mikes with   questions  (that parliamentary take precedence) and  then sneakily stick in a debate comment. The leaders of  the session quickly and correctly ruled the pathetic outbursts out of order. This brought small angry cries from  negative delegations, 30 of which were from good old Indiana.  JOAN GUBBINS, INDIANA STATE Senator and   anti  ringleader, wore a huge yellow hat and flashed  racing flags to instruct her troops how to vote.  Joan had little effect.  Delegates dedicated to human equality calmy flowed  past the nuisances like a huge strong ocean wave.  Free women are the most colorful people. Women  lined the streets outside the convention halls, shaking  gourds and singing,  Tell it like it is, sisters, tell it like it  is.  A New York woman handed out armbands to signify   sexual preference,  which is homosexual freedom. An  entire auditorium was packed with feminist exhibits,  store booths, info tables, books, and T-shirt peddlers.  Fat women in overalls and gorgeous, made-up lady-likes  swarmed the Houston streets. Rosalyn Carter and Betty  Ford and Lady Bird Johnson gave speeches. Betty  Friedan endorsed gay rights after many years of  renouncing them. Women were walking around just  being glad they were women.  NEARLY ALL OF THE 26 resolutions passed as they  were. In a great combined effort, minority and Third  World Women caucused to come up with a substitute for  the Minority Women motion, though. Coretta Scott King  and Asian, Spanish, and Indian-American women read  the new motion, which expanded and defined the  original. It was adopted by a huge standing majority of  the delegates. The women also rejected a resolution  calling for a separate Cabinet-level office of women.  Maya Angelou, authoress of I Know Why The Caged  Bird Sings opened the session with  ...To Form A More  Perfect Union...,  saying,  We promise to accept  nothing less than justice for every woman.  The work  has begun.  Reprinted from the Shortridge Echo, December 20, 1977.

Womankind Reporter  Covers Houston Conference  By NANCY SCOTT  Womankind cannot forget the roots of her past   the  foremothers and the Founding Mothers of this  nation   for the fighting spirit of her ancestors seems to  live on in her as she continues the struggle for women's  rights.  Seneca Falls, N.Y., was the launching pad of the  women's movement. Houston, 129 years later, was the  site of the first national women's conference to be mandated by the federal government. Over 15,000  Women  on the Move  convened for the International Women's  Year Conference November 18-21  to  assess the  progress that has been made toward insuring equality  for all women, to set goals for the elimination of all  barriers to the full and equal participation of women in  all aspects of American life, and to recognize the importance of the contribution of women to the development of  friendly relations and cooperation among nations and to  the strengthening of world peace  as requested by  Public Law 94-167 enacted by the 94th Congress in 1975.  The largest national convocation of women, the IWY  was supported by five million dollars in public funds.  However, much work was done by volunteers.  The largest national convocations of women ever sponsored by the federal government, the IWY was supported  by five million dollars in public funds. However, much  work was done by volunteers, often at their own expense.  JUST AS .CONGRESS HAD REQUESTED, there was  a   broad   mix   of   representatives.   Two   thousand  delegates represented 56 State and Territorial meetings.  Official international visitors represented 52 countries  from the U.S.S.R. to Guyana. Mothers brought their  daughters so they could  Together, move history forward . Parents brought babies. Women brought friends,  sisters and relatives.  The women spoke different  languages and worked different jobs.  Some were  homemakers; some were rural women. Some were  grandmothers; some were teens. Some were married;  some were single. Some were obviously pregnant. Some  were handicapped.  They were of different social,  economic,  political,  educational,  religious,  cultural,  ethnic and racial backgrounds. The famous and the  unknown were there because they were concerned about  womankind, because they wanted to see herstory-in-the-  making.   The delegates of this conference are certainly not of  a single mind,  said Rep. Barbara Jordan in her keynote  address. She said participants should  not allow themselves to be brainwashed by people who predict chaos  and failure for us. Tell them they lie, and move on,  she  said.  The crowd applauded and started chanting,  ERA,  ERA.   JORDAN COMMENTED ON the serious intent of the  conference and cautioned the women that  Not making  a difference is a cost we cannot afford.  She received a  standing ovation, In this spirit, the conference was  opened.  The list of notables was seemingly endless. Everyone  from Patsy Mink to Margaret Mead was there. Rosalynn  Carter, Lady Bird Johnson and Betty Ford made a  simultaneous appearance and endorsed the goals of the  conference.   I once thought the women's movement belonged  more to my daughters than to me, but I have come to  know that it belongs to women of all ages,  said Mrs.  Johnson.  EARLY IN THE PROGRAM women remarked on the  political clout their numbers could muster as they cited  examples of elected officials ousted from office and the  successful economic boycott against states not having  ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. Before the conference ended, many pledged to join in the boycott.  IWY Commmissioner Liz Carpenter, former Press  Secretary to Lady Bird Johnson, called women   America's greatest untapped energy resource   set  aside for 201 years   misused and unused   a fuel that  comes with brains. We are the people left out in  Philadelphia. And the irony   the real irony   is that  there would have been no America without us,  she  said.  There were many moving moments during the conference. The gavel presented by the National American  Woman Suffrage Association to Susan B. Anthony in 1896  was used to open and close the IWY.  WHEN RUNNERS PRESENTED Dr. Susan B. Anthony II with the flaming bronze torch they had carried  oh a 2,612 mile trek from Seneca Falls, some people were  brought to tears. Others hugged, most cheered and  nearly everyone stood tall and proud.   You have finished one race   the race begun by our  Founding Mothers at Seneca Falls in 1848,  said Anthony. She reminded the assemblage that we now race  for the  imperishable wreath, saying with our one voice  as did Aunt Susan when she finished her life long race,  'FAILURE IS IMPOSSIBLE'.   Presiding officer Bella Azbug noted that the torch is   a symbol of our past victories and our hopes for future  ones.   The IWY was clearly a victory for the 80 per cent who  supported the  National Plan of Acton,  a document of  26 major topics relating to women. Twenty-five of twenty-six were passed by the Conference with few or no  changes. The National Plan that was adopted will be  sent to the President and Congress not later than March,  1978. The President will present his recommendations to  Congress no later than 120 days afterwards.  (Continued to Page 10)

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Page 3  Forum On Abortion  Ministry of Reconciliation  By JANE FRIBLEY  Needed today is the moderate, the reconciler. Great  are the pressures of the extreme right or left polarizing  persons and groups against one another, refusing to   give an inch , sure their  rightness  justifies using  any methods.  Reconciler does not mean no decisions but decisions  are based on study from reliable sources and varying  positions, discussions, prayer and with charity towards  the opposition. We cannot become experts on every  issue. Sometimes we have to decide whom to trust and  follow.  THE  MIDDLE OF THE ROAD  is not an easy place  to be. One gets buffeted and sometimes battered by  those on either side. Yet, on many issues there is no  unquestionable right or wrong.  An example is abortion, an issue many of us until  recently spoke of only behind closed doors. Now all  media forms are full of it. Church Women United has  no position on abortion rights. Our members, individuals  and denominations, vary. We do agree that neither abortion or unwanted pregnancy is the best answer.  We know: Unwanted children are the most often  abused; most unwanted children are non-adoptables;  the media encourages illicit sex and glamourizes unwed  motherhood; abortions have been prevalent since  prehistoric times and will continue, legal or not; a person with a sense of self worth is less inclined to  promiscuity.  LIFE IS MORE THAN BIRTH. Are we prepared to  provide life   physical, spiritual, mental and emotional  to all who are born? Are we really concerned about life  for all humanity   unwed mothers, criminals, handicapped, poor, elderly, minorities, etc.?  What can we  Middle of the roaders  do? We can influence the media to treat sex as a God given responsibility and gift; research for birth control methods  compatible with health and religious beliefs and for men  as well as women; research prevention of birth defects  and pregnancy complications; provide moral, sex,  family life and parenting education; improve detection,  treatment and confinement for sexual criminals; increase private and government provisions for unwanted  and under cared for children.  A big order? yes  But the millions being spent over the  abortion issue could go far toward removing the  problems that create the issue.  Abortion, The Law and the  Right to Life Movement  By MARY ANN DOLATOWKSI  Abortion, or the practice of termination of pregnancy  by artificial means, has existed since the beginning of  history. The earliest abortifacient recipe is more than  4,500 years old and it has been found that the most  primitive peoples all over the world practiced abortion  within their societies. In some early societies it was used  in conjuntion with infanticide as a method of population  control and legal sanctions were minimal to nonexistent. In other societies, such as those found in the  ancient Middle East, the law provided sanctions that  were both compensatory and punitive. However, where  sanctions against abortion did appear they were not  usually in recognition of the unborn child as a human  being, but rather were focused on social injury   the  protection of the health of the mother and the property  rights of the father. With the rise of Christianity the emphasis in society (but not necessarily codified law) shifted to that of the protection of the life and soul of the  fetus.  Abortion before  quickening  was not proscribed in  the western world before the 19th century and in the  United States abortion laws did not appear until 1835.  Available evidence indicates that the purpose of these  laws was not concerned with the rights of the embryonic  or fetal life, but rather with the protection of the health  of women against the dangers of abortional surgery. The  laws when written were health measures not inspired by  theology. Legally they could be regarded as being within  the purview of the state's right to legislate in the area of  health for the state has a compelling interest in the  protection of the health of its citizens. The advent of antisepsis and improved medical techniques obviated the  need for such laws, but as late as 1967, they remained extant with little or no clamor from the American public  for change. Until 1967 the law governing abortion were  very narrow and rigidly applied. In all states abortion  was allowed to save the life of the mother in  life or  death  medical situations. Two states also allowed abortion to prevent serious and permanent bodily injury to  the mother. Three states allowed abortion to protect the  health of the mother. Ironically, seven states allowed  abortion to save the life of the child. This latter statute  was for the protection of doctors from punitive action  when they induced labor to save the life of the child, but  were unsuccessful. Abortion in cases of rape, incest, and  possible genetic deformities or natal deformities as a  (Continued to Page 4)  Abortion and the  Moral  Factor  By RITA PALMER  ON JUNE 25 the Supreme Court practically reversed its  1973 ruling that any woman has a constitutional right to an  abortion in the first three months of her pregnancy:  federal funds are no longer allotted for free and medically  safe abortions. Then on July 15th President Carter, that  great champion of human rights (in Russia), had this to  say about it:  There are many things in life that are not  fair, that wealthy people can afford and poor people can't.  I don't believe that the federal government should take  action to try to make these opportunities exactly equal,  particularly where there is a moral factor involved.   (Ital.R.E.P.)  These remarks have been called  outrageous  and   callous , but there is an odor here suggesting something  even worse than simple indifference to the plight of the  poor. The italicized clause is what does it. It is sheer  hypocrisy to drag in a  moral factor  which will condemn  indigent women only, but magically ceases to be a matter  of morality at all (which in fact makes abortion an  opportunity , even a luxury) whenever a woman's bank account is fat enough. It is about time, one feels, for Mr. Carter to drop his pose as moral and religious mentor of this  nation, and the world, and face up to the logic of the  situation.  Either abortion is sometimes ethical or it is always  murder. If it is always murder, even at the embryonic  stage, and even when desperately needed for health or  economic reasons, then it is doubly murderous for affluent  people, who might more easily have avoided the pregnancy to begin with, and who certainly can better cope with  any health problems involved. But if in many cases abortion (in the embryonic stage) is ethically justifiable  because it is desperately needed, then the capacity to pay  should not enter into the discussion at this late date. Why,  after four years, suddenly draw the line here?  CLEARLY THERE HAS BEEN pressure from an increasingly powerful coalition of right-wing forces; and  Carter (as well others, in Congress and elsewhere) has  responded willingly,  if still rather cautiously.  This  coalition is made up of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, the  conservative Caucus, the John Birchers, the  Right-To-  Lifers , the Eagle Forum, the Mormon and fundamentalist churches, and other well-funded, mutually helpful,  and highly-organized groups. Nothing the President has  done up to now shows quite so clearly as does this  statement on abortion his basically right-wing orientation  and the moral mask he wears to hide it.  Nevertheless abortion IS a profoundly moral issue.  Every human being's right to life is inalienable. The  problem begins when we ask at what point a human being,  AS SUCH, begins to be; and regardless of Catholic bishops  and other  Right-To-Lifers , it was wise and fair to set  the boundary at the end 6T the embryonic period. Before  that easily determined point every woman still has the  LEGAL  right to choose  in terms of her own problem. I  view of the limitations of the courts and medical and  social agencies, and their possible prejudices, no one else  can be trusted to judge fairly.  For the right to life involves other factors. Just WHOSE  life are we talking about   the mother's or the embryo's?  More importantly, what do we mean by LIFE? Do we  mean fullness of life   with dignity, reasonable health,  some opportunity for joy   and, for the child, the  cherishing love of at least one parent? Or do we mean  mere biological survival: a childhood of unavoidable  neglect, and perhaps malnutrition and congenital  disease; and for the mother, increased poverty, bitterness, drudgery, failing health?  IN HIS CAMPAIGN SPEECHES the President said  much about compassion. Has he forgotten that every year  an appalling number of pregnancies occur among 13-to-16-  year-old girls   many of them runaways, some of them  already tainted by venereal disease, all of them foolish  and irresponsible? And that there are countless married  women at the poverty level (many of them working outside the home) who are already weakened by too many  pregnancies? (It is precisely in such families that effective contraceptive measures have been most difficult to  take.) As desperately as they need food and shelter, these  girls and women need free abortion clinics, with a  thorough follow-up of free contraceptive aid.  But if Carter has jettisoned compassion from his moral  luggage, prudence and economy remain stalwart moral  virtues. Every year the federal government spends  billions on Welfare in the attempt to make certain  necessities available even to  the poor . Social prudence  and economy, as well as social ethics, dictate a long look  into the future. Federal funds put into free abortion  facilities would be a wise investment.  Oh Joyce, I'm Sorry But...  By SUZANNE PEROZZI  Almost two years ago to this day, I lost a friend, or  rather a friendship, built solidly (I'd thought) on exchanged advice about kids and casseroles, husbands and  hemlines, and even, sometimes on a more cerebral kind  of conversation. I've forgotten the exact content of the  exchanges   all but one, that is. On that day, Joyce, my  next-door-neighbor, with a deep-eyed, weary look, a  consequence of frequent pregnancies, rushed into my  kitchen, blurting her dilemma:  I'm pregnant again.  And Dr. Perell says to consider abortion. That I should  live for the family I have now. What do you think?   In essence, I answered,  Oh, Joyce. I'm sorry, but I've  never been able to rationalize abortion.  And I  proceeded to stack my thoughts in front of her, like so  many slats in a blind, lacing them with a few cords of  guilt, designed to pull at her conscience. Two weeks  later, Joyce had the abortion anyway and thereafter,  uncharacteristically startled many a newcomer at  neighborhood parties with the details of her abortion,  pouring the points of my argument and her refutation of  them into the ear of any available listener. Her explanations must have had a certain cathartic effect on  her, because, in time, she became the quiet listener  she'd always been. But our closeness was gone. We had  shut the blind between us when I gave her those cords of  guilt to wrestle with and ruminate upon.  TO THIS DAY I'VE regretted that I couldn't tell Joyce  what she wanted to hear. I, too, would like to believe in  abortion. It can ease individual pain   physical and  psychological, and it can reduce the number and variety  of social and/or welfare ills. But I can't condone that  which I consider morally wrong, that which denies  man's and woman's most basic right, the right to life.  And because abortion is morally wrong, it should be  outlawed once again.  To believe in outlawing abortion, however, one must  accept the premise that abortion is wrong by the nature  of the following definition. Abortion is the INTENTIONAL destruction of unborn human life, life which  begins at the moment of fertilization. Pro-abortionists  say that the child in the womb or the embryo (the human  organism from conception up to three months) or the  fetus (the offspring in the womb from the end of the third  month of pregnancy till birth) is not a human, or a person. Various pro-abortionists have tried to settle on a  time at which the embryo or fetus becomes a person,  saying that if the abortion is performed before this time,  the abortion is not a criminal act. To me, that they have  failed to define the point at which a  person  begins is  unimportant. It is not a dog's or cat's embryo; it is a  human's   with the capacity to develop into a rational  and emotional human being.  (Continued to Page 4)  The Freedom Of Choice  By SUSAN TRIPPET  During the twentieth century women have made great  strides in achieving their political, educational and  professional freedom. In the last ten years they have also  been changing their attitudes about their bodies. Women  want the freedom of choice to have the physical appearance they want to have, to have sexual relationships  if they desire, and to have the option of whether to have  children. Unfortunately, for centuries men have  traditionally controlled women's alternatives to childbirth either socially or legislatively.  Nineteen hundred and seventy-three was a year of  sexual victory for women: the United States House and  Senate passed a law stating that abortion was legal and  the various states passed their own laws as to what  gestational age the fetus could be aborted legally. Indiana's law states that abortion is legal up to the 12th  week. As a result of this law the health professionals see  very few results of criminal abortion, i.e., sterility, kidney  failure, uncontrolled hemorrhage, septic shock or death.  Today any woman has the option of safely terminating a  pregnancy for her own reasons. Without legalized abortion, abortions will still be done and the possibility of the  increased incidence of child neglect, child abuse and  maternal psychiatric problems will become a reality.  SOME WOMEN MAY NOT BE AWARE of the various  methods of safely aborting at a particular time during  pregnancy. During the first 12 weeks two methods may be  employed: suction curettage and dilatation, and curettage under a local or inhaled anesthetic. In both  procedures the cervix is dilated and the uterine contents  are evacuated by either suction or scraping. From the  12th to the 24th week the current method of choice is an intra-abdominal instillation of either prostaglandin (a  natural hormone) or a salt solution to induce uterine contractions and thus empty the uterine contents. Of the  methods described suction curettage under a local  anesthetic is the safest procedure. Needles to say,  adequate pre and post-abortion counseling are necessary  for every woman's well-being. Also, women undergoing  an abortion need the support and understanding from  other women.  (Continued to Page 4)

        <pagetext>Page 4  ABORTION. THE LAW AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE  MOVEMENT  consequence of drugs or disease contracted by the  mother during pregnancy were illegal under existing  statutes.  THE STRINGENCY OF the law, its application and  criminalization of the abortion procedure had a decided  adverse impact on society. It provided an economic  basis for illicit, black market operations and encouraged  police corruption for the laws were virtually unenforceable. All this led to a thriving practice for criminal  abortionists who were rarely even remotely connected  to the medical field although there were doctors who for  either mercenary or humane reasons performed abortions. Abortion became the third largest criminal endeavor surpassed only by narcotics and gambling. An  estimate in 1951 indicated that 330,000 criminal abortions  were performed annually and of this number 300,000  were performed by a criminal abortionist with a good  portion of the balance being women who had attempted  self-induced abortion to the detriment of their lives.  Statistics indicated that of these numbers 5-6,000 deaths  resulted annually and a disproportionate number were  Black and single women for the ability to pay became  the criteria as to the quality of the surgical procedure  performed. This quite naturally led to less competent  and safe treatment for most single, minority and  working class women.  Abortionists who charged high fees did so partially to  absorb the costs of payoffs to the police and other officials. Those who did not maintain a payoff system  could charge lower fees thereby making their services  available to some women in the lower socioeconomic  strata of society, but this required that they be highly  mobile to avoid detection which resulted in a proportionate decrease in the quality and safety of the care  they provided. The rationale shared by law enforcement  personnel to justify their acceptance of bribes and  payoff money was  ...that the abortionist is in fact performing a useful service,  and that they were  ...aware  of public indifference to strong enforcement of this particular law.  As illustrated the laws were not only unenforceable but resulted in a highly discriminatory  situation for safe   but illegal   abortions. These abortions became available with the indirect protection of  police power only to those who could afford to pay a  premium price.  PUBLIC INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS the abortion  laws began to dissipate in the 1960's. This period saw the  rise of groups of citizens actively working for the reform  and liberalization of abortion laws partly in response to  the ever increasing demand for equality and freedom by  women. The period from 1967 to 1970 saw some  liberalization and reform in the law with the expanding  definition of therapeutic abortion and the inclusion of  pregnancy as the result of rape or abortion as reasons  for abortion in some state laws.  Although liberalization of existing abortion laws was  achieved to some degree the effect of the general  population of women in this country was minimal. Access to abortion was limited to women who could travel  to one of the three states where abortion was permitted  in most cases or who were aware of the laws governing  therapeutic abortion and who had access to a doctor who  would agree abortion was indicated and who could convince a review board that abortion was required. All of  which effectively precluded women from the poor and  working classes from having a legal abortion. Statistics  show that during this period New York City, with one of  the most liberal abortion laws, had 1 abortion for every  250 live births in private hospitals while in municipal  hospitals that cared for the poor the rate was 1 abortion  for every 10,000 live births. Further, the decline in illegal  abortions as a result of the liberalization of the laws was  negligible.  THIS   WELL-RESEARCHED   ARTICLE   WILL  BE  CONTINUED IN OUR NEXT ISSUE.  WOMANKIND  OH, JOYCE. I'm SORRY BUT...  THIS EMBRYO DEVELOPS HUMAN OR  person   characteristics very early. In the third to fourth week of  existence, the embryo is forming arms, legs, a spinal  cord, brain, lungs, stomach, liver, kidneys and a pumping heart. By the sixth to eighth week, all organs are  present, the tongue formed, the brain complete. The  embryo even has fingerprints  By the twelfth week, all  body stystems are working; the embryo can feel pain  and only has to grow. However, even if an abortion  should be performed before any of these capabilities appear, it still would be destroying a person or human,  because when the male germ cell fertilizes the female  reproductive cell the capacity for human life is set in  motion. With this action, the human potentialities are  started on their course of development.  Pro-abortionists have other arguments, hard ones,  that can involve painful personal decisions. They ask:  what if the embryo or fetus is less than whole or is  damaged in some awful way? what if the mother's life is  endangered? My answer is that the initial obligation is to  defend the first and primary right OF life.  Secondly, my answer to the  impaired fetus   argument is that before birth no one can predict very  accurately how the child, after birth, may develop his  potential. For example, Lord Byron was born with a club  foot; yet if he hadn't been born, the world would have  been denied a great poet. History is rich with people who  might have been likely game for the abortionist.  Leonardo da Vinci was illegitimate. Benjamin Franklin  was the youngest of 19 children. Culturally, the world  would be much poorer had either of their mothers  desired the opportunity and choice of abortion.  Somewhat more recently, another mother of a highly  gifted human being had that choice. In February of 1966,  Arthur Rubinstein was quoted by TIME magazine:  My  mother did not want a seventh child, so she decided to  get rid of me before I was born. Then...my aunt  dissuaded her...It was a miracle.  In abortion, the unborn fetus becomes the victim and is denied not only the  right to life but also the chance to develop his potentialities.  Last, when pro-abortionists argue that abortion should  be allowed if the mother's life is endangered, the  argument enters into the realm of moral  reasonableness. The persons responsible for the lives of  the mother and the fetus are morally obligated to protect  and to promote those lives. However, in cases of ectopic,  or tubal, pregnancy or cancer of the uterus, abortion  should take place, because in these instances, the  destruction of the fetus is NOT intentional, but  necessary to save the life of the mother. If tubal  pregnancy is allowed to continue, the unborn child is  trapped in a fallopian tube, and as he grows, the tube  bursts approximately eight weeks after conception,  causing severe rupturing, which leads to the mother's   death. Here the child has become the aggressor. Since  everyone has the right to defend against a real threat to  her/his life, abortion, in this instance is not immoral.  Because the child is not medically viable, that is,  capable of living outside his mother's body eight weeks  after conception, there is no way or hope of saving him.  In the case of uterine cancer, the child is trapped again  in a part of the mother's body, which, if allowed to  remain, definitely would threaten her life. An abortion,  in this case too, is not intended to take the life of the  child and, therefore, is morally reasonable.  In these days of women's liberation and the equal  rights amendment, more and more women are approving and lauding our legalized abortion law. They  say a woman should be able to exercise her right to  privacy, a phrase which may be defined as the freedom  to decide how she will control her own body. But I cannot  justify this argument in the light of the basic right to life.  Is there any equality between the right to life and the  right to privacy? I think not. The right to life should take  precedence. Earnestly, though, a woman with an un-  7461 W. 10th Street  Indianapolis, Indiana 46224  m  Residential  Commercial  Farms  HOMES  BOBBIE BOSE  A Feminist Realtor  Office 271-5555 Residence 244-4876    CK   lt;  tfgM       Pl  5tfo  WOl  4460 Guion Road  299-2750  Classes for Spring Semester  Begin the week of March 26th  Call for a program   Za  j  ,  Open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Daily  5255 N.

I do not WANT this child. The child's being  not wanted, however, is not the child's fault. This  fallacious logic punishes the victim. When the day  dawns that an individual's right to life depends on his  being wanted, others of us will be eligible for the  hangman's noose. The defective, the chronically ill, the  aged   all could find themselves without the right to life  if we follow the theory of the  unwanted  to its conclusion. More to the point, some of these women,  because of their unwanted pregnancies, do face some  real physical and psychological dangers and, I'm sure,  come to regard their unborn children as adversaries,  things to be got rid of. Professor Charles Rice of Notre  Dame Law School said recently in a letter of Advice to  the National Right to Life Committee:   There is no other situation in the law where one is  permitted to kill another innocent non-aggressor even to  save one's life. The unborn child should not be called an  aggressor so as to justify his killing under the principles  of self-defense.   Difficult as her situation may be, the life of the woman  with an unwanted pregnancy is not in truly imminent  danger; that is, her child is not literally killing her. This  child cannot be regarded as a party she faces in a  struggle for life. A morally responsible mother will let  her unborn child's right to life take precedence over her  physical and psychological convenience.  PERHAPS THERE IS ONE HAPPY NOTE in cases of  unwanted pregnancy: adoption agencies are searching  for children. Currently, the demand for these children  far outreaches the supply. One has only to read of the  clamor, probably an overly emotional one, for the South  Vietnamese orphans. On the other hand, in Indianapolis,  the St. Elizabeth's Home, a local private adoption  agency, and the Marion County's adoption bureau both  are telling prospective parents that they will have to  wait at least two and a half years for a baby. So, a  woman with an unwanted pregnancy, who courageously  waits out her term under the guidance of a licensed  agency, will have the emotional security of knowing that  the child will be wanted and well cared for, and that both  the baby and herself have had careful pre- and postnatal treatment. Most important, however, she'll know  that she gave another person his basic right to life and  his right to develop his potentialities.  *******  When I think of Joyce, nervous and upset, listening to  me on that long-ago day, I feel sad for us. Our friendship  is strained and awkward. We see each other still. When  we meet, we force conversation about the old familiar  topics   kids and casseroles, husbands and hemlines, but  the sharing's not the same. I seem unbending, and she,  suspicious. However, even though I fell ill-at-ease in a  cause-conscious role, I'd repeat my argument. We all  are obligated morally, to ourselves and to each other, to  rouse against a wrong.  THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE  With the current debate in Congress, the financial  aspect of abortions needs to be addressed. At present, only  women who can afford abortions have the option to abort a  pregnancy. Again the legislative medium is setting the  limitations and discriminations on women. Yet what  financial considerations are given to women during  pregnancy and delivery? Actually an abortion costs approximately one tenth of the pregnancy and delivery.  In conclusion, abortions are going to be with us legally  or illegally. Legally, abortions help to insure the safety of  women's physical, emotional and mental well-being.  Illegally, abortions degrade women and jeopardize their  physical, emotional and mental health. This author's  opinion is that every woman has the right to make a  decision about her own body. This freedom of choice  should be hers.   tyOrMrtf  6352 W 37th ST IN VIUA6C SQUAftf                 F   MINIST DOOKSTORC specializing in  feminist presses' publications  Non-sexist children's books  Women artists works  Dotiks. music, photography  A UNIQUE PLACE  Plus: posters, stationary,  teeshirts   vibrators  Support Our Advertisers

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Whiteblossom  Burial   There was burying in Whiteblossom this morning,  Doc. Old Man Barger's young grandbaby was finally  lowered to rest after being laid out fer two days in his  momma's front room. Mabel Hignight said fer the whole  time there was clouds rolling down near enough to touch  the trees at the top of the mountains, and fog was hanging  low down in the camp. The way she told it made me mournful.   Mabel runs the drygoods place down in Whiteblossom  and knows near everything that goes on from the birthing  to the burying. She's carried the news over to me ever  since I've been laid up here in the hospital.   So she says them clouds and fog got to mixing and the  air was wet enough it could have been raining all the time,  only she weren't sure, seeing as she was helping out with  the people coming in fer the sitting-in and was too busy to  take notice. More 'an likely it did rain knowing this time  of year when the sun comes out only long enough to take a  bit of the chill away, then hides behind some black cloud  until you're cold again. Seems like these days there ain't  no relying on a full day of sunshine in Whiteblossom.   Sometimes I git to thinking back when the mines was  coughing out coal like there weren't going to be no  tomorrow. Well, seems like folks thought more of each  other. I was young. I started in the mines when I was fif-  ten. Before then I helped my pappy haul small loads down  to Vicco to sell fer a nickle a tub. My pappy signed me up  full-time when I was fifteen. Had to sign. Law said he had  to sign a permit of some kind saying I was eighteen. We  was digging coal at a dollar a day, and I used to take out  fifty cents a week and give the rest to my Ma.   Good times then. That movie house was still standing  down in Vicco showing cowboy serials ever Saturday  night. Me and Paul Hignight, my good buddy, walked  down the railroad tracks come Saturday afternoons. We'd  walk a couple of miles and cross down to the road just  before them tracks went winding off to the east. We'd pick  up loose spikes and stick them in our pockets so our  nickels would chingle against them. Me and Paul felt  mighty rich with fifty cents chingling against them spikes,  and my pockets always felt heavy so's I had the feeling I  was sure enough well-off even when there weren't no  change to chingle. We was youngens together...me and  Paul. I remember there was sunshine then in  Whiteblossom. It seemed to bust you all to pieces in the  summer times when you walked out of them mines. Course in the winter we had to go down in the hole 'fore  daylight and didn't get out till after dark. It made me feel  good, you know, back inside that mountain, knowing that  sun was shining on Whiteblossom. Course all the houses in  the camp was full then...not like it is now, all empty and  falling apart. Guess it ain't going to be the same in this  part of Kentucky again. Well, times change...   Old Man Barger used to live up the hill just past the  church. Had him a fine house he'd built. Dug a hole back  in that hill and just kept hammering in the wood till he  could stand out on his porch sucking on that funny-  looking pipe he'd whittled. He could look out over all of  Whiteblossom from that porch.   When I was a youngen I used to walk up past his place  to get to the top. Fine hunting back in them woods. Course  by the time you'd climbed up there you was ready to catch  your breath.   Like I was saying...Old Man Barger would be standing on that porch of his sucking that pipe, his hands  hooked in his back jpockets. He looked mighty satisfied,  all peaceful and content like, standing looking out over  Whiteblossom. I'd say, 'How you all, Mr. Barger,' and  he'd 'How you all' me right back, and then say 'Catch a fat  one fer me.' It made me feel real good to hear him say  that, knowing he was wishing me good hunting. That was  important...seeing as how the only meat we 'et was  brought home from the hunting. Hell, them was hard  times, but I don't remember hearing no complaints from  my pappy and ma. They wanted us youngens   all nine  of us   to know we was loved. We was poor, but so was  everybody else, and it didn't seem to make no difference. I  guess these young folks leaving the camps today ain't got  no use for being poor. Who's to blame them. No, it ain't  easy, but evertime I see somebody packing up his things  and heading out, it almost makes me want to cry watching  the dirt from their tires being flung back on  Whiteblossom. It's mighty disheartening. Well, we was  poor and Paul's folks was poor.   Me and Paul worked hard, and we was 'bout as  foolish as two boys can be. We was seventeen when we  took two girls to the picture show down in Vicco. I'd saved  fer a couple of weeks to have the change fer the show and  a soda after. It was big time dating Vicco girls. Usually  me and Paul just stood around on the church porch up in  Whiteblossom and walked girls home. Well, me and Paul  walked into that movie house like we was rich men stepping out with queens. After we walked by the popcorn  machine Paul's girl says,  Hmmm that popcorn sure did  smell good.' So Paul does a turn-around and says just as  polite as you please, 'It sure did, honey, let's go back and  git ourselves another smell.' Well, he was a funny one and  I laughed at him till I cried. Folks these days don't think  it's no fun being poor...maybe they're right...but I 'member it weren't all so sad and downhearted.   Well, that happened a while before Old Man Barger  moved off the mountain, but I 'member it like yesterday.  When you stood up there next to that old man it seemed  like you could touch the clouds they hung so low, and  everything smelt sweeter from up there. You could see  most everything going on in Whiteblossom. In them days  that road running by the foot of the mountain was busy,  and the house was newer. Well, they weren't much, but  they was full and you could see people moving around  down in Whiteblossom. In them days the coal was hauled  out by trains. I guess you'd never even see them old tracks  right back of the drygoods store if'n you didn't know they  was there. Now-a-days they just carry out the loads on  trucks. I guess the mines are giving out like they say.  Most of them got big slabs of lumber nailed across the  front anyways. Sometimes when I'm out hunting, I come  across some old mine I clean forgot about. It's kind of  scary looking at it all nailed up, like maybe it was a tomb.  I worked a sight of them old mines and sometimes I feel  like most of me is shut away too. Now ain't that the dar-  nest thing you ever heard  Well, my finger's laying in one  of them mines, so maybe it ain't so silly.   I recollect Old Man Barger moved off the mountain  when he got hurt in the mines twenty years ago. Seems  like he never could make it back up the hill too good after  that, but I do recollect seeing him standing up there on  that porch once in a while a long time after he moved  down to the bottom. That old house just fell away seeing as  how he wouldn't sell it to nobody. His boy, the youngest  one, Davey, growed up and built him a house right next to  his daddy down at the bottom of that mountain. Davey  always put me to mind of Paul for some reason. I guess it  were them both being dark and wild. Well, Davey was  wild till he got married. Mabel said it was the saddest  thing, watching Davey, him a big, grown man, leaning on  the side of that mountain out back of his house crying  while his little boy was laid out in the front room.   Davey works in the mines now and again when they  send out a call, but mostly he works across the road in  front of his house on a couple of junk cars. I walked by  many times and see'd his youngens squatting out there  beside him fooling with his wiping rags all covered with  oil. Them youngens always seemed 'bout half-naked and  Mabel said they went next door to Granny Barger's to eat.  Their momma ain't but nineteen or twenty now   her  being married at fourteen   and don't cook too good, but  them youngens is loved. That I know. They was always  polite little things and said, 'How you all,' just like big  folks when I walked by. Ever last one of them would be  covered in coal dust and car oil. There was four of them  and one in the oven.   Mabel said she was walking up toward my place the  day she see'd that oldest boy git burned up. Said she was  standing on that hump in the road just before it levels out  past the Bargers. Said there was a screaming and that boy  of Davey's come running out to the middle of the road.  Said he was on fire. Said he didn't look or sound like no  human. Said she took off running toward him but his  Granny Barger reached him first. Said his Granny kept  beating out those flames and pushed the youngen to the  ground and kept beating out those flames with her hands.  Said that youngen's momma stood on the porch  screaming and holding her swollen belly and screaming.  Said Mrs. Barger kept calling for the Lord and kept  beating out those flames till there weren't no more sound  on the black road. Said it weren't something she'd ever be  able to forget.   Well, Davey had finally got one of them old cars  working and was running it up and down the road when his  boy catched fire. The Lord provides, that he does, and  Davey carried that youngen and Mrs. Barger down here  in his old junk car, blowing the horn for two hours on the  way. Mabel said she held that youngen's head in her lap  and what she 'members most is hearing that horn blow all  the way to Hazard while Mrs. Barger prayed. Said that  baby stayed awake most of the time even though his body  was all black up to his neck. Said he kept opening his eyes  Page 5  and holding up his hand and showing it to her. She said his  little finger was nothing but bone. Said that little youngen  kept looking at that finger like it was the strangest thing  he'd ever saw and he wanted her to see it too.   Well, that youngen of Davey's kept looking at his  little finger. Mabel said they got to Hazard and brought  him in here, but one of them other doctors had him hauled  off to Louisville in an ambulance. Mabel stayed on with  Mrs. Barger. That nurse who bandaged Mrs. Barger's  hands was so mixed-up after looking at the youngen, she  done the bandaging all...Mabel said that nurse just wrapped Mrs. Barger's hands all together. Said Mrs. Barger  didn't utter one sound 'bout the hurting. Said they had to  cut her fingers apart yesterday and bandaged them again.  Said they'd growed together that fast.   Davey went on down to Louisville and never left his  youngen's side more than a minute for three days. Mabel  heard he wouldn't touch a bite. That youngen's momma  just took to her bed and ain't moved since. They brung the  boy back  home two days ago, but he weren't knowing  about it. They put him in one of those fancy pine boxes  down in Louisville and sent him back to Whiteblossom.  Mabel got things going in the camp and people come for  miles around bringing in cooking. Mabel said she ain't  seen so many folks in the camp for twenty years..not since  Paul passed on. The Barger youngens come back home  from as far away as Dayton, Ohio. Said that house of  Davey's was just busting with people the whole two days  that boy laid in his momma's front room. Said them folks  would sit around crying and talking real low, then they'd  mosey out to the kitchen to eat a bite, laugh a bit together  over something that was going down in Vicco. Said it  eased the pain a little to mosey out there and eat a bite.  That oldest girl of Davey's would run out to the porch evertime somebody else come and say, 'How you all,' and  tell them her brother had burned up and they's all welcome to the food in the kitchen. Well, she's just five. Mabel  said somebody told her that little girl had set fire to her  brother and Mabel shushed them up right fast. Well, those  youngens was playing and I don't reckon what happened  can be blamed on anybody.   Mabel said there was that child laying in that fancy  pine box. Said they done a fine job down in Louisville and  weren't nothing you could tell 'ceptin' maybe he was a little dark under his chin. Said he looked real natural laying  there. Said Mrs. Barger kept going over to his box and  patting that sweet face with her white-bandaged hands.  Mrs. Barger kept saying, 'Thank you Jesus,' seeing as  how that youngen was burned clean through and would  have been in misery if he'd lived. Mabel said his little man  thing was burned off. Said he wouldn't ever been no man  had he lived. Well, the Lord sees all these things...it was  merciful he took the youngen on to heaven.   Mabel said when she see'd Davey out back hitting that  mountain she just broke down herself. Somebody said  Davey's youngen told his daddy to make those two black  boogie-men git away from his bed down there in  Louisville. Said Davey told him, 'Honey, there ain't no  boogie-men,' but the youngen kept saying there was. That  baby kept waking up saying that for three whole days.  Well, it ain't easy to figure something like that out, or  forget it. Maybe it was all that medicine them doctors  kept giving him.   Mabel said Old Man Barger got a preacher from Vicco  to come say the words since our preacher moved on three  years ago. Well, there ain't many people left to save in  Whiteblossom anymore. Said that preacher spoke some  mighty inspiring words. Said it made a body feel good  looking forward to the time when we'll all see Jesus. Said  they took Davey's youngen up on the mountain and buried  him in the woods back of the old Barger place next to  where we buried Paul. Mabel said she looked down in the  camp and it was a misery to see Whiteblossom all empty  and hollow like those eyes of Paul's when he was laying  there in my arms at the end.   Well, Doc, I'm carrying on, but Mabel just left and I  got to thinking. This black lung has me way down and I  couldn't seem to get up the strength to pay my respects at  the burying. Mabel paid them for me and begged pardon I  couldn't come. She said the burying was right proper, and  if ever a youngen looked like an angel on its way to see  Jesus, it was that one of Davey's. Well, it made me mournful, and I laid here bawling like somebody touched in the  head. Mabel said was you going to let me come home soon.  I said I wouldn't be knowing it when you did, and I  reckoned I wouldn't be missing the next burying in  Whiteblossom. Then Mabel started in bawling and said,  'Oh Cass, I hate to see you go.'

        <pagetext>Page 6  WOMANKIND  You Know This One's  For You, Honey.  When intrigue filled Olympus' atmosphere  And when the Court of Love ruled Avignon,  I loved you. As of then, I love you now  And I shall love you, need you, hold you fast  In the dim reach of future, as in past.  No passing fancy, this, my chosen one.  My passions remain constant and my vow  Will echo through all ages in your ear.  MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  POEMS FOR MY SISTER  KNOWING THERE WILL BE TIME  There is a road  my sister has not taken.  She plays no game of   making a U-turn.   It is a one-way street  she will take at her own speed  well aware the road will turn for her  as for us all.  She has shown me beauties  I would have missed  and we have laughed  knowing there will be time  before the parting.  I MUST DANCE FOR HER  Hail Marys  singsong, humming  words through her heart,  in Spanish she said  la hora de mue rte :  having pushed the hour bravely away  refused to invite it  in english.  I must dance for her my prayer  knowing her strong right side  even then would not have served  to dance the other:  walking was hard enough.  Whatever she has done  friendship  painting  mothering  being a sister  has had that evolving dance  that well aware dark glance  living out the exquisite mocking prance  of the one who taught us  psalms,  honesty  and prayers.  Do you see me dancing?  Both of you?  DEATH  If she could say it to me  she'll say it to you,  that little spitfire sister  to my browbeating:   I just perkeffly hate you    And you and I, well knowing  the justice on her side  will quit, disgruntled  aggrieved at her rejection  biding time.  And let me warn you, Death,  there is gut power in that sister,  staying power  that will not be content with your destruction.  When she decides to win you,  not destroy you  the embrace she takes you with  will change you  forever.  THEN where will you be,  Death?  ANITA SPEER SMITH  Haiku  Fair weeping willow,  Secret leafy hiding place,  Near a lily pad.  GLORIA JONES  Open Fire Quartet  I. Mother  Conceived, as I was, in a woman's acrid womb,  I fought for 12 hours against October's light,  Then, I saw white.  But did I cry, I wonder?  Out, loud, I mean?  Long nights later, I stared the gloom  In a suburb's room,  Before it became fashionable     A near-miss at country living-  Bypassed playmates, lost a sister to my rival's  greater need,  And a child-aunt's company to her envy.  Now, past 30,1 clearly see  I was never my father's girl,  but rather Mother's daughter,   Expecting love from no man,  as they say.  Just from every one.  Old robots and burning truths regularly recycled,  I thought I'd changed.  And perhaps I had...  Except to conquer fear.  Today, out of the coldest, longest winter of my life,  Spring called me,  bringing sunshine and the promise of a softer summer.  Tempted, once again, to the easy womb I'd never known.  I turned  To run.  But insight foiled relief.  Having bit the bullet,  I'm not turning back.  Nothing grieves like grief.  And winning might be fun.  II  Father  (Originally  Metathesis,  written 3/2/76)  ***  Stuffing myself (food or grief, it didn't matter),  until the buttons popped, zippers burst, and  heart broke,  I must have hinted to a hundred guys to hold me fast...  Only don't crush any wings.   Papa... , Daddy...  How I must have cried, that cold, wet, winter's night,  Such a bitchy, little girl, trying to hold tight.  Traumatized, then quickly tamed,  I set to prove I didn't care,  Did all those things for MY sake,  Never yours.  Until a phone call, and waiting in the car that rainy eve  for news of you,  Our confrontation of the time before accounted for,  But never counted,  'Til today.  Torrents of guileless guilt.  Can't you feel the love I'm sending, unending,  -overflowing your hot, fat lap?  How could you write the piece you wrote  without note of knowing me?  Fearful of (the non-) restraint,  No matter how I loved you,  I/you/we/they/he/she did not approve.  Now, an aunt,  By virtue of your son's transgression,  I want to bind it all  In a package  For  that kid,   Wrapped with bright red ribbon...  Mike...  (So many named Michael )  Blood or symbol, doesn't matter,  Just want it done,  Unknown to all but one and a couple of  competent functionaries.  My grotesquely plump arms tire of grabbing  an empty chest.  Ah, D., You gave me back that awe-full pain of love...  Ironic, now, you'll watch me grow and share with all,  But first, and for the longest day,  YourSelf.  The limbs of God are not fleshy,  But brittle, firm and warm...  A southwest wind blowing across the heartstrings,  Yesterday...  Lifting me higher...soaring.. .flying...  Until I join my soul in some free-fall,  Once and again to know  Our sweet,  dark,  dreams.  III. God  He promised me the world;  Then gave me back my self.  not such a bad deal after all...  Only a little painful.  IV. Country  FREEDOM   Shot out of a red hot cannon,  straight-arrow,  All the long, long way from one shore to the other;  Dust-covered wagon, first pulled, then pushed,  coast-to-coast but always in a pink-gold  cinematographer's dream...  I love you.  Snows melting into rivulets of sweat,  dumped downstream to plague our own, first,  and then, all the smaller/weaker of the world,  who might have something...  We could want?  One day, near sated, we abated,  lifted our heads from dinner  To confront our image in a billion colored dots,  Of cold and hots,  Nevermore to know a verdant  Why?  Searching madly through the past, we wound up  in a Chinaperson's pocket,  Looking for a locket  of someone's unkempt hair,  Discovered  truth  in a Buck-Ninety-Five  Bantam paperback, on...  You name it   Uh,uh...  No one's gonna twist my arrow into any   3  or  8.   Love too easily reads hate,  And I, like all my  infant countrymen,  Am waiting for my own brand of crazy  To loop the loop,  and catch my from behind,  Capture my mind,  With a new Americano Manifesto,  scribbled on a paper napkin from MacDonald's  or a voucher from Sinclair...  Freedom...  Where you there?  No, not two hundred years ago...  but last week, and the week before,  To lock and bar the door  Against an awesome future.  Fear and Guilt...  A Bloody Past...  How long could that last?  God damn it, Isadora, Walt...  Where are you now that we DON'T need you?  LAURA ANN MILLER

At the controls were CAPTAIN  CAROLINE FROST and her co-pilot, ANN HARDY. In  addition to the two female pilots, there were two stewardesses   the first all-woman crew to land in West  Germany.  MEXICO   The Mexican Constitution (of 1917) is  BEING REWORDED TO INCLUDE WOMEN under its  protection and Congress is changing several laws that  discriminate against women. Congress' aim is to grant  legal equality in the home, at work and in school.  The Constitution will now include the concept that   everyone shall be equal before the law.  Also included  is the statement that  everyone shall have the right to  determine the number and timing of their children in a  free, responsible and informed fashion.   info from WHAT SHE WANTS  NEW YORK   In an out-of-court settlement for a sex  discrimination case instigated in 1973, the READER'S  DIGEST has agreed to pay  1.5 million to 2,600 women  employees and former employees. The bulk of the  money will be used for compensatory back pay; 142 wo   men currently employed by the magazine will receive  immediate salary increases.

Mercouri, 52, was  elected as a standard-bearer of the leftwing Panhellenic  Socialist Movement.  My supporters didn't consider me  a star,  boasted Mercouri.  They saw me as a woman  who has made a long march.  Mercouri vows to make  women's rights her primary concern.  I can be the  women's voice of protest in Parliament,  she declares.

English Women Reclaim The Night  ENGLAND   On November 12, 1977, women marched  through the city streets throughout England to   Reclaim the Night    to protest the dangers of rape and  attack that deny women free access to the streets.  Singing, chanting, bearing torches and banners, 500  women marched through Soho, London, center of the  porn trade and sexual exploitation. Some of the male  bystanders spat at the demonstrators, or tried to grab individuals out of the procession. However, this possibility  had been taken into account in the planning stages of the  march, and these men were sprayed with red dye. The  marches were exhilarating events with women singing  songs about their struggles and plastering stickers on  sexist advertisements and establishments.         info from PEOPLES NEWS SERVICE  Free Newsletter Available  WOMEN'S STUDIES IN INDIANA is a FREE  newsletter that provides much local, state, and national  information.

FILM REVIEW  Julia  Fred Zinneman's new film JULIA has been variously  hailed as the film of the year, the quintessential  woman's film, and a number of other things. It has had  so much of this kind of publicity, in fact, that is has very  nearly achieved the dubious status of one of those tearoom style restaurants where women congregate enthusiastically at midday, but have to prod and coax their  husbands to visit in the evening hours. It is unfortunate  that so fine a film has gained this reputation and will be  as eagerly boycotted by men as it is attended by women.  JULIA is not merely a film about women, but a film  about friendship   deep, personal, moving, and extraordinarily meaningful. Rather, the film has the great  potential of portraying this kind of friendship.  JULIA comes very close to being a great film by  all standards. It misses the mark by so little, that  we can only regret what is missing, what flaws it  displays. We are tempted to think that if only this or that  had been a little different it would indeed be a truly  satisfying work of art. It occurs to the viewer that  perhaps in the hands of Truffaut or Bertolucci, JULIA  would have been transformed into a cinematic masterpiece. The film is  beautiful  in so many senses of the  word. From the point of view of pure technical virtuosity, JULIA succeeds; it is a slighlty amber-tinted  and luminescent work that pictures life as a glowing  and precious thing. At the mere level of surface reality,  the film is wonderful. It is in the prodding of this reality  that it fails. As we all know, great art, even reasonably  good art, shows a great more than it tells. Unfortunately, JULIA attempts to tell too much. The constant  flow of words accompanying every scene crowds out the  vision, trivializes the real meaning of the film.  The plot of the film seems sound enough. However,  working with a piece of writing that confuses the genres  of fiction with autobiography is always a dangerous endeavor. Both Hellman and Zinneman have chosen to  skate on thin ice in this respect. Where are the lines to be  drawn? Who was Julia? Under what circumstances did  the very young Lillian Hellman meet this extraordinary  girl? Were they social equals? The plot can easily be  outlined.  A very, very rich girl realizes very, very early in her  life that something is seriously amiss in the world: the  distribution of wealth is wholly disproportionate. Her  vision of this situation cannot reconcile her grandparents'  opulence (that dictates the eating of lemon sherbet  between the fish and meat courses to  clear the palate )  with the starving and sick people on the streets of Cairo.  Of course, if she were not fortunate enough to visit Cairo  in the first place, we wonder how long it would have  taken her to reach this conclusion.  This reflective and extraordinary adolescent matures  into an extraordinarily clear-headed woman who thrives  on Hegel, Darwin, Marx, and Freud. When Lillian asks  her if she can understand Einstein, Julia replies,  Of  course.   The predicament of the intellectual woman in the  early decades of the twentieth century was a confusing  one to be certain. This reminds us of Gertude Stein's attempt to earn a degree in medicine at the turn-of-the-  century John Hopkins. When prodded by her female  friends who encouraged her to finish her medical studies  because of what it would mean to all women, Miss Stein  replied,  You do not know what it means to be bored.   Gertrude Stein, of course, chose the option of the literary  life, and we can all be grateful for that choice.  Julia interrupts her medical studies to join a militant  anti-Fascist group in Vienna. Vanessa Redgrave's  pale but burning eyes convey not just commitment but  the essence of what it means to be committed. We wonder if Miss Redgrave's own Trotskeyite commitments  contribute in any way towards her capacity for this kind  of authentic acting.  When Julia requests that Lillian carry fifty thousand  dollars from Paris to Berlin, Lillian can only remember  Julia's superior strength and courage as a child and as a  young woman. Lillian cannot refuse even though  Mr.  Johann,  the emissary who conveys the request, explains that Julia will certainly understand if Lillian  refuses (he warns that Julia is aware that Lillian is  afraid of being afraid).  Integrity bolstered by memory compels her to carry  the funds although she is aware of the circumstances.  Here, the question to ask is how heroic is an act if the  agent is not fully aware of the risks; at this point, Lillian  seems aloof from the Fascist threat. This sequence,  the trip from Paris to Berlin, should be the most interesting part of the film, yet something is absent or  perhaps too much is present. The trip seems to take  weeks. Jane Fonda's performance is superb; beads of  sweat literally cover her face as she sits in the coach  wondering what moves will betray her mission. This  part of the film is not exactly melodramatic, but it does  not have far to go to achieve this.  The final meeting between Julia and Lillian takes  place in a typical railway station restaurant, the Cafe  Albert in Berlin. Julia has had a leg amputated as a  result of a skirmish with the Fascists in Vienna; Lillian  is in tears at the discovery of this loss. Julia telescopes  years into a brief conversation: she tells Lillian that she  has had a baby. Probably the most poignant moment of  the film, one guaranteed to bring tears to the most  stoical countenance, is Julia's reply to the question,   What is the baby's name?  Julia simply replies   Lilly.  That is the moment that clinches what this incredible friendship has meant. Lillian dissolves and we  dissolve along with her.  It is difficult for moviegoers to separate Jane Fonda  from the character of Lillian Hellman and Vanessa  Redgrave from Julia. The reason for this is our previous  knowledge that both these women, in what we call real  life, are committed individuals, socially and politically.  If the parts were played by unknown actresses, the difficulty of separating the two would not exist. We can only  wonder how much of Jane Fonda gets mixed up with  Lillian Hellman, a woman that Fonda admits to admire  a great deal. Vanessa Redgrave's performance is stunning, superb, compelling. We only wish that we could see  more and more of her on the screen. This is probably the  flaw in the film, although we are aware throughout that  the story is being told by Lillian and, therefore, we can  have no privileged access to Julia except what we gain  through the encounters between the girls/women.  So, we ask the question, how reliable is the  narrator? Perhaps the first person point of view intrudes  too much by presenting a superfluity of details about  Lillian Hellman's life while ignoring some rather  significant aspects of Julia's growth and development.  Omniscient narration may Ivave been a better choice  although it would represent a serious distortion of the  Story from PENTIMENTO:  It is finally regrettable that Zinnemann has attempted  to make this film palatable to everyone. The suburban  housewife will have renewed commitment to her volunteer work, the nurse will tend her patients with renewed  vigor and zeal, young girls will want to grow up to lead   meaningful  lives and to establish intimate friendships. There is, of course, nothing wrong with this or  with these kinds of objectives, but I resent the fact that  something noble has been sacrificed in the name of  popular interest.  JULIA is a glowing, admirable example of what it  means to lead a life that is centered around a deep commitment. This is, in existential thought, what separates  authentic man and woman from inauthentic man and  woman. Sartre would approve. Simone de Beauvoir  would approve. The question is, quite simply, can we  approve of a supposed work of art that force-feeds doctrine? Would it not be better to show things in a less  biased light? The message would still come through, but  we would not feel that we had been forced to a stark  realization that life is meaningless when we lack true  goals, true commitment. Lillian Hellman presumably  experienced a genuine epiphany after Julia's death and  gained the strength to take a stand against Fascism.  We know, for certain, that Hellman wishes to be  recognized as a staunch defender of liberty for all and  as   an  opponent  to   the  bitter  poison  of  Fascism  Perhaps the flaw of JULIA is untimeliness; there is  too much crossing between art and life here. It is a film,  finally, that is best appreciated when regarded as a  poignant, wholly arresting, and extremely moving account of what it means to know friendship. We all wish  that we could experience such contact with another  human being.  RITA M.ROSS  Even with its flaws (and they are few), JULIA is a  movie that is well worth seeing. The editors recommend  it. JULIA is a rare and sensitive film. Don't miss it. Take  a friend, relative, lover, husband, etc., to see it with you.  Male or female   it doesn't matter if s/he is a sensitive  human beings s/he will appreciate JULIA.  Lillian Hellman June 20,1905     Playwright and author

        <pagetext>Page 8  i  iM tte      Irenige Inrt  by PAT HEIDENREICH  A Mother's Nightmare...  I had a really rotten dream recently. It still haunts me.  The darn thing seemed so real. I remember it started  with me having a whopper of an argument with my 13-  year-old.   Now I'm telling you for the last time,  I shrieked,   you better shape up if you know what's good for you     Well, that does it,  he said calmly.  Mother, I hate to  do this, but some day you'll understand. You're grounded  For one week  And not just grounded to the house,  but grounded to your room ''   Grounded?  I wailed.  Why?    For using that tone of voice to me. I just won't have  it. I've warned you before and you just didn't listen. Now  you'll have to accept the punishment,  he said matter-  of-factly.   But I have a job. I have to go to the office. I have  plans made and appointments to keep,  I cried.   You should've thought of that before. And if you keep  up this fuss, I'll also take away your phone privileges.    I'm gonna tell Dad how unfair you are,  I  threatened, stomping toward my bedroom.   Alright, just for that, you're grounded for two  weeks     I don't care   I screamed, running into the bedroom  and slamming the door behind me. I threw myself on the  bed and sobbed loudly. No one understands me, I  thought. I contemplated running away. I was still crying  when Roquespiere came in.  I poured out everything.  I got grounded,  I sniffed,  wiping the tears,  and it's just not fair.    Your son already explained the situation to me. I know  it's hard for you to understand, my dear, but.the child is  right. You have been getting awfully mouthy lately. It  seems it will take something drastic to make you learn  to keep a civil tongue in your head and treat your  children with some respect.   I couldn't believe Roques was against me too.  But  what am I going to tell my boss?  I wailed with newly  rising sobs.   You'll just have to tell the truth and explain that  you're being punished. By the way, I received a call  from the school today. It seems they have some complaints on your behavior.    On MY behavior. I didn't do anything     Yes, that's just the trouble. One teacher reported  that our daughter came to school in clothes that were  quite wrinkled, our oldest son had two buttons missing  on the shirt he wore, and the little one's teacher reported  that a shampoo was definitely in order. Not only that,  but it seems you neglected to do as you were told and  send two dozen cookies last Thursday for the recital  refreshments. I hate to lecture you, but it is quite an embarrassment for me to receive this kind of a report.  Motherhood does bring certain responsibilities and  duties, you know, and it's high time you began fulfilling  yours properly.   I sat dejectedly on the edge of the bed, my head bowed.   Just one more thing,  he added before departing for  the living room.  I entered our house as a candidate for  the company's Tour of Homes and the judges will be  here in the morning to inspect. They will decide if the  place meets all requirements and qualifications.   ....it was at that point I woke up. I was drenched in  perspiration and was shaking violently. I jumped out of  bed in panic and began working frantically. I must've  looked like an octopus scurrying around with a dust rage  and the Pledge in one hand, the vacuum in the other and  the Comet tucked under my left armpit. It was 3 a.m. and  I had the bathroom, the front closet and the kitchen all  cleaned before it hit me...the whole thing has just been a  mother's nightmare.

To save you some money and maybe some time, here  are ten suggestions that have helped me most:  First: when someone (be it boss, child or spouse) is  haranguing you, listing all your faults since year one,  just picture that person as an animal and think how  marvelous it is that that donkey or goat or parrot or  sheep can talk. If you can't picture an animal, try  visualizing transparent overlays, putting various  costumes on this person like pajper doll clothes until  something fits. My favorite is Roddy MacDowell in full  dress from Planet of the Apes.  Second: get a thorough checkup to rule out such  gloom-producers as low blood sugar, hypothyroidism,  mononeucleuosis, vitamin or mineral deficiency.  Third: when you have a disliked chore to accomplish,  set a timer to ring in 30 minutes. 1 can clean two toilets  and a hamster cage in less than that, which gives me  enough time to mix a Manhattan.  Fourth: reward yourself for jobs well done. Indulge in  whatever you have missed the most as you've been  floundering around   a professional facial? A long  luxurious bubble bath? A nosegay of flowers? Whatever  turns you on.  Fifth: imagine yourself wearing a sweatshirt with  printed motto. Mine used to say,  WIPE FEET HERE,   now it says,  DON'T TREAD ON ME.  What does yours  say? What would you like it to say?  Sixth: when you're really way down and can't hibernate until spring, scream. I have found the best time  and place to do this is while driving the car. I can head  for the meeting I'd prefer to skip or even just drive  around the block with the windows rolled up and scream  myself hoarse. I also sing all the dirty ditties I can  remember. After ventilating hostility this way, it's a lot  easier to be cordial with associates and patient with my  family. You can scream into a pillow, but it's not that  satisfying.  Seventh: if you're apprehensive about something, or  have a phobia that's inconvenient, ask yourself,  What  is the worst that can happen?  Picture the worst in  living color in your head; get right into the scene and  suddenly it's not so scary. Fears are like Hallowe'en  goblins: if you turn around and say  Boo   they disappear.  Eight: eliminate all the irritants you can. If your  teenager's stereo is horendous, buy him a set of headphones   why should both of you go deaf? If you've been  putting off doing something promised, do it now and get  it over with. If you're a toothpaste-tube-winder and your  husband is a middle-squeezer, live a little: buy separate  tubes.  Ninth: try honesty. You don't have to be brutal, but  tell the person bugging you how you feel. For example,  you could say,  When you talk about my being lost when  I was five, my stomach still gets tied into a knot.  Or,   When you insist on having the stereo that loud, I get a  screaming headache.   Tenth: when you can't change circumstances, change  yourself. All it takes is one little move, one small change  in your daily routine, your outlook on others, your  feeling about yourself and you find you are able to cope.  So if you're not in clover yet, at least you're out of the  briar patch.  Ideas are healthier than tranquilizers, try them. They  work.

        <pagetext>Page 10  IWY  (Continued from Page 2)  THE 20 PER CENT WHO OPPOSED most of the plan,  including 31 of 32 Indiana delegates,  looked rather  glum throughout the whole Conference,  said Pat Miller  Kane, a Hoosier high school teacher.  Sen. Joan Gubbins of Indiana, the Hoosier delegation's  leader and Floor Leader of one of the conservative factions attending the IWY   Pro-Family, Pro-Life   said  the convention was  rigged . She charged feminists had  mad-3 no attempt to listen to the minority faction who  claimed to represent the  real majority  of the nation's  women. She said conference planners did not allow  enough time to talk about resolutions and  never did intend to plan enough time.    I know   internally   how hard we worked to balance  view points,  said Ruth C. Clusen, member of the IWY  Commission and President of the National League of  Women Voters.   We deviated from normal procedures to provide opportunity for them to talk. They had equal access to the  press and to lobby delegates,  she said.   We opposed the majority of things but we voted for  the credit resolution,  said Delegate Alice B. Buechler,  homemaker and registered nurse from Ft. Wayne. The  credit resolution was the only Conference plank that  passed unanimously.   WE DIDN'T VOTE AGAINST the resolutions for  reasons assumed. Our biggest objection to almost all of  the resolutions is almost every one says 'the President  or Congress shall...' and we oppose the federal government having complete power. The power should be in  the hands of local elected officials.  Beuchler also said  the Indiana delegation did not consist of members of the  KKK, the John Birch Society or the Communist Party.  Another Hoosier delegate, Mary E. Inderlied, author  and homemaker from Bippis, said  The entire program  is Socialism and the federal government can't keep  house now.   Hoosier delegate Sandy Houlihan, homemaker and  music teacher of Ossian, said alternate viewpoints had  not been allowed on the floor.  Phyllis Schlafly, President of Stop-ERA and founder  of anti-feminist group Eagle Forum, predicted the  demise of the women's movement would occur in  Houston. Though Schlafly was not an official delegate,  she did head the  Stop ERA forces once they were off the  floor. Schlafly said the IWY Conferences  serve as a  front to give media exposure and respectability to  radicals, lesbians and misfits who want to agitate for  their anti-family goals at the taxpayers' expense.    I think the Chairs have done a good job of maintaining order,  said Suzanne Mann Rohde, consumer  advocate from South Bend.  They've tried to be fair to  everyone but when procedural rules are not followed,  microphones are immediately cut off. It's about the  only way to deal with such a large group,  she said.  Rohde, an Official Observer, attended the Conference,  at her own expense.  Minority  groups  said  the  IWY  was  handled  to    deliberately  exclude people with traditional  family  views. Some claimed the Commission had purposely  raised sentiment against them. They planned substitute  resolutions but were unable to get any passed.   THE MEMBERS OF THE International Women's  Year Commission would like to make clear and public  our concern over the unrepresentative composition of  several state delegations; a result of apparent right-  wing control that contradicts the spirit of the law calling  for a delegate balance at the National Conference according to racial, ethnic, religious and age and income  groups,  said a prepared statement from the commission. They noted the all-white delegation, five of  whom were men, of Mississippi, a state whose  population is 36.8 per cent black.  George Higgins, Jr., self-identified in newspaper  reports as  Grand Dragon of the Realm of Mississippi,  United Klans of America, Inc., Knights of the Ku Klux  Klan,  is quoted as saying, in regard to the IWY Conference, ''We controlled the one in Mississippi. '  The Commission recorded their  outrage on the basis  of fairness to the citizens of particular states that their  delegations, regardless of any question of viewpoint, do  not represent the true demographic balance of those  states.   Taxi drivers, hotel workers and veteran conference-  goers were impressed with the dignity with which the  women handled themselves and by the women's interest  and participation in the conference.   THIS CONFERENCE REFLECTS the women of this  country...and offers an opportunity for the sharing of  Elective and Appointive Office, Employment, Offenders,  Heckler from Massachusetts, a Commission member.   It is not a melting pot; it is a potpourri,  she said.   The conference has given new depth of meaning to  the phrase 'I am my sister's helper,'  said Dr. Marjorie  Bell Chambers, President of the American Association  of University Women.   Those in attendance felt compassion for each other's  problems. Women put aside their differences to support  each other and to move forward on a national Plan of Action,  said Chambers.   The majority realized that to deny the civil rights of  any one woman is to deny the civil rights of all,  she  said.  AT ALL TIMES THROUGHOUT the Conference, two  people, one on either side of the stage set-up, acted as interpreters, signing the IWY proceedings to deaf participants. The Conference took care to try and include  the handicapped in this way and in other similar ways.  A wide range of opinion on the proposed IWY  resolutions was apparent at the Conference. Most  resolutions were passed unchanged, by alphabetical order. These included Arts and Humanities, Battered  Women, Business, Child Care, Credit (unanimous),  Elective and Appointive Office, Employment, offenders.  Equal  itights Amendment, Sexual Preference, and  Statistics.  The Indiana delegation abstained from voting on Child  Abuse, Battered Women and Business resolutions, all of  which passed. They said the Chair would not let them  WOMANKIND  debate so they would not vote. They had been cut off in  debate when the question was called.   It has become increasingly evident to governments  as well as individuals that no country can afford to  ignore the abilities and skills of half of its population,   said Helvi Sipila, United Nations Assistant Secretary-  General.  ACCORDING TO JUDY CARTER, White House Coordinator for ratification of the ERA and daughter-in-law  of the President, the ERA would not affect rights to  privacy, abortion laws, conscription powers of  Congress, social and religious practices and laws regarding homosexuals. Rights given under labor laws, social  security, and divorce laws would be extended to include  everyone.   I believe that the most important vote that can come  from this National Women's Conference is a resounding  affirmation of our united determination to become part  of the legal processes of this country,  she said.   Let us make it clear to the people of our country that  a vote for ERA is a vote for a better life with greater opportunities for all our citizens,  Carter said.  These remarks were voiced throughout the Conference up until the amendment received its strong endorsement. Right before the vote was taken most delegates  stood and the Sam Houston Coliseum thundered with the  reverberated voices chanting  ERA ERA ERA  in  unison. After the passage women wept, laughed, hugged  and threw themselves into each other's arms. The  Florida delegation held up bras and signs that said  We  didn't burn 'em.  Many people waved ERA signs back  and forth through the air. The Chair was not immediately successful in restoring the exuberant Conference to order. The Equal Rights Amendment was  passed with much enthusiasm. It was an unforgettable  experience.  'A country that can put men on the moon can put  women in the Constitution,  said Rep. Heckler.  BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF THE ERA endorsement, ERAmerica, the nationwide alliance of 130  organizations working for ratification of the ERA, sponsored a fundraiser and netted  50,000. Many were turned away at the door of the Hyatt Regency ballroom  which held a standing-room-only crowd of enthusiasts.  Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford, honorary chairs of the  benefit, endorsed the ERA. ERAmerica co-chairs Liz  Carpenter and Elly Peterson spoke at the affair along  with Abzug, Judy Carter, Jill Ruckelshaus, first  presiding officer of the IWY Commission; Midge  Costanza, Special Assistant to the President and  feminist author Betty Friedan, among others. Many  distinguished guests were in attendance.  Besides the resolution to endorse the ERA, another  key issue was the Sexual Preference amendment. In an  emotional appeal Feminist Betty Friedan said,  I have  had trouble with this issue.  She went on to say that this  issue had divided the women's movement for too long  and that  We should help the lesbians be protected by  their civil rights.  The resolution was passed much to  the delight of cheering gay rights advocates. Colorful  balloons were released into the air all over the coliseum.  The balloons said,  We are everywhere.   Commissioner Jean O'Leary, Co-executive Director of  the National Gay Task Force, said gays appreciated  Friedan's apology and  It's happening to many, many  people.   Other resolutions passed at the IWY included Child  Abuse, a susbstitute resolution on Disabled Women, ah  Education resolution with two amendments added,  Health, Homemakers, Insurance, International Affairs,  Media, a substitute Minority Women resolution, a substitute Older Women resolution, an amended Rape  resolution, Reproductive Freedom, Rural Women, and a  substitute Women, Welfare and Poverty resolution.  THE SUBSTITUTE MINORITY WOMEN resolution  was developed by the Minority Women's Task Force of  the Minority Women's Caucuses. It asked that the  government remedy the double-discrimination minority  women face. Included in the resolution were statements  from American Indian and Alaskan Native women,  Hispanic women, Asian Pacific American women, and  Black women.  After passage of the resolution the minority women  were overjoyed.   The passing of this resolution signals that minority  women will not now or ever again have to talk to themselves,  said one smiling woman. The women's  movement had officially recognized and supported  minorities with open arms.   The women in this country are serious about their  rights,  said Coretta Scott King, IWY Commissioner.   When we get our solidarity as women we can move  on to other issues for 'man'kind.   Most IWY participants spent more time attending the  actual conference proceedings than the  typical   conventioneer usually spends taking part in convention  business. There were attractive activities outside the  coliseum.  Briefings from the Top  was a government  lecture series featuring distinguished women speakers,  including Virginia Dill McCarty, U.S. Attorney for the  Southern District of Indiana.  Eight how-to success stories and 15 skills clinics were  open to registrants attending the National Women's Conference. These clinics covered everything from how to  set up a shelter for battered women to parliamentary  procedure for beginners.  A FILM FESTIVAL INCLUDED such movies as  AMELIA EARHART, HOW WE WON THE VOTE,  IMAGES OF COUNTRY WOMEN, and SALT OF THE  EARTH.  Booths were set up by participating organizations.  They offered information on everything from Girl Scouts  to nuclear power.   Seneca Falls South  was an area devoted to entertainment by and for women. Stage programs starred  Jean Stapleton, Lily Tomlin, and Mario Thomas. A  women's library was available and there was space for,  artists which offered films, slides, lectures and displays.  Other activities outside the convention buildings included the rally honoring ERA author Alice Paul.  Houston Women's Advocate Nikki Van Hightower and  SEXUAL POLITICS author Kate Millet addressed the  crowd. Dolores Huerta of the United Farm Workers and  Flo Kennedy, writer, lecturer and founder of the  Feminist Party also spoke.  DURING THE ENTIRE CONFERENCE signs and  posters everywhere were held high. Here is a sampling:  ALICE PAUL, 1885-1977; ALCOHOLISM: A WOMEN'S  ISSUE: WOMAN'S LIP, FOLLOW JESUS CHRIST AND  YOUR HUSBAND AND YOUR PASTOR, REPENT; IF  MEN GOT PREGNANT ABORTION WOULD BE  SACRED; LESBIAN MOTHERS ARE PRO FAMILY;  EQUAL RIGHTS FOR THE UNBORN; ERA IS ANTI-  BIBLE; WE LIKE LADIES WHO LIKE BEING  LADIES; WHITE SUPREMACY, DOWN WITH  WOMEN; RATIFY THE ERA; SAFE, LEGAL ABORTION FOR ALL WOMEN; ERA IS A TURKEY; UP  WITH GOD, DOWN WITH GAYS; WHO NEEDS JEWS,  DIKES, ABORTIAN (sic), COMMUNISM; KLAN  KAN'TSTOPUS   At the beginning of the Conference, Barbara Jordan  said,  None of the goals stated in this Conference are incompatible with the goals of America. As a matter of  fact, the goals of this Conference sound like stanzas to   America the Beautiful . She said the goals are as   logical and reasonable  as the human rights the  President talks about.   HUMAN RIGHTS APPLY EQUALLY to Soviet  dissidents, Chilean peasants and American women,   Jordan said.   It may well be women, not men, who will be the  decisive force in seeing to it that the world's poor have  enough to eat, eat nourishing food, drink clean water,  live to adulthood and become literate,  said John J.  Gilligan, adminstrator of the Agency for International  Development.  At the end of the Conference women sang together.  Delegates and observers linked hands and stretched into  lines which wound back and forth across and around the  coliseum like links of a newly-forged chain. They must  have remembered Jordan's words that  This is the time  for foot soldiers, not kamikaze pilots.   Not every woman wanted to be a part of this. Conservative delegates staged a walkout and gathered together  to sing the  Battle Hymn of the Republic . At that  moment, Abzug dismissed the Conference. The packed  auditorium quickly became a mass of empty chairs as  women hurried to catch taxis, jets and planes.  SEN. GUBBINS HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE to  complain about stall tactics in the IWY and to say that  one of her Hoosier delegates was threatened. She also  said the conference would not allow the minority to include an official minority report with the materials to be  sent to President Carter.  The IWY Commisison's press conference came after  the Gubbin's conference and Abzug commented that this  was the spirit in which the conference had run. She said  that since the entire conference is a matter of public  record, the minority view will be reflected.   The Congressional mandate does not tell us to consider whether women should seek to end discrimination  or should seek full equality. Instead, it takes a stand for  equality. Our purpose is simple to say that women must  be free to choose what they do,  she said.  ACCORDING TO ABZUG,  We have to win real  political power for women because as long as the  Congress, the state legislatures and city councils are  dominated by men, we have to come as supplicants  rather than as decision makers.   Commissioner Jean Stapleton was optimistic about  the IWY.   The very presence of this number of women   the  majority pro-ERA   and the national awareness of this  conference and its report to the President and Congress  has got to have some effect on those women on the fence,  she said.  Commissioner Ruth C. Clusen reminded women that it  will take a large effort to finance the passage of the  ERA. At the beginning of the IWY Abzug had said,  our  journey is far from over. We have much to do when we  leave Houston. We have to see that the recommendations we support here become reality   and that will  be long, hard work.   THE IWY IN HOUSTON SHOWED that women can  weather the differences of opinion within their own'  ranks. Many seemed to view the various opinions as one  of the numerous strengths of the movement rather than  as a disadvantage.  Anthropologist Margaret Mead believes  This may  well be the turning point not only in the history of  the women's movement, but in the history of the world  .itself.   And judging from the determined faces of the  thousands of women who left Houston for home, it hardly  looks like the end of the women's movement.  an independent womens newsjournal  women in struggle  politics, health, work, prison  news coverage and political analysis  on the issues that affect womens lives  contributing sub   12 or more  one year sub  6    sample copy 60e  foreign   13    Canada  7  business and institutions  20  oob, 1724 20th st. nw,  wash, dc 20009

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Women  THE REPORTED IMPACT OF WOMEN'S STUDIES  COURSES ON STUDENTS LIVES  Allana Cummings Elovson and Irene Cockcroft have  been conducting research on the impact of Women's  Studies courses on students at San Diego State University. A preliminary report on their data was distributed  in September. The complete study will be published  soon.  In order to obtain data, Elovson and Cockcroft  distributed a 22-item, open-ended questionnaire to 250  students. The preliminary results, based on the answers  of 136 students, indicate that 93  of the students think  that WS courses had some impact on their lives. The  areas of impact most frequently mentioned by students  were: new ideas (95 ), attitudes concerning other  women (82 ), themselves (76 ), men (75 ), women  not in the movement (74 ), child rearing (72 ),  women's roles (70 ), body and sexuality (62 ), politics  (63 ), behavior in class and job (72 ), social behavior  (67 ) future career plans (51 ).  ELOVSON AND COCKCROFT describe the students  reaction:  Most typically, students reported greatly increased feeling of self understanding, self esteem, and  self confidence; reduced feelings of dependency upon  men and upon others' opinions of them and less need to  project pretty image and be liked by all; vastly changed  attitudes of affection, identification and respect for  other women and consequently for their concept of  themselves as women; an upgrading in educational and  career goals as a consequence of a greatly expanded  view of women's possible role in society; deeper understanding of the influence of political, historical and economic factors in their lives and an increased interest in  politics; and a determination to raise their children in a  non-sexist manner.   The students also attributed to the classes their increased concern for and acceptance of their own bodies  and of their own and others' sexuality. They felt that  they were now more rational, more outspoken and more  critical. Some students felt that they were less angry after the courses while others felt that the WS courses had  awakened, or at least made them more aware of, their  anger against men. Some of the students found their new  awareness confusing and difficult to live with, but few of  them wished to give up that awareness.  In their report, Elovson and Cockcroft give some more  extensive information about the date they have gathered  so far and also a sample questionnaire. In concluding the  preliminary report, they point out that  the kinds of  things students report happen to them as a result of  taking these courses are totally consistent with the most  lofty goals and purposes of higher education.   For further information contact Allana Elovson at 442  8th Street, Del Mar, CA 92014.  Page 11  The parents of 11 Navajo girls have filed lawsuits  seeking more than  5 million in damages against three  male employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The suit  claims that the girls, between 11 and 13 years old, were  sexually assaulted by these men at the Teec Nos Pos  Boarding School.

The owners of a small feminist enterprise in  Kalamazoo, Michigan are crying fie at the accusation  with a rib-tickling spoof of Fortune magazine's listing of  the top 500 giant corporations.  With fingers slightly grubby from their own business  of raising worms, Mary Appelhof and Ilda Wissman,  co-owners of Flowerfield Enterprises, have prepared  an elegant certificate and membership card for those  who wish to join the  Ms. Fortune 500  registry.  CRITERION FOR MEMBERSHIP? Any  feminist  business with a minimum cash flow of  500 per annum.   With tongue out of cheek, Appelhof says,  So much of  our economy is geared to 'bigger is better' that the  small, diverse businesses can't compete with the larger  corporations. You see evidence of this in Fortune  magazine's listing of the top 500 corporations in the  United States. Exxon headed the list in 1975 with 44  billion dollars worth of sales. The top 10 corporations  had over 220 billion dollars worth of sales  That's a lot  of concentration among a few    We believe that little businesses count, too, and  feminist businesses are frequently little businesses. So  we've decided to register feminist businesses who buy  and sell  500 worth of goods and services in a year.  Almost anyone who claims to be in business at all will  spend  500 a year   letterhead, postage, phone, advertising   it all adds up.   WE BELIEVE LIFE is more interesting with lots of  different kinds of shops, products, restaurants. We don't  like to be limited to buying from a chain store or supermarket; to seeing the same basic news events covered  on three different TV networks. This planet has much  more variety than our economic structure encourages.  We've taken this route to let people know that bigger  isn't necessarily better. Small is good, too, and it sure is  more fun    Premier offering of the opportunity to register in the  Ms. Fortune 500 was made at the NOW (National  Organization for Women) National Convention at  Detroit, April 1977. Each business registered receives a  certificate and membership card for  2. As of December  1977,96 businesses have been registered.  One of the first to be registered (certificate No. 10)  was The Woman's Touch, Inc., 6352 West 37th St., a  feminist owned and operated business in Indianapolis.  The Woman's Touch is a feminist bookstore and personal growth/counseling center. The bookstore  specializes in the smaller presses and particularly  feminist press publications. Also available are records,  posters, t-shirts, and other items which deal with issues  crucial to woman's experience. The counseling center  provides feminist therapy for individuals, groups and  couples, marriage and family counseling. Therapy is  available on a fee scale depending on the total income of  the clients. The counseling center is directed by Rev.  Jeanine C. Rae. The co-owners of The Woman's Touch  are Jeanine C. Rae and Joyce A. Borne.  TO AVOID GROWLS OF DISCRIMINATION, Appelhof says,  Men can be feminists too. Some of our best  friends are male feminists. As long as they truly believe  in equal opportunities for women and are otherwise  eligible, of course they can register. We hope they do.   Future plans for Ms. Fortune 500 will be the publishing  of the Ms. Fortune 500 Directory, listing feminist  businesses from coast to coast/North to South.  If you are interested in being included in Ms. Fortune  500 or want to know more about it, contact Joyce A.

COPELAND, Indianapolis  The Women's Forum Quarterly published by the Seattle Central Community College is a new program here in  our community college to service the needs of women  students.  We are interested in an exchange system of newsletters, so we can develop a literature table. Enclosed is a  copy of The Quarterly. If you have any questions or are  interested in exchanging please write.  Thank you,  WENDY GALLEGES, Women's Space  Seattle, Washington  Please  send  me  a   sample  copy  of  your  new  publication. I read your ad in  Free University . I'm  excited Indianapolis women have united to produce their  own publication.  Sincerely.  CHRIS JENSEN, Sheridan, Indiana  We are most happy to help in the struggle to keep  WOMANKIND alive. It is important that we have a  forum available to all women   to publish our thoughts,  experiences, desires, fears. The next issue of our  newsletter will be coming out in early February, and we  will include a story about the newspaper.  As far as mentioning our newsletter,  WOMEN'S  STUDIES IN INDIANA, in WOMANKIND, thank you for  saying the newsletter is free and available by writing  to the Women's Studies Program, Memorial Hall East  128, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47401.  There has been some difficulty with periodical subscriptions this year, but we have sent in a voucher to  subscribe to WOMANKIND; and, we do have issues  available in the Women's Studies Resource Center.  Please let us know how we can help further.  JEAN C. ROBINSON,     Bloomington, Indiana  Congratulations on your publication. Certainly Indianapolis has long needed such a fine and literate forum  for the expression of women's ideas, talents and concerns.  I especially enjoyed Allegra Stewart's article about Gertrude Stein in the second issue. I hope that you are able to  continue your fine work. During the past few months, I  have mentioned the publication to some of my friends and  to my students. I have encouraged people to submit articles, poetry, reviews, and fiction.  I am enclosing a personal check to cover a subscription.  Also, I am attaching a review of Fred Zinnemann's new  film JULIA. Ann Blunk encouraged me to write this  review and when I was ready to toss it into the  wastebasket, she continued to encourage me to modify,  revise, polish, and type. I will be extremely grateful for  any consideration that you are able to give this article.  Meanwhile, take care and continue your commendable  work. Best wishes for a joyous holiday season.  Yours sincerely,  RITA M. ROSS, Indianapolis  I enjoy WOMANKIND very much and hope it will continue to be published. I think it is an interesting slant on  the woman's view.  STELLA REESE, Indianapolis  Thank you very much for writing to us about possible  support from the Indiana Committee for the Humanities  to publish the newspaper, Womankind. This is the second time we have had an inquiry about funding a monthly  journal.  As you can see by the enclosed grant information  booklet, publications are one of the ineligible areas for  humanities grants. ICH funds may pay for discussion  guides or booklets in connection with an approved  humanities program, but publications, in and of themselves, fall outside our capabilities.  The sample papers which you sent to us show what a   labor of love  the project has been. I want to compliment you on  the professional  appearance  of  WOMANKIND.  Best wishes in your quest for financial aid.  DONNA BUCOVE       Indianapolis  I am  interested  in  receiving  a  sample  of your  periodical.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Children  Two summers ago, I joined the Children of  God in Amsterdam.   Rather, I should say I was  a victim of mind control by the Children of God  in Amsterdam.  At nineteen, I was alone in Europe and afraid  of nothing.   I had been hopping trains and traveling for about one month.   First, having flown into  Luxembourg on Icelandic, I traveled by train to  Paris, Copenhagen, and then to Amsterdam.  I had been sharing an apartment for several  weeks with a friend near the Rijksmuseum.  Walking in the shopping area of Leidesplein one  day, I was accosted by a young man with a warm  smile.   He asked me if I wanted to share the love  of Jesus with him and be saved.   I was leery of  him at first, but as he continued to talk and  smile at me, I began to warm up to him.   He  said his name was Hashuba, and inviting me to  a disco called the Poorboy Club, he admonished  me again to let Jesus come into my life and be  saved.   I told him, thanks anyway, but added  maybe I'd stop by the disco that night since I  didn't have anything planned.  Walking home I thought to myself, NO WAY  will I go to that Jesus place     I had seen the  Children of God (COG) in Indianapolis knocking  on car windows trying to pawn their literature.  No way was I going to get involved with that   After I arrived home, my friend wasn't there  and faced with a dull evening alone,  I hopped  a tram and went to the club.   Upon arriving  at the club, I saw Hashuba at the door.   He  about jumped out of his skin when he saw me.  Smiling and hugging me, he introduced me to  his friends.   One good-looking guy put his arm  around me and walked me into the disco.   I  thought: Oh, my God, what is this?  Quickly,  I extricated myself and walked into another  room that looked like an informal library.   The  room was filled with young people of all nationalities talking to each other, reading literature  (called MO letters, put out by Moses David,  their leader).   I sat down, lit a cigarette, and  stared off into space.  Within a few minutes another young guy sat  next to me.   He introduced himself as Zach,  short for Zachariah.   I warmed up to him '  immediately.   He was from Detroit, Michigan;  the year before he had met up with the COG    while traveling with his girlfriend in Europe.  They both joined, and now he was extolling the  wonders of his new found faith.   Before I knew  it we were reading MO lit together, and dancing  and then he was praying with me and I was   saved .   I felt intoxicated, I was so high.  I had never experienced such  warmth and love   in all my life.   They wanted me to stay the night,  but collecting my senses, I knew I had to leave.  They begged me to come back tomorrow; I said I  had to visit a friend in Deventer tomorrow.   They  said,  Well, PLEASE come by before you leave    I left bedazzled and starry eyed.   Upon wak  ing the next morning, I could think of nothing  else but going back.    Zachariah instantly hugged  me as I walked in the door; so did Sharon, a '  beautiful black girl from South America.   In  fact,, all the people there looked beautiful.  They all had sparkling eyes and smiles that  never quit    Sharon and Zach latched onto me,  and before I knew it I was preparing lunch for  Of    God  ViihiTili  ill  STAFF  ASSOCIATE EDITOR  Mary Osborn  CONTRIBUTORS  Anonymous  Karla Ashmore  Amy Baron  Joyce Borne  Pat Heidenreich  Barbara Juday  Roberta Lynch  Henri Means  Judith Rae Rogers  Anita Speer Smith  Nancy Sundell  Maxyann Wampler  Carol Wilds  The Editors of WOMANKIND believe the contributors and  all those involved in this publication are part of this staff.

At lunch they  all gathered around the table, held hands, and  began to speak in tongues.   I looked around in  disbelief.   Catching the eye of another babe  (they call their new people  spiritual babes ),  I tried to hold down my laughter.  After lunch, I told them that I had to leave  as my friend, Dinike was expecting me.   They  all began  loving me up  (talking, persuading,  hugging, and kissing me) in an effort to make me  stay.   I stayed, but still possessing some will and  determination, I left them at night, though promising I'd return.   Again, I felt relief as I left,  but also a compulsion I could not explain to return.   I  felt hypnotized in a way, especially  when they looked at me.  The next week I was back in Amsterdam and  walking down Dam Square when I saw them.   I  felt helpless as they instantly recognized me.  They began  loving me up  again, and I said  I'd come by the disco that night.  I did; I spent the night there, and I joined the  next day.  Since the friend I was sharing the apartment  with was gone for two weeks, no one missed me  when I moved into the colony.   During the first  days I was in constant companionship with Sharon,  Zach and several others, doing chores with them,  reading,  singing,  selling literature on the streets      and I began speaking in tongues.    However,  I  began to eat less and less when I found out they  got old groceries free that were usually rotten.  I realized COG'S interest in material possessions  when Isaac told me he sold his business and two cars  to give the money to the Children of God.   When I  asked him why, he told me everyone did this since  they had no use for them in the kingdom of heaven.  Then I noticed them trying to win new converts by  pairing opposite sexes.   Zach would talk to girls  that came in, and I was supposed to start talking  to the guys.  I finally started waking up when I worked in the  disco one night. They encouraged me to look sexy  (like a  mountain maid  should) and ask the guys  who came in the disco to dance. I felt like a religious prostitute  Happily most of the guys lost  interest as soon as I opened my mouth about Jesus,  though I did win two converts.  The following account is taken from my journal  the last few days I spent with the COG.

By KARLA ASHMORE  spent one week with them,   yet it clearly  illustrates my struggle to preserve my identity  against the group pressure to conform as a COG  member:  SUNDAY, August 8,  1976   What a trip--know -  ing my plane left today    But I just didn't think  about it.   In fact I'm not doing much of that  lately.   I love these folks, but I don't know if  their trip is mine.   Helped them distribute MO  lit today.   In fact, I prayed with two guys on  the street.   What's happening to me?   I don't  even know why I'm praying with them.   I don't  think it's going to save their souls--and I don't  think this is where it's at as far as God's concerned, and yet I'm doing it.  MONDAY, 9- - Time is nonexistent     I've been  doing the cooking for the evening meals and meet  ing new people everyday.   I changed my name to  Crystal Clear Water, it's in the MO Letter called   Mountain Men  and so people don't call me Karla  anymore.  TUESDAY, 10--I'm so depressed.   My ticket ex  pires tomorrow and I feel so trapped here.   I got up  and went to the train station and called Icelandic to  have them put me on the waiting list.   Found out  the trains that leave for Luxembourg during the day  and wrote the times down and put the paper in my  pocket.   Came back to the house and read a scripture with Crystal Faith, Sharon, and Zach--then  made breakfast.   After breakfast I played some  guitar or tried to play.   I've lost the desire or the  feeling of the instrument.   I just am not playing  well.   So I went over and talked to Sharon and she  could see right through me.   She must have a sixth  sense cause I haven't let on about my feelings.She  told me that the Lord will take things away from  us to  break us down,   so that we concentrate on  him and not ourselves.   She reads to me and asked  me to read and I couldn't even do that--so I went  upstairs and sat and cried.   God    I felt my insides  were bursting   it was the strangest feeling.   I felt  like I had no identity--nothingness.   Mordecai  came up to talk to me--and I couldn't even talk.  So he said to come down later.   Well,  I didn't  He was the last COG I saw.   Somehow, I don't  even know now how I did it.   But I slowly and  methodically packed my stuff.   I wanted to get  my jacket, but I couldn't; it was downstairs a-  long with my sweater and Bible.   And I swear  it wasn't me who braved my way out of that  place, because if anyone would have seen me  leave I know I wouldn't have left.   Because somehow I was just nothingness and they easily could  have persuaded me to stay.   But I walked down  the two flights of stairs with backpack in hand  and didn't encounter one person   which surprised  me so much because the place is always swarming  with people.   I opened up the side door and just  walked out. Went a roundabout way to the station,  bought my ticket and some new tobacco with the  last few guilders I had, and headed for Luxembourg.  Arrived there at 11 p. m. and spent the night in the  train station.  I spent two days and nights in the Luxembourg  airport trying to get home.   I called and had my  mother wire a new ticket for me, since my other  had expired.  I came home in time to register at IUPUI.   Every  moment I was home, I wanted to go to the bank,  take out my money, and go back.   Then I ran into  a guy selling MO literature.   He smiled and said he  was working his way to Europe with a group of young  people   I had to fight every instinct I had to leave  my car and join him.  Now I only feel regret for the people caught in this  organization.    Zach (nee Tom) received a call from  his parents while I was there.   He didn't listen to a  word they said, he only repeated the same love and  Jesus words he had said to me.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  'We   have   this   place...   THE   WOMAN'S  By NANCY SCOTT  TOUCH,   Inc  They knew only one thing about business--  mat they wanted to run their own.   Jeanine C.  Rae and Joyce A. Borne are co-owners of  The  Woman's Touch, Inc.,   a feminist center/bookstore on the northwest side of Indianapolis.  Both women quit well-paying jobs in the prime  of their career lives to start a worn en's store  which would be comfortable for all women,  lesbian or straight.   They wanted to have a place in  which women could take pride--not just Joyce and  Jeanine's place, but everyone's place.   If we had sat down and really thought about  it we probably wouldn't have done it,   said Joyce,  manager of the store.   I even had math anxiety,  she said.   The  friends went ahead converting their idea into  reality and in the process they have learned a  number of skills including record keeping, tax  recording, and book selection.   They have  also learned a great deal about patience.   The Woman's Touch  started out when  four women pooled their efforts and finances,  but two of them eventually sold their portions to  Jeanine and Joyce, two women who are now in their  40's.   We're the oldest around,  they say, comparing  their ages to those of their clientele.  The store is a multi-service center and the co-  owners'backgrounds fit neatly into the expanded  activities offered by  The Woman's Touch.   Joyce  is a registered nurse and Jeanine is a minister.  Jeanine Rae and Joyce Borne respond to WOMANKIND reporter's questions.   (Photo by K. Niles)   The Woman's Touch  offers psychotherapy;  educational services, including open forum events and  workshops; consumer health education, and  SisterCelebration, worship-sharing designed to meet  a woman's spiritual needs.  The bookstore retails books, records, posters,  T-shirts, jewelry, feminist art and other items relating  to women's experience.  Jeanine and Joyce use their collective skills to  nurture the center and to support the women's community in Indianapolis and around the nation.   They  attend conferences and women's events throughout  the country.   They makfi new friends and contacts  through these activities and serve as a communications  link between women and women's organizations.   We learned to wheel-and-deal in a fun way.   It  is easy and fun to work with other women in business.  They are honest, pleasant and up-front.   Business  isn't highly competitive and women don't try to rip  us off,  said Joyce.  After all the conferences and music festivals  The  Woman's Touch  has attended they have experienced  theft rarely.   Women want us to make it,   said Joyce.   If they ripped us off they would be ripping them-  off,   said Jeanine.  The women explained how they count buttons and  badges before and after setting up their booth.  According to Jeanine,  We don't even miss a button.   The store purchases its merchandise from women  whenever possible.   It cooperates with feminist  business across the country, like the Washington,  D.C. distributor from which they buy books.  When this reporter arrived to interview Joyce and  Jeanine they were purchasing clay pots from a  woman who had never sold any of her work before  because she lacked the confidence and thought her  pots were not good enough.    The Woman's Touch   bought the pots and arranged for the potter to do  more work for the feminist community.  But selling is more  of an incidental occurrence,  almost a sideline at the shop.   A pamphlet at the  store says the  primary focus of  The Woman's  Touch' is one of enabling women to minister to and  with other women.     Another focus is  encouraging  persons to bring about social changes which insure  the equality of the sexes.    True to this philosophy,  The Woman's Touch   works to support social change by cooperating with  organizations such as The National Organization  for Women, The Coalition for Human Rights,  Gay People's Union of Indiana, and Hiatus... for  Womanspace.   It supports the development of  feminism and the arts by having one-woman art  exhibits, by encouraging non-sexist drama such as?  that produced by WomanShine Productions, and by  participating in the local chapter of the Feminist  Writer's Guild.  Every year  The Woman's Touch  has a Birthday  Benefit to help an organization get on its feet.   The  first benefit was for the Everywoman Center and   The Woman's Touch.    The second was for Woman-  shine Productions and next year it's for Womankind  (smile).   The benefits are always entertaining,  featuring drama, music, poetry and song.   In short,  WOMANTALENT.  Both Joyce and Jeanine went through a number  of changes before they arrived at the helm of  The  Woman's Touch.'5  Jeanine was the first woman to be ordained in  Indiana.   She became an American Baptist minister,  a clinical member of the American Association of  Marriage and Family Therapists and a  fellow  in  the American Association of Pastoral Counselors.  A divorced mother of three, times were not  always easy for Jeanine.    She wanted to go to  graduate school but, initially, was too afraid.  Eventually she overcame this fear and earned  an M. S. and a Masters of Divinity.   The educational system is a mess.   It's not fun,  though it could be.   It could be creative but it  teaches people more to calcify because of the  rigidity and the mickey mouse stuff you have to put  up with to get a degree,  said Jeanine.   Nevertheless,  she completed the necessary work and went on to  work as an assistant chaplain at the Indiana Girls  School and as chaplain at Winona Hospital.  Jeanine's relationship with the church and her  views of religious activity have changed drastically  through the years.   She grew up in a  liberal  church  where  social change and not just personal evangelism   was emphasized.    As an adult she left politics and  social action behind her as she struggled with interpersonal relationships.   In time she realized she had  cut herself off and she started to become politically  involved again.   She was asked to be on the Task  Force on Women for the American Baptist Churches.  In this position she began to look at sexism within the  church.   Although there was never a time when  American Baptists would not ordain women, women  were always a very small percentage of the ordained  and they had limited opportunities because of sexist  attitudes and practices.   Jeanine began to understand  the angry feeling she had experienced in church.  She broke off with the church and within two years    fflr-woriflrrj  TOycjliHQ.  6352 w  37th St.  (37th b High School Rd.)

(Photo by K. Niles)  started her feminist business.  This break freed Jeanine to expand her own views  of spirituality.   She recognized a need for women  to have female imagery--a Mother Goddess.   Out  of that recognition came the SisterCelebration  and Jeanine's matriarchal concepts.   Matriarchy is a creative dynamic--the basis is  nurturing, equality, love, cooperation, creativity and  justice--the kinds of essentials necessary for people  to exist peaceably with people--not all that different  from the spirit of the gospel,but the church's  interpretation has gotten away from those aspects,    said Jeanine.   Women, in spite of the church, have been  through generations the embodiment of those  spiritual dimensions,   she said.  The SisterCelebration practices this spirituality  the first Friday of every month at the store.   Sisters  read, pray, sing, play and listen to women's music  and partake of bread and wine.   Services are led  by laywomen and cletgywomen.   Topics ramge  from self-healing to matrilineage.  Within the framework of  The Woman's  Touch,   Jeanine has continued practicing therapy  for individuals, groups and couples.   Five counselors  see clients who pay according to a sliding scale.  Jeanine's therapy methodology encourages people  to change themselves AND the structures that brought  about their misery.   Therapy often focuses on the  structures in society that oppress women.   Getting people politically involved fits in with  religious therapy,   said Jeanine.  Jeanine believes the conservative backlash is  going to  get a lot worse before it gets better.  Wei*re in for hard times,   she thinks. Her  feminist business is one way of fighting it.  Feminist business partner Joyce Borne grew up in  southeastern Indiana.   She received a B. S. in  nursing, an R. N. and a Masters in Personality  Theory and Religion.   Between 1963 and 1965 she  served in Malaysia as a Peace Corps volunteer.   The Peace Corps taught me I could be very  independent and survive.   It enabled me to travel  and that changed my concept of what America is.  I appreciate a lot of things about America that I  wouldn't have otherwise,   she said.   I also found out a lot I didn't like about the  attitudes of others toward America.   I found  out  Big Daddy America  didn't have all  the answers,      she said.  Joyce spent eight years working at Winona  Hospital.   She grew up wanting to be a nurse or  teacher and when she received a scholarship she  went into nursing.   Joyce was responsible for teaching  patient education and her special area was chronic  disease and diabetes.   Her personal emphasis in  teaching is on preventive medicine and how to care  for one's own health so as not to over-utilize  expensive health services.  At the hospital Joyce became  burned-out and  disillusioned.   As she became more aware of the  administrative patriarchy and how it affected female  employees/patients, it was increasingly harder for her  to work there.   It wasn't Winona,   she said,  it was any health  care facility.  Joyce wanted to become more  involved at  The Woman's Touch  so she would work  all day at the hospital and then pick up the evening's  business at the store.   My 40th birthday was a significant time,   she  said.  (Continuedon next page)

Sharon told me they were  sent by Satan in  sheep's clothing.   Another French  girl's sister came to the colony to try to talk sense to  her.   I know she didn't hear a word she said.  I realize now that what I was experiencing inside  the organization was  ego-loss  (brainwashing).   In  fact, they encourage this.   They all give up their  identities, personalities, and material possessions  and assume a lifestyle interpreted by Moses David.  I could not play guitar or write in my journal for  they frowned on this.   I must learn their songs and  read their journals and think their thoughts.  Today, the COG are mostly in Europe because of  a report by the Charity Frauds Bureau which discredited their operations.  A quote from the report which was included in  the book  Let Our Children Go , by Ted Patrick  stated:   The COG engages in a particularly reprehensible course of conduct by tampering with the personalities of converts.  They proceed in a calculated, systematic manner, albeit without even the  informal consent of the victims, to  change established behavior patterns.   By manipulation and constant monitoring of thought processes, by making  younger members uncomfortable and exposed to psychological cruelties. . . a total assault on the psyche is accomplished.  Brainwashing techniques are deliberately  employed under the rationalization that  it is in the service of a good cause.

If I'd stayed much longer at Winona I  couldn't have afforded to leave,   Joyce said.   In  1977, after 18 years of nursing, she quit the hospital  work and started managing  The Woman's Touch.   Joyce still does consultant work for a Division  of the Services for the Blind which deals with  diabetics.   Through  The Woman's Touch  she  educates people about diabetes, hypoglycemia,  diet and consumer health   I work longer hours now than I ever did at  the hospital,   Joyce said.   It tires me but its a growth-producing  tiredness.    Joyce and Jeanine are still full of new ideas.  In a couple of months they hope to have a full-time  career evaluator who will counsel newly-divorced  women, professional women wanting career changes,  and executives on their way up.   They are planning  a ping pong tournament in the near future and they  have plans for a resource file on women topics.   It  can be used by anyone interested in herstory.  Dreams for the future include a retreat on a large  piece of land.   It would be a healing center  with space for gardening, crafts, and housing for  those in the process of redirecting their lives.   The Woman's Touch  is a place where people  go to chat, read, gain support, or even to help  Jeanine and Joyce with their mailings.  The co-owners have had to jump hurdles.   After  having given up their old jobs and incurring loans  to keep the store going, the shop has been a  financial drain.   We take out what we barely need,   said Joyce.   It takes a real committment but you know it's  what you really want to do and your whole being  is invested in it    The partners have found out, in the last two years,  how proud people are of  The Woman's Touch.

If you don't know it,  you should.  To honor Jeanine and Joyce at the recent  Birthday Benefit, this matriarchal story was  composed and read by Nancy Sundell, accompanied by music and interpretative  dance  Goddess  Nammu  By NANCY  SUNDELL  The cast of PATCHWORK POWER (a WomanShine  Production) as presented at The Woman's Touch  Birthday Benefit, ( Photo by K. Niles    In that time now mysterious to us of the Great  Matriarchy, Goddess was worshiped in Her many  forms and expressions.  Nammu, who created the heaven and the earth  was recognized, cherished, and worshiped by Her  daughters.  We have learned, the temples of Nammu were  destroyed by the violent patriarchy and Great  Goddess Nammu was thought to have been destroyed--to have died--to have ceased.  But, of course, She did not die.   As the tide  returns, the leaves return in the springtime of  every year, as the creatures in unending cycles  return to their home, so does Goddess Nammu  make fferself known to Her daughters again.  For Nammu has watched over all Her daughters  through all their long, dark winters and She has  always seen their need for renewed life and hope.  As Goddess Nammu watched, She saw the  dreams, heard the cries, and felt the terrible  loneliness of Her daughters.   She beheld the scattered women who did not know their own family  of women and who did not know that they were  all sisters.   And as She had once taught Her  daughters long before,  She began to join them  together, like a patchwork.  On Her earth, Nammu searched for daughters in  many places.   She searched for special women who  would help to draw women together.   In a place  where the native American women had once  walked, She found many sisters with dreams, fears,  and hopes they did not know how to share.   And  Nammu knew that here a community of sisters  could grow and flourish.  Slowly Her plan took shape.   Among the  scattered women there, She found one daughter  who was struggling to ease the torments and fears  of women.   She had studied in a patriarchal  seminary searching for the answers of the spirit.  She was an ordained leader, and teacher, and  healer.   Her name was Jeanine and Nammu was  well pleased.  And Nammu found another daughter, another  healer, one who had studied and learned among  the nurses and physicians.   She had a sound sense  of survival in the world of science and of business and yet she too cried out for her sisters.   Her  name was Joyce--and Nammu was well pleased.  It came to pass that Goddess Nammu guided  these Sisterfriends to create a space so that Her  other daughters might gather.   The space came,  of course, not without struggle and pain, for  the Goddess Nammu knows well the strengthening fire of pain and the growth that springs  from cold loneliness.  As Jeanine and Joyce grew and became  stronger in their work, their created space  began to grow and to fill with women.   They  came to worship, each in her own way,  and to  study, to find healing, to share their skills and  creative energies, to learn to heal one another,  to dream together, to hope together.   And as  it always has been with sisters, they began to  spark in one another the poetry, the music, the  colors and forms and images of their singular  beauty.   The sisters learned to celebrate their  world, their Mother Earth, their Family of  Women, their renewal and warm strength.  All mothers mark the birth of their daughters with a special remembering and with  great thanksgiving.   And so it is that on this  day, we share with Great Nammu Her thanksgiving for Her two daughters, Jeanine and  Joyce, for their work, and for their struggle,  and for their special woman touching place  for all the Sisterfriends.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Case     Of     Rape  By  HENRIMEANS   Hey, Cynthia, do you want somebody to walk you to  your car?  The thin, lithe young woman stood in the  drafty hallway and stared out into the pitch darkness of  the November night.  Naw, that's okay, I'm a big girl  now,  then smiled apologetically,  Really, I'll be okay.   She pulled her warm, thin coat closely around her ebony  frame and pushed belligerent strands of her short Afro  beneath the slightly soiled scarf tied closely about her  head.  Cynthia Williams was twenty-two and had worked at  the 16th St. Christian Community Center for the past  seven years. Not an exotically beautiful woman, her  smooth, blemishless, even-toned, tan skin, her slightly  pugged, slightly bulging brown nose, her widely spaced  brown eyes and her delicately molded, highly placed  'Indian' cheekbones (her great-great grandmother had,  supposedly, been a full-blooded Navajo Indian), bespoke  of a vaguely appealing 'cuteness.' She had no great difficulty obtaining boyfriends and was rumored to have  obtained them, on occasion, by somewhat unscrupulous, sometimes bordering on the unmoralistic,  methods.  SHE HAD LEFT HIGH SCHOOL in her junior year,  actually frustrated with the idea that her graduation  was the following year and frightened by the harsh  prospect that poor,B4ack, somewhat plain girls, with no  apparent talents, did not have a lot to offer a rich,  grasping, greedy society, and by the fact that unemployment lines were exceedingly long and particularly  prone to have Black occupants. She had left, fleeing in  the face of impending, certain adversity and had  retreated to the welcome, easy recesses of working at  the community center she had attended so many  evenings throughout her childhood days.  The 16th Street Community Center was, at one time, a  flourishing church, with a large following of poor, Black  Baptists. Over a period of years, the church membership had scraped together enough funds to erect a new  building several blocks away and had vacated the tumbling, rodent-infested structure to the neighborhood  children as a community center. Children of garbage  collectors and day workers (or maintenance engineers  and household technicians, as the politely soulless  society had renamed these common workers in an attempt to supposedly restore their long trampled dignity  and, covertly, to work even more dollars out of their  tired, work-worn fingers), spent many evening hours at  the center, playing basketbal every evening (even Sundays), bingo on Fridays, and shooting dice in the  seclusively dark corners beneath rickety staircases.  TEENAGE GIRLS WERE repeatedly warned by apprehensive parents to go everywhere in this neighborhood with at least two other well-known friends, and  to never talk to strangers, because rape was not an uncommon phenomena.  But it was one, the thoughts of which often eluded  young Black women who had been raised in the neighborhood and who had, over a period of years, become,  like the alley wino who reeked of drink and urine, but  was not offended by the smelly stench, subconsciously  immune to the thoughts of being forcibly coerced into an  act that came so freely when they were attracted to their  counterparts. The girls in the area were by no means  'fast' or 'free-and-easy', but they had somehow escaped  RECOMMENDED  READING  j  v The   Novel   by     /    I Karen Snow.

And so, Cynthia, psychologically immune to thoughts  of an act that she had managed to escape for so long,  thought no more of rape on this evening than she had in  the past seven years that she had been working at the  center. She walked, shivering from the cool briskness of  the night air, toward her car parked in the lightless confines of the deserted dirt alley.  IT WAS NOT A NEWER MODEL MUSTANG and it  was somewhat 'junky' from several years of the wear  and tear its former owner had inflicted long before Cynthia had purchased it, two years ago, from a sleazy,  second-hand dealership on 19th Street. But Cynthia  loved it because, unlike the crowded, dingy, apartment  that she shared with her three sisters over the College  St. Motel, where prostitutes frequently brought their  'john' to earn a couple of 'easy-tax-free-dollars', the car  was all hers, with no one else to lay claim on it but she.  She thrust her hands into the side pocket of her frayed,  cheap, synthetic-imitation-leather purse, then stared  surprised at the projecting knob, indicating that the door  was already unlocked, and probably had been so since  she had come to work at 3:30 that afternoon. It was now  12:30 and she was cold and tired from working all  evening, and didn't give the possibility of apparent  danger a second thought.  I probably left it unlocked  because I was so late forjwork. After all, I was a half-  hour late getting to work today. I'd better watch that,  though,  She shrugged off danger, speaking unheard to  a cold, unfeeling, November wind. She pulled the door  open and slid, effortlessly into the front seat, without  giving the oddity another thought. As she reached forward to put the key into the ignition, she felt a gruff,  calloused hand clamp down tightly over her mouth and  jerk her head violently backwards.  Look, Don't try to  scream and don't say anything. I'm not going to hurt  you, I jus' wanna talk to you a while.  The words were  hurried and slurred together, as if her unwelcome intruder sensed that someone would appear, at any  moment, and interrupt whatever plans he had.  Fear engulfed her, stifling her senses, blocking her  mental processes. Her heart pounded in her body as if to  break free, at any moment now. Tears welled in her eyes  and a scream in her stifled vocal passage.  Look, now,  don't kick and bite and scratch and all of that. I don't  want to hurt you, I said.''  His sweaty, putrid body odor offended her in the same  way that the gymnasium often did after several hours of  continuous basketball games played by the cursing,  pushing, belligerent, teenage boys who frequented the  center.  Now, I want you to just pull the keys out of the  ignition and hand 'em to me.  He extended his other  hand, palm upward, and she dropped the keys into it.   Okay, now, turn around and just climb into the back  seat, okay?  Again, she complied and he obligingly  scooted over to make room for her to sit beside him in  the cramped back seat of the small car. Then she turned  and looked, for the first time, at the stranger who had so  rudely, so callously, forced his way into her company.  He was a heavy-set, dark-skinned, wooly headed man  with bloodshot eyes and a wide, toothy, grinning, leering  smile sprawled across his face. He wore a tattered,  dingy white T-shirt and acid-stained green khaki pants.   Now look, I'm going to let go of your mouth now, but  if you scream, I'll choke you to death right here and now.  You understand?  Cynthia shook her head up and down  several times to signify that she would comply. He  dropped his left hand from her mouth and stuffed the car  keys into his pants pocket with the other hand. Then he  looked at her, and in one, awful moment, his leering look  told her exactly what she had feared, exactly what she  had no desire to believe. She knew what to expect next  and she also knew that she was powerless to protect herself, to prevent it, to stave it off.   LOOK, I GOT SOME MONEY, just take that and  please leave me alone. Please.  His facial muscles contorted as he laughed, suddenly, ruthlessly. One loud explosive guffaw at her feeble attempt to escape the impending crime. Then he stopped as suddenly as he had  begun, and leaned lecherously toward her.  Hey, girl,   he whispered maliciously,  You might like it, you never  know.  He ripped at the buttons on her thin overcoat,  then thrust his grimy hand instrusively into her blouse,  and with the other hand, forced her quickly,  passionlessly, violently, downward in the seat. She gave  her attacker the most forceful push she could muster  and attempted to raise her knee to his pelvic area. Her  attempt was unsuccessful. He slapped her several times  and brought one powerful hand to her throat,  threateningly tightening it about her frail neck as he did  so.  Alright, now,  he was unscathed.  Simmer down.  I'm warning you.   Her fear was all-encompassing, but her will to survive  was stronger.  Okay,  she muttered,  Okay, but please,  just don't hurt me.  She closed her eyes to his fearfully  close unsightliness and she closed her mind to the  uninvited liberties that he took with her forcibly plied  body...  The next morning they found her body huddled in the  back seat of the dingy, black mustang. She had been  brutally, repeatedly violated, then strangled. Her thin  neck had been virtually crushed from the sheer brutality  of her rapist's murderous attack. The contents of her  purse were emptied on the seat and any money that  might have been in it was gone, stuffed into the grimy  pocket of her attacker.  THE CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT supposedly  searched for her rapist-murderer. But, like the muggers  and con-artists and dope-pushers who freely roamed the  poor Black neighborhood and preyed upon its prone  inhabitants with regularity, simply by virtue of social  status of his victim, her attacker had granted himself a  certain amount of immunity to arrest. How many city  dollars would be spent to capture the attacker of a twenty-two year old poor, Black, unmarried, high school  dropout whose most significant contribution to society  had been that she had never tried to draw unemployment from the state?  Her funeral was held the following Saturday. Her  three sisters wept bitterly. A couple of kids from the  community center dejectedly shook their heads. The  director of the community center looked singularly  unhappy.  A week later he hired a new girl to replace Cynthia. He  told her to make sure that she locked her car every day  when she came to work and to always get one of the  fellas to walk her to her car in the evenings. Somebody  that she knew pretty well. He didn't tell her why he was  so insistent about it, though.

        <pagetext>6.  WOMANKIND  Impressions  Of   A   Rape   Tri  It's Monday morning and I enter the courtroom  on the Monroe County courthouse.   I've been in  this room once before, but not for a trial.   It's  different.   Today it's quiet and almost empty--  four people over on one side, two in front of me,  and three more scattered behind.  The bailiff is straightening some papers; a woman is tinkering with recording equipment; a  man brings in a steaming cup and places it on  the judge's bench. (Later a man enters wearing a black robe: The Judge.)  The room still  looks much as it would have in 1918 when the  courthouse was built.   The wood is dark and  sombre looking, the eagle appears rather drab  against the yellowed background behind the  judge's head.   The face of the big clock is  equally yellowed.   Fluorescent lighting is the  only alien element.   No, there is something  else--I can't put my finger on it immediately.  A noise?   Window air-conditioners.   I'm sure  I won't be able to hear over them.  THE JUDGE ENTERS and acknowledges the  opposing lawyers, and the bailiff is instructed to turn the air-conditioners off.   Thank  goodness    One of the four seated on the  other side of the aisle rises and goes to a table  in front.   Twelve take the chairs, and 10 to  15 remaining people sit in a bench directly  behind the juror box.  The judge gives instructions to the potential  jurors, explaining what  reasonable doubt   means,  and what their responsibilities are in  this trial.   Questions are asked first by the  judge and then by the lawyers, in an attempt  to determine if each individual can make an  unprejudiced decision as to the guilt of this  man, who is accused of raping a young woman.  She is not present at this time.   After 11/2  hours, five people are excused and a recess is  called.   The air conditioners resume their hum.  In 15 minutes court reconvenes, and I expect  the testimony to begin.   But not so.   More and  more jurors are questioned and excused, until  all of the reserves are used up, people are called  at home and at work to come in immediately,  and others are subpoenaed while walking on the  courthouse square.    Some of the people obviously  don't want to serve on this jury, and answer  questions in a manner to insure being excused;  others are honest in admitting they have such  strong feelings about rape that they feel they  cannot be impartial; some are excused for  reasons known only to the attorneys.   Eventually  40 people have been questioned, and finally  MARYANN WAMPLER  12 are chosen:   5 women and 7 men.    COULD I BE an impartial juror?  I ask  myself.   I don't know.   I feel strongly that  rape in the past has not been treated as seriously  as it should have.   When   nice  women were  raped they never admitted it publicly.   The  trend was often to place the blame for the rape  upon the woman:  the- she asked  for it   theory.   Still, I find it intolerable to think a  man might be found guilty of rape, if indeed  he is not.   I certainly have no sympathy for  a woman who screams  RAPE   falsely.   As  a child I took the story of  The Boy Who  Cried Wolf very seriously.  As the young woman sits stiffly in the  witness stand, I again confront myself,   Could I do what this woman is doing?  The  questions get very personal.   In this particular  case, the question is not whether the act  occurred, but whether it was with or without  the consent of the woman.  I LEARN THAT A tape recording was made  of the woman's statement, as well as the  accused's, shortly after the police took charge.  It is played for the jury after the two principals  have testified.      Sometimes it doesn't  completely agree with the testimony they  have just given.   I can easily see how this  could happen as I have often tried to relate a  conversation or a series of events to someone,  and have been unable to do so in proper sequence or word for word, although I am  perfectly sure of the overall happening.  Surely after the trauma involved in a rape  situation, as a victim my thinking would be  completely disorganized.   If my testimony  deviated even a little, would the jury doubt  everything I said?  Unfortunately, when I am  most upset, but really want to express my  feelings, I sob, which makes me very angry  at myself, because it is when I am wanting  to be most articulate.   It would be so embarrassing to do this in front of all these people.  Another witness takes the stand, and again  I wonder about my courage.    Could I be as  good a friend as this woman's friend?    For  even she must feel unsure and somewhat  afraid.  Unsure for fear she won't remember events  properly, or say something that can be misconstrued.   Afraid because if the defendant is  acquitted, might he seek revenge?  Or do I  watch too many TV police shows?

Write for a free newsletter:  SEVERAL THINGS BECOME obvious to me.  If you are unsure of the intent of a man who is  making only vocal advances, assume the worst;  risk being rude and let him know you aren't  interested.   Period.   This is a time when communication is important    There should be no  doubt in his mind that you are saying NO.   By  being cautious, polite, ignoring his remarks or  avoiding advances, he may read you as being  coy and signaling a  come on.    This situation,  of course, is completely different from an attack  on a dark street or a break-in to your home.  No one seems to be able to give clearcut advice as to how to react to a rapist. Screaming  scares some men away (this would be most logical when there is a possibility of people nearby  to come to your assistance), but only excites or  agitates others, and may cause them to become  more violent. Besides, I don't know if I could  scream, or would be so scared I couldn't utter a  whisper.  Should you be passive or try to defend yourself   For one thing, women are taught from  childhood to be passive, and never get into even  minor fistfights or wrestling scuffles as boys do.  So how can they suddenly turn into tigers who  scratch, and bite and kick and seek to gouge an  eye?  If you try these tactics and don't escape,  is it not possible the consequences may be even  more brutal?  PASSIVITY IN THE PAST has often been  interpreted by jurors and judges alike as consent.  Such is part of the defense's case in mis trial.  No bruises, cuts, externally or internally on the  woman.   No scratches on the man.  A woman has  Five Seconds  to make her  decision.   I've had 2 1/2 days during  this trial  to evaluate the accused rapist to determine  whether I think he was bluffing when he said  Do  as I say or I'll kill you,   and 2 1/2 days to  decide whether she should have resisted or reacted as she did.   She had five seconds    That is,  indeed, something to consider.   There is NO time  to decide on a course of action.  THIS IS NOT the TV courtroom, and these are  not fictitious lawyers, or even famous real ones,  but still there is a mounting tension in the courtroom as the last hours draw near, and the lawyers  give their summations.   Each day has drawn a few  more interested spectators, and now all the seats  in the back are filled as personnel from nearby  offices slip in for the final scene.   When a citizen is robbed and his life is  threatened, society encourages him not to resist.  To save his life he should let a robber take all  his wealth, for nothing is more important than  life.   But when a woman is raped, society expects  her to risk her life by resisting.   She must have  cuts and bruises to prove that she tried to defend  herself.''   Those words by the prosecutor brought  a hush to the courtroom.  The jury is given lengthy instructions.   I  wonder how they remember all of them.   We  stand, and they leave silently.   Will they discuss  the points that I feel unsure about?  You thought  that I had my mind completely made up, didn't  you?  Anyone who would write this article, would  surely have no doubts about the guilt and innocence involved here.   But I do.... and that's what  makes the whole issue of a rape trial so scary   Reprinted with the author's permission from the  HERALD  TELEPHONE, Bloomington, Indiana,  Friday, August 25, 1978, p. 5 and 6.

ANITA  SPEER SMITH  Against Our Will   MEN,WOMEN AND RAPE  Susan Brownmiller  MAN INTIMIDATES WOMAN  By JUDITH RAE ROGERS  The thesis of  Against Our Will  is clearly stated  in the first chapter:    Man's discovery that his genitalia could serve as a weapon to generate fear must  rank as one of the most important discoveries of  prehistoric times, along with the use of fire and  the first crude stone axe.   From prehistoric times  to the present, I believe, rape has played a critical function.   It is nothing more or less than a  conscious process of intimidation by which all  men keep all women in a state of fear.    Much substantiation of this theory is presented  in a very organized, systematic, and (unfortunately ) believable way.   Laws concerning rape  that date back to ancient Babylonia and the time  of Moses are examined.   Example after example  of rape during wars are described, often through  the anguish-filled words of the women who were  raped.   The overabundance of particular instances  does NOT make the act seem commonplace or  condoned.   Each incident is horrible, tragic, agonizing, and heartbreaking.  A corollary to Brownmiller's thesis is that  Uprisings, riots, revolutions, and  minor skirmishes  with racial and political overtones all have provided  an outlet, and sometimes even an ideolgical excuse, for men to practice rape on women.    Individual studies are made of the American revolution,  pogroms in Poland and Russia, persecutions of the  Mormons, Ku Klux Klan violence, and rape in the  Congo.   The rape of American Indians and of Black  slaves are scrutinized in detail.  During a period of nine months in 1971 in Bangladesh, more than 200; 000   wo nen were raped  by Pakistani soldiers.    But the mass rape of  Bangladesh has not been unique.   The number of  rapes per capita during the nine-month occupation  of Bangladesh had been no grater than the incidence  of rape (by Japanese soldiers) during one month of  occupation in the city of Nanking (China) in 1937,  no greater than the per capita incidence of rape in  Belgium and France as the German army marched  unchecked during the first three months of World  War I, no greater than the violation of women in  every village in Soviet Russia in World War II.   This quotation is an example of the shocking  facts with which Susan Brownmiller has packed her  best selling book  Against Our Will: Men,  Women  and Rape.    Against Our Will  is scholarly yet readable.  Brownmiller adds a touch of amusing sarcasm  occasionally in this nonhumorous book, perhaps in order to survive the brutality of the  chilling facts. The author's swift-moving style  helps the reader press onward through this horrible journey of man's inhumanity to women.  We want simultaneously to continue reading and  to stop reading, and most of us will need to take  many breaks while reading this 541-page work.  I was emotionally drained as I read  Against  Our Will .   I felt raped, mutilated, degraded  along with the women throughout history.   I was,  in turn, angry, humiliated, resentful, yet hopeful  at the same time.   Hopeful that at last the truth is  out and changes can be made.  Brownmiller has a triple purpose in writing this  book    Not only does she uncover information that  has long been hidden, overlooked, avoided, and  lied about--she also tears down the numerous  myths surrounding rape and replaces them with  reality.   And perhaps most importantly, Brownmiller proposes specific recommendations to ensure  that needed changes will occur.   These changes  affect the attitudes of women, men, police, historians, journalists, army leaders, soldiers, judges,  jurors, lawmakers, and children  Brownmiller's original and accurate evidence is  documented and thorough.   Her authentic resources  include personal experiences, diaries, interviews,  newspaper articles, books, magazine articles, police  reports, letters, and statistics.   Most of her research  was done in the New York Public Library.   However,  material was also consulted in the New York State  Library,   the A. A. Brill Collection of the New York  Psychoanalytical Institute, the New York University  Law Library, the National Archives in Washington,  and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black  Culture in Harlem.  The author's section on Source Notes encompasses  fifty-one pages of 811 footnotes, which state the  source of a quotation or idea referred to.   There are  also many explanatory footnotes throughout the text  of the book.   It is understandable why it took four  y3ars for Brownmiller to complete the research and  writing of this comprehensive study   Seven years before  Against Our Will  was published, Brownmiller helped found (in 1968) the  New York Radical Feminists.   Not quite two years  later, in May, 1970, she led one hundred feminists in a sit-in in the offices of the  Ladies Home  Journal  where demands were made to stop using  ads that exploited women and to liberate the magazine.  In 1971, when she was 38, she organized a conference on rape, which made her challenge her  own views on the subject and led to her awareness  that research on rape was needed.   That same  year she took up jujitsu and karate in a belated  response to her recommendation that  what women need is systematic training in self-defense  that begins in childhood.    Prophetically, the author (bom in 1935) celebrates her birthday on February 15, the same  day as Susan Brownell Anthony (1820-1906).   Against Our Will has undoubtedly lent credence and insight to the many rape issues and  problems that confront us today.   The book is  of value to the Women's Movement and to women individually.  Though the book was written over three years  ago, the information is still current and valid.  It will assuredly continue to be a classic in the  writings of the Women's Liberation Movement,  and if you dare read it,  it will cause changes in  your life.  It takes courage to begin and to finish the book.  When and if you do, you'll feel hopeful and determined for Brownmiller's purpose in writing   Against Our Will  is to  give rape its history   and to  deny it a future.     Therein lies the hope.  631 C.  Ud)iaau  linbianapoli*, SM  46201  317-262*9106  LABYRIS  is  a private  club for women.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Cults     --A  Kool-Aid laced with cyanide--surely the  American way of suicide--even if it did take  place deep in the jungles of Guyana.   The  horror and the sheer madness of Jonestown are  leading many to dismiss it as simply the most  bizarre results of an increasingly common phenomenon--the messianic cult.  Charles Manson and his Family, the Rev. Sun  Moon and his Unification Church,  Chuck  Deierich and Synanon, Werner Erhard and est, David  Berg and the Children of God, Guru Mahraji and  the Divine Lighters, Steve Gaskin and the Farm,  Lyndon Larouche and the Labor Committee.   I  could go on; there are scores of smaller but no  less devoted bands.  Many people won't like this list.   They will  point out that this person or that one is actually  benign, or non-violent, or right-on.   They will  argue that this cult or that one is quite harmless--or even quite helpful.   They will note the  radical philosophy of this or that group.  They will go on in this vein, distinguishing their  current favorite from the rest of the pack.   And  they will not hear in their voices the echoes of  those who once defended the others--the Jim .  Jones' s who have now moved beyond the pale.  For it is possible to find, in almost all of  these  cases, some good that was done. People  who were saved from drugs, from alcohol, from  the streets.   People who claim to be much happier than they have ever been before in their lives.  Wouldn't it be more fair then to analyze each of  these groupings individually rather than simply lumping them all together?  I don't think so.   Because the real issue is not so  much what differentiates these groups as what binds  them: the all-powerful, all-knowing male leader.  The man who's calling the shots.

He was a pretty big deal. Today   whatever good these men might do--that's  what it's really all about--wanting a piece of the  power, wanting a place on the throne, wanting  control over people's lives.  It is a direct, emotional, and intoxicating  role--both different from and more accessible  than the standard avenues to authority in  America.   A congressperson may represent  100, 000 people as compared to Jones's 1, 000  or so, but could he get any 900 of them to  simply lay down and die for him?  It does not really matter whether these men are  good or bad, whether ostensibly of the left or right.  What matters is that they rule by personal charisma  rather than through any democratic process.   They  stand outside the traditions of free and informed  election of leadership.  More basically, what matters is that their followers do not live by any coherent structure or philos  ophy, but by their leaders' whims.   Individuals  are not taught to think, but to believe. Loyalty  to the leader surpasses loyalty to principle, to  self,  to community.   What matters is that in the  end nothing much matters except this man.  But there have always been people who wanted to  dominate--whether benignly or despotically.   The  more perplexing question is in regard to the dominated .   Why have so many Americans taken to looking for someone they can follow blindly and quote  mindlessly?  What makes people want to hand over  responsibility for their lives to someone else?  Some commentators have sought to blame the  Jonestown tragedy on the 60's with its freaks and  flower children.   In fact, the search for messiahs  is much more a product of the demise of that decade's idealism, of the recognition of the obstinacy of America's vices, of the social breakdown  brought on by the lack of new values to replace  the discredited old ones.  Social   Trend  By ROBERTA LYNCH  Not everyone goes to such lengths, of course, as  the cultjoiners.   But there are less dramatic related  developments in all parts of society.   What does it  mean, for instance, when evangelical religions     nearly all of them featuring a central dynamic  personality   grow at a faster rate than the established churches with their relatively anonymous  leadership?  While we remain a nation with a strong anti-  authoritarian current, there are other factors that  contradict this aspect.   Blind adoration of leaders  may seem a peculiarly un-American trait, but absence of critical thinking is right up there with apple  pie when it comes to true Americana.   This habit of  non-thought, so corrosive of any democratic impulse,  is the lifeblood of the messianic cult.   And it feeds  other social trends as well.  Contemporary capitalism seeks compatability  with democratic structures.   But its need for economic dominance and social mythology constantly thwarts the democratic process.   It has erected  a communications nexus that limits information  and experiences, an educational system that  stifles curiosity and creativity, and a national ethos  that downgrades individuality even as it touts individual success.   The result has been a conscientious,  if not conscious, program of social control.  Now that the existing structures are beginning to  crack, the inadequacy of this foundation has given  people few means to fully understand or grasp their  reality.   The '7O's have been marked more by ideological confusion than by any clear social or political theme.  We will continue to look for simple solutions--or  saviors-- until we learn how to make sense of our  own experiences and the context of our lives.   It is  only then that we can fully realize that real    'salvation  is human possibility resting in no one's hands  but our own.    in These Times  Roberta Lynch is a   national officer of the  New American Movement.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND    gt;  t4etou gt;*t4, o   a THMdte-aqed Sfaen  Can a middle-aged librarian find happiness on the ski slopes with all those  gorgeous young snow bunnies? Emphatically   And I proved it last winter while on vacation  in northwestern Wyoming.  When I confided to friends and co-workers  that I intended to go skiing on my vacation,  their response was amused skepticism, if not  open disbelief. I'll have to admit I had some  misgivings,   too,   and   resolutely   put  from  mind the remembrance of my  next-door neighbor's son who  had fractured  both legs at once  on a ski outing.  It did seem pretty  foolhardy for  someone my age  to risk life and  limb-for what  I  guess I wanted  to find out if   skiing is as great  as everyone says,  and maybe I  wanted to prove  jthat old adage   that  Age is just  if you don't  Barbara  Juday  a   case  of  mind  over  matter  mind, it doesn't matter.   A five-dollar bill rented me a pair of  boots, cross-country skis and poles, and we  were off to Pa ha ska Lodge on the outskirts of  Yellowstone Park. The magnificent landscape, over which a Christmas-card-type  snow fell, was incredibly beautiful. Unfortunately, I was so busy staying upright  as we trekked up a gentle mountain trail  that I didn't have time to record the scene  on my trusty Instamatic.  The first difficulty that I had not considered was the problem of breathing in the  rarefied 7000-foot atmosphere. I could  proceed only a short distance without huffing and puffing, and I had to stop constantly to rest and catch my breath. My  daughter seemed somewhat apprehensive  about whether or not I might have a heart  attack, but such thoughts were soon banished as I lost my balance and pitched forward on my face in the powdery snow. It  was impossible to get up it seemed, and  when I finally righted myself after a mighty  effort, it was only to have the same thing  happen numerous other times during the  afternoon. I varied my falls by going down  on my knees or sometimes flat on my back,  as well as face down.  Even the slightest inclines seemed to  defeat me, and I tended to slip backward  with almost every step forward. Finally I  decided I would just take my skis off and  walk up the trail. Although my daughter  cautioned against it, 1 slipped them off anyway and was immediately buried in snow up  to my waist   After plodding along a couple of miles,  we came to a summit in an open area with  slopes of varying degrees of steepness surrounding us. Not only was I breathless from  my exertions, but from the sheer beauty of  our surroundings. Snow-laden Douglas fir  and lodgepole pines ringed the open meadows  before us and there were craggy mountain  vistas on all sides. The partially frozen  Shoshone River gurgled below us and a  curious elk confronted my daughter as she  moved ahead of me on the trail.  Somehow, someway, I endured the afternoon's exertions, and it was a relief when  the sun began to sink and we headed back  for the comforting warmth of the lodge. A  hot bath soothed my sore muscles, and next  day my shoulders ached clear down to the  marrow-if that is possible. To my horror,  my son-in-law was already planning our next  outing--this time to include a party of  friends. I briefly considered pleading an  on-coming cold or sore throat, but when I  realized my daughter would feel obligated to  stay behind with me, I tapped some unknown  reservoir of courage and insisted that I  could hardly wait to ski again   By BARBARA JUDAY  Lo    On the second outing, I no longer had  to remember which foot to put forward.   All  of a sudden I was actually gliding down the  little inclines, and even the altitude didn't  bother me nearly as much.   I fell only twice,  and both times I was able to get up with a  minimum of exertion.  As the men went rocketing down what  they called  suicide slope,  I was content  to slide down the gentle inclines, remembering to bend my knees just like the skiers do  on television. The blue vault of Western sky  arched over us, the snow-laden evergreens  reached toward heaven, and somewhere in  the distance a coyote was howling. I  actually skimmed down the trail, and breathless with happiness instead of exertion, I  called back over my shoulder,  Look, kids   Ma's skiing    Vacation ended all too soon, and I could  hardly bear to come home. In the flurry of  holiday preparations, I had hardly looked at  the skiing books in the library's collection.  A little advance reading might have made the  first day's ordeal easier.  Ski in a Day by Clif Taylor (796.93) has  very clear instructions and good illustrations,  and Cross Country Skiing for the Fun of It by  Margaret Bennett (796.93) is a lively, practical instruction book which surely ought to  shorten   the   novice   period   for  beginners.  Another how-to book, The Cross-Country  Ski Book, by Johnny Caldwell (796.93) is  geared toward the person who has never  skied, as is Cross-Country Skiing and  Snowshoeing (796.93) by Erwin Bauer. A  special feature of this book is a listing of  cross-country resorts with complete information about costs, trails, and lodgings. One  of the big advantages of this sport, however,  is that you don't have to go to a resort (with  attendant high prices).  My introduction to cross-country skiing  convinces me that it has  everything -  invigorating outdoor exercise, a sense of  achievement and a chance to enjoy the  awesome splendor of the winter landscape.

Call 923-5615  Chubbiness and Related Problems  By PAT HEIDENREICH  If your first thought isnYuk  when you look into  a mirror... if you can't remember the last time  you crossed your legs... if you have given up girdles  because what does one more inch, more or less matter. .. you are probably a gal who has a Topsy bod  ... it just grew and grew, and therefore you are interested in fashions in larger sizes.  Now comes the problem... FINDING fashions in  larger sizes.  Have you ever longingly looked through racks of  clothing, finally came to the end of the grouping  and found that even the very largest sizes resembled  toy-dresses.  Have you noticed that 10 is the magic number.  Someone who wears size 10 has her choice of anything in the joint.  Have you ever had the urge, after waddling all  over town searching for something, anything to  wear, to stand in the middle of the store and bellow,  If you're a plump person, you might as well  drop dead I   (cleaned up for print)  Have you ever bought  fits all sizes  panty hose  and after pulling and puffing for 15 minutes, found  that your fanny was still uncovered and the crotch  was still somewhere down around your knees?  WIT/H  S6,OM6s*M  S1ZET TITS AILLI0.J   Do you begin a diet every Monday morning of your  your life?   All goes well, until you get hungry..,  usually on Tuesday.  Do you make resolutions in the bathtub, only to  break them in the kitchen?  Do you have a secret hatred for people who leave  three french fries and 1/4 of a hamburger on their  plates in a restaurant?  Do your kids ask you to move over when you're  lying on the couch, so they can share the space  and watch T. V. ?... and you hafta say,  I AM  over.     Getting a little paranoid about your  weight, eh?.   WELL;   THEN THIS COLUMN IS  DEDICATED TO YOU.  I remember before I weighed in at TOPS  meetings, I'd shave under my arms, brush my  teeth... ANYTHING to weigh less.   In fact, after  you've dropped out of Weight Watchers, Tops, Dr.  Stillman's water diet, Silhouette, a course on  self-hypnosis... you get the distinct feeling of  failure... I mean, what's left?  I know, I know...  you gotta be determined.  Anyway, as I see it, there are four immediate  solutions for us  chubby little rascals.   (that is,  until we loose our excess poundage)...  1. Waddle over to the bakery and perk up our  spirits with a chocolate eclair or two.  2. Visit the Tent and Awning Co. (never did  look good in stripes, though.)  3. Buy a pattern and try to make something  to wear.   Of course, you run the risk that the  family will eye the yards of material and ask  why you're MAKING the bed sheets now.  Shop at one of the few, I repeat, FEW   stores that do carry fashions in larger sizes  .. .Bless them    Onlookers can't understand  why I kneel down in front of every store I find  that carries biggies and bow my forehead to the  sidewalk.  One of the favorites with us mature figured gals  is pantsuits.   I once heard a fashion expert on T. V.  say that fat ladies should never wear slacks because  they look rotten in dresses, too.   The expert also  mentioned that darker colors are the most flattering in larger sizes (they don't call me  the black  panther  for nothing.)  Anyway, girls, it won't be long, til we won't  have this shopping problem... because we're gonna  get on that diet and stay on it... and this time we  really, really, really, really mean it, don't we?  Our battle cry will be,  Remember, a moment on  the lips, forever on the hips    Wow  all this writing about this depressing subject sure has made me hungry )

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  Spring Encounter      m mm A dKferent khd of rape   '      gSt   'l  -  f Tl 2 p '' *     Tnis is a txue story-     The author wishes to remain anonymous.  I sat beside Bill in the lecture hall while our  Biology 102 professor spoke in a monotone:   In the not-to-distant future, biologists will  discover a way for women to cease having a menstrual cycle.     I know a way already,   Bill whispered to me.   Sh      I silenced him.  Bill persisted.    It feels good, too.    Before I could respond, the two hundred some  students started to talk as they gathered their books  and papers to leave.   Vicki,   Bill said,  let's go for a ride.   My car's  outside.   You don't have a class for two hours.    I hesitated.   I was going to the library to study.     Don't you think I'm more fun than studying?   Bill challenged.   Much more fun,   I laughed.    OK then, let's go.    We didn't talk as we walked to his car.   Bill unlocked  the driver's side, I got in and scooted across  the seat.   Vicki, you're really going to like the fraternity  party Saturday night.   The pledges are putting wild  decorations in the house and planning some crazy  skits.   Paul got some hundredproof to put in the  punch.   Mom Jones will never know.     Bill, where are we going?  I interrupted.   It's a surprise.   I'm going to show you something  beautiful,   Bill answered.  As we turned off the main road, I realized he was  headed toward the estates of the University president.   Bill, this is no surprise.   I've been to Rolling Hills  Estates many times.    Just wait, Vicki.   I'm taking you to a special part  I bet you've never seen.    We drove through the lovely grounds until the dirt  road ended.   Now we walk,   Bill announced.  The short hike was delightful.   The blue sky was a  brilliant background for the hint of spring buds on the  trees.   Forsythia and wisteria painted blotches of color  on the hillside.   What did I tell you,  Vicki?   Isn't this beautiful?  I bet you've never been here before,    Bill boasted.   Yes,  it's my first time here.   It is lovely.    Bill squeezed my hand, kissed my cheek and then  my neck.   Breathing into my ear he said,   There's a  first time for everything.   Suddenly he kissed me on the lips.   His tongue  moved in my mouth.  I protested,   Not so fast, Bill.     Sorry, honey.    He backed off and said,  Let's  sit down and enjoy nature's rebirth of the world.    Soon he asked,   Can you see that pink dogwood  at the top of the hill?    Where?   Bill moved close to me, putting his arm around me.  With his hand, he turned my head toward the top of  the hill.   See? Up there,   he pointed.   No, I still don't see it.    Well, it doesn't matter.   It's there. And we're  here, sitting close together on the grass on a beautiful spring day.   Reminds me of love.    Again Bill was kissing me on my lips, my cheeks,  and my neck with such force that suddenly I was  spawled out on the ground with Bill lying on top of  me.   Stop, Bill   Don't    I don't want to,    I screamed.   Of course, you do, Vickie--you want this as much  as I do.   Just relax and enjoy it,   Bill crooned into  my ear.

I tried to get up, to get Bill off of me.   His weight  trapped me.   I felt his hands pull up my skirt.   Stop it    Don't    I don't want this.   You're hurting me. Stop     Relax, honey, it won't take long,   he panted.  I was crying as I pounded on Bill's back.   But he  didn't stop.  A few moments later, he grunted and rolled off  of me.  I was dazed.   I got up and started to walk away.  I hurt all over.   I couldn't look at Bill.   I started  to run toward his car.  So many thoughts flashed through my mind as I  ran:  Will I get pregnant?  THAT is sex?  He raped me, damn it    He raped me.   That  bastarc   God, I don't want to be pregnant.   Please God,  don't let me be pregnant.  How could he do that?  Where's his car?  I want  my purse.   Damn him   Bill caught up with me and grabbed my arm.   What are you doing, Vicki?  Are you crazy?  What's the matter with you?    Let go of me, you bastard,   I sobbed.   What's liie matter, honey? Bill cooed, pulling me close to him and stroking my hair.   It'll be all right, baby,   he said softly.    Was  that your first time?  I didn't realize it.   It'll be  OK.   I felt even more confused    What is going on?  He raped me, and now he's comforting me.   Am I  I crazy? He raped me, didn't he?  Why am I  standing here letting him touch me now?  Oh, I'm  so tired.   I want to be alone.   I'm all mixed up.   That's better, honey.   Just relax now and stop  crying.   Take a deep breath.   That's a good girl.     Bill, I might be pregnant now.   Why did you  do that?  Are you out of your mind?  I don't want  to get pregnant.    Oh, is that all that's bothering you?  Don't  worry, honey.   I can fix that.   Come on, baby,  get in the car.   I'll go get you something.    I got in and leaned against the door on my side.  I despised being in his car, but what else could  I do?  I kept minking--he is going to get me something so I won't get pregnant.   I don't want to be  pregnant.   Please, dear God, don't let me be pregnant.   Here we are.   I'll be right back,   Bill called as  he darted out of the car into a drugstore.   He returned with a small package.   Here.   This'U take care of everything.     What is it?  I asked,   Boric acid.    Boric acid    What's it for?  That won't stop  i me from being pregnant.    Sure it will.   I read about it.   Just douche  with it right away.    Right away?  How?  How much boric acid?  How much water?    Damn, don't you know anything? How should I  know? I got you the stuff. Now you use it however  you want to.   I was too involved in my own bewildered thoughts  to notice the silence on my way back to my dorm.  Bill stopped the car; he didn't turn off the engine.   You'll be OK. The first time can be upsetting.  Go douche, and then everything will be fine. I'll  call you tomorrow.    Sure,    I mumbled as I left his car.   I hoped  I would never see him again.

(Staff photo)  Indianapolis has become a learning place for  writers.   The Central Indiana Writers' Association  (CIWA), founded three years ago by Cheryl Denk  of Franklin, Indiana has made this possible.  Using the knowledge and encouragement gained  from CIWA Conferences and from monthly CIWA  meetings, several Indiana writers have realized  their dreams of being published both locally and  nationally.  Hoosier author (The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing) Marilyn Durham highlighted the third annual  Central Indiana Writers' Conference, held October  27-29, 1978, in Indianapolis.  In addition to Ms. Durham, who taught the  Fiction Writing Workshop, Dorothy Hamilton  from Selma, Indiana, was the instructor for  a Writing for Young People Workshop.  Fifty writers attended creative workshops, held by  various other well-known Indiana writers.  Marilyn Durham, wife, mother, teacher and  lecturer, began her writing career with the 1972  publication of  Cat Dancing .   The book became  a bestseller, with 15 foreig n printings to its credit.  Made into a popular motion picture, starring Burt  Reynolds and Sarah Miles it won Ms. Durham the  Society of Midland Authors Fiction Award for 1973.  That same year  Dutch Uncle  was published.  Ms. Durham is currently working on a third novel,   The Counsel of the Wolf.    Dorothy Hamilton, who published her first book  at age 65  in 1971, now has some 23 books in print,  mostly for children, with three more due out this  year.   They include:  Anita's Choice,    Bittersweet Days,      The Gift of a Home,    Mali's  Mountain,    Winter Girl,   and ' Christmas for  Holly.    Her adult books include:  Settled  Furrows,      The Killdeer,      The Quail,    and  The Eagle.   Ms Hamilton, who lives in Delaware County,  Indiana, is one of the founders and directors of the  Midwest Writers' Workshop held each year at Ball  State University.   She has taught numerous writing  classes and has published over 100 stories in newspapers and magazines.  The first CIWA conference was held in a church  building in Franklin, Indiana, and was partially  financed with  176 of Cheryl Dentfs money.   With  a grant from the Indiana Arts Commission, the  second (1977) and the third (1978) conferences were  successfully held.   The recent conference was also  supported by a grant from the National Endowment for  for the Arts.  CIWA membership is open to all writers.   Meetings  are now held the first Monday of every month at 7:30  P. M. in the Greenwood, Indiana Library. CIWA also  has a poetry circle, a monthly newsletter, and the  annual conference.   Yearly dues are  10,00.  To join or to find out more information contact  the new CIWA Director:  Leigh Tandy  922 Sleepy Hollow PI.  Greenwood, Indiana 46142  Who's B.O.S.S.?

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  11  Galaxia Women Enterprises  An album review of  Side by Side      by MARY PARIDO   Galaxia Women Enterprises  reaffirms the creative and powerful force engendered by women working  side by side  with their new recorded release:  Side by Side,   Reenactments of Scenes from Women's  History,  1848-1920.     This two-volume set chronicles the  first wave  feminist activity with a collection of speeches delivered by the leaders of the movement woven into the fabric of a thoroughly researched  historical narrative.   Galaxia's  wisdom is in letting these great women speak for themselves and in so doing, inspire  a  second wave  audience.   Along with headliners  Lucretia Mott,  Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth  Cady Stanton (pictured side by side on the cover),  one hears from less well-known activists such as  Lillie Devereux Blake,  Virginia Minor, and Paulina  Wright Davis.   The mood ranges from the clear,  incisive and inescapable logic of Stanton or Anthony  in speaking to matters of legality and the constitution  to the stinging satire of Blake in  The Rights of Men   or the deeply moving pathos of Sojourner Truth in   Ain't I A Woman?  The realization of sisterhood as  a diachronic as well as synchronic phenomenon is in  itself exhilarating.  It is especially gratifying that this tribute to our   foremothers  is produced by women who are trail-  blazers themselves in the recording industry.   This  second album of the young production company,   Galaxia Women Enterprises,  dedicated  to the  promotion of present and future women's culture,    refutes any accusation of non-professionalism.   The  extensive research and excellent writing of Linda  Lachman provides a narrative which lends continuity and serves as a firm basis for the more technical talents of engineer, Karen Kane and consultant, Deanna Lackaff, under the direction of executive producer, Annemarie Taylor.   The album cover  designed by Linda Mancini provides a concise history  T-SHIRTS ARE AVAILABLE  Colors: powder blue, med,  red, It. green,  gold.  Sizes: Small(32-34)  Med.(36-38) Lg.  (40-42) X-Lg.

Choose  of the period and introduction to the speakers in the  liner notes.   'Galaxia Women Enterprises' feels it is important to make women's heritage more accessible   and they succeed with this set which would be a  welcome addition to a personal library as well  as a valuable teaching tool in public school or  women's studies libraries.

I am also  an independent researcher who needs the help of  other women.   And having become familiar with  WOMANKIND, I believe that there are women (and  men) in your readership who can and will be able to  help.  When I was pregnant, I found little information  about the emotional changes which I went through.  And so I am gathering information about the emotional changes which women (and men) experience  'during pregnancy.  If you are willing to share pregnancy experiences  which you had, please write to me for a questionnaire.   (Indicate whether you want a questionnaire  for a father or mother or both).  Thank you for your paper and for helping me and  future pregnant women.  Very truly yours,  Susan A Holton, Ph.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  NOW's 1981 Conference  Photo/essay by Jeanine Rae  Bloomington, IN  Eleanor Smeal NOW president, opens the 1981  conference .  Supporters at the ERA rally hold a banner that sums it up:   How Long Must Women Wait For Equality.    The National Organization for Women (NOW) held its  National Conference October 10-12 in Washington, DC.  Despite the recent talk of a slow-down on the fight for  the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, NOW voted  to continue to pursue ratification with all the resouices  and woman and man power at hand , Work will continue  and grow in these area: the ERA Missionary Project, ERA  Message Brigade, and a nationwide media blitz.  /  n Good Times   television star Esther Rolle  wears her  Countdown to Equality   badge.     fciG   NATIONAL  ORGANIZATION  FOP WOMEN  Esther Rolle talks to the receptive and delighted crowd. Over  4.000 women attended.  Esther Rolle's presence at the Conference was evident. She spoke at several sessions, communicating  her continued support for the ERA. She sat with the  women; she talked with the women; she sang the   Ballad of the ERA  with the women.  Betty Ford and the stars and celebrities who attended inspired those who came to the Conference.  The 4, 000 women who attended were an inspiration,  too.  The National Organization for Women has a membership of over 150,000 women and men and is the  largest feminist organization in the United States  and is still growing.  Former First Lady Betty Fora and Ellie Smeal share the platform as they share their desire for the passage of the ERA.  Wm lmlhM  STAFF  EDITOR  Judith LaFourest  STAFF  Aunt Rae Brengle  E. K.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Feminist group forms in Poland  A group of women recently met at Warsaw  University in Poland to form a feminist organization.   They drew up a list of demands that  included maternity leave for students more  than 3 months pregnant, greater responsibilities  of men for child care and abortion, and equal  status under the law for married and unmarried  couples.   The group, hopes to publish a newsletter and to establish a women's theater and  gallery.   The new organization welcomes contact  with groups.   Contact Krystina Kowalewska,  Universvtet Warzawski, U Krakowski, Przedmies-  cie 24, 00-325 Warzawa, Poland.  Sex change surgery  not profitable  John Hopkins, the first hospital to do  sex-change surgery in the U. S. has stopped  doing it.    This decision is based on a study  that questioned the benefits of these operations.  The study found that those who changed from  female to male earned MORE money after  surgery, but most of the male-to-female trans -  sexuals; earned less money after their change.  Collective Clean Up  hi Scotland, cleaning women have organized  two collectives to fight high unemployment, low  wages and miserable working conditions.   The  women, ranging in age from 30 to 79, have set  their own wages and have almost abolished night  work .   The women said:   We know we were pretty  well exploited before, but now we're getting our own  back.   Take heart and do what we did.  Computerized Breast  Cancer Detection  Scientists in Japan have designed a new method  of breast cancer detection.  The device has 25  fingers, each equipped with its own gauge. The  gauges are hooked to a computer- As the fingers  examine the breast, they give the computer information so it can draw a picture of any lumps in  the breast-  Angry Women Protest  hi Brixton, London, angry women occupied  a local cafe after a woman was sexually  assaulted by the manager there.    Posters on the  outside asked people to boycott the cafe.   Trapping the staff inside.and giving the manager   one of the worst days of his life -   was only fair considering that is what he gave her,   said a spokeswoman  for the group (  Stop Rape Campaign  Two poster campaigns were initiated in Rochester,  NY after the rapes of seven elderly women.  First a composite portrait of the suspected rapist  was posted fc Then a fake proclamation by a fake  Department of Rape Prevention went up all over  town   The latter stated that a 10 PM curfew for all  men was in effect, The police were reported frantic  about the second poster .  from BIG MAMA RAG October 1981  In Indianapolis, a similar campaign was initiated  in October, A public notice with the mayor's seal  and an official Public Safety Emblem was posted  proclaiming an immediate curfew for men  in order to protect the safety of women and to prevent  further sexual violence.'1 Men on the street after 10  PM were required to be accompanied by two or more  women..  The group who put the posters up were inspired to  do this action by the motto on the Department of  Safety's logo: Crime Cannot Continue Unless the Community Condones It.  Police removed the 2000 posters..  Women Enjoy Relocation Chance  A study of 440 women executives indicates single  women are enthusiastic about opportunities to relocate.  And some married women managers think a geographical change is so important to career progress  that it's worth a long-distance commute to their  husbands.  The study was done by Boyden-Management  Women, a women's executive recruiting firm in  Connecticut.  Pro-Choice Vigil/Demonstration     byLAdpifiSWN  L to R: Betty Williams of Planned Parenthood  Pat Ulen of Indpls Women's Center, and  Jill Chambers,  Indiana NOW State Coordinator, (Photo by K. Niles )  Women, men, and children gathered in a pro-choice  demonstration/vigil in front of the Indianapolis Hyatt  Regency hotel on Saturday, Nov. 14,1981 to express  their right and the right of all women to choose to  have an abortion - - if an abortion is necessary and  desirable.  While the group chanted outside the hotel:  Women  have died because of Hyde  and  Not the Church, Not  the State, Women Must Decide Their Fate,   U. S  Representative Henry Hyde (R. Ill) of the Anti-  Best   One Act Plays by Women  The One Act Theatre Company of San  Francisco recently announced the five winning  plays from its national contest for Best New One  Acts by Women, sponsored by the Mortimer  Fleishhacker Foundation.  In first place was THE AUTUMN LADIES by  Susan Nanus of New York City.   Second-place  winner was FITS AND STARTS by Grace McKeaney  ofEvanston, Dlinois.   Third-place was DE CRESCENDO  by Lrene Oppenheim of San Francisco.   Honorable  mentions were CARE AND FEEDEMG by Denize  Springer and FIRE ESCAPE by O-Lan Shepard, both  San Francisco playwrights.  The three top winners were produced by the  One Act Theatre Company in A FESTIVAL OF  WOMEN PLAYWRIGHTS . which opened October  2, 1981.  WE RECEIVED OVER 500 MANUSCRIPTS  FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, said Michael  Lynch, coordinator of the contest.   WE'RE  GRATIFIED BY THE RESPONSE AND HOPE THAT  THIS WILL ENCOURAGE MANY MORE WOMEN  TO WRITE NEW PLAYS,  The finalists were selected by well-known  theatre artists from across the United States.  Zap ActionMembers Fined  Six members of the Women's Liberation Zap Action  Brigade were convicted on September 29th 19 81  and each fined  100 for  disruption of Congress.    The maximum sentence is six months in jail and/or a   500 fine.  During April hearings on a bill that would make abortion  murder,   the women held signs and shouted slogans saying   What about the lives of women?  A woman's life is a  human life,      and 'Ihis bill would put 1. 5 million in  jails, in hospitals, in fear.    (Approximately 1.5 million  US   women have abortions every year )  The bill, S   158 or the  Human Life Statute , would  put into law that human life begins at fertilization,  permitting states to pass laws making abortion.    IUD's,  some pills and amniocentesis crimes of murder.  After the trial, one juror said  a crime had been  committed,   to which one Zap member responded  that it is never a crime to say that a woman's life  is a human life,  The conviction is being appealed.  Five members of the Women's Liberation Zap  Action Brigade belong to CARASA (The Committee  for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse)  and one is a member of Off Our Backs, a national  feminist newspaper.  Abortion group was inside speaking at a fundraising  dinner for the so-called right-to-life group.  The dinner was sponsored by the Right to Life  of Indianapolis Inc., the Indiana Right to Life Lie.,  and the St.Gerard Guild and,Mother and Unborn Baby  Care Centers.  Hyde, author of the 1980 Hyde Amendment,which  prohibits medicaid payment for abortion is responsible for the removal of the right to choose for poor  women in this country.  Hyde's latest effort is to take away the right to  choose for all women. The HLA(Human Life Amendment) will not only make abortion illegal for ALL  women in ALL circumstances, but will eliminate  some birth control methods like the IUD and the mini-  pill. The Anti-Hyde   and Pro-Choice rally was sponsored by the Indiana National Organization for  Women. Other group s which participated were  Planned Parenthood, Catholics for Choice, and Dignity.  At a press conference, Mr. Hyde said he regrets  the 1080 amendment was amended to allow federal  funds to be used in rape and incest cases   for he  contends treatment to prevent pregnancy in such  cases could be received within 36 hours.  The Hyde protesters view the amendment as a  restriction on constitutional rights*   I want people to know that there are citizens  who believe in reproductive freedom . I'm not for  legislative bodies deciding what I should do in my  personal life -- my body is my own,   said Ruth  Reichard, associate coordinator for Indiana's  National Organization      One man said that  Abortion is a personal consideration to be made by the woman and sometimes  by the man involved'.'  One woman discussed the case of an 11 year old  girl raped by her mother's boyfriend.  At the end of the vigil all participants held lighted  candles and Michele Moscato, State Reproductive  Rights Chair for NOW, called for a moment of silence to remember those women who have died since  the withdrawal of medicaid payment for abortion      Homemakers Unite  HERA, Homemakers' Equal Rights Association, is  a national organization working to improve the legal  and social status of homemakers.    Its Initials spell the  name of the Greek goddess of home and hearth.   HERA believes marriage is a partnership between a  man and a woman, and that the government should  recognize that partnership by giving equal legal  rights to both spouses.   Homemakers and their families  suffer under antiquated laws that restrict women's  rights to sign contracts, to execute wills, to own,  manage,and will property.   Families suffer when wives  must pay inheritance taxes on our husbands' estates  or have no rights to their pension plans,   says Terri  Wedoff, HERA president.    As a homemaker, I  need a national guarantee of my legal rights,   says  Wedoff.    That guarantee is the Equal Rights Amendment which reads: 'Equality of rights under the law  shall not be denied or abridged by the United States  or by any State on account of sex,'   concludes the  HERA president.  The ERA has been ratified by 35 of the most popu -  lous states and needs to be ratified by three more to  take effect.  HERA is convinced of the need for this constitutional  guarantee of equality for the nation's homemakers.  If you are interested in being a part of HERA,  contact Ms. Terri Wedoff,  712 S. Kenilworth,  Oak Park,  E.L 60304.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  The Contessa of Firenzi  by CORDELLE BALLARD  West Haven   CT  Some war memories won't go away.    Horrors  which  leave a deep indentation are suppressed with no effort  because they are too disturbing to be contemplated.  Others reflect human behavior in transcendence of the  war agony. These memories can be recalled withi  admiration of the individual who  could rise above  the torture and take a stand in accordance with her  highest beliefs     I have such a memory of the  Contessa of Firenzi*  In World Warll the Germans pulled out of Florence,  Italy after blowing up all bridges except the Ponte  Vecchio, which they bombed at both ends,  in the  hope that the Allied armies would be delayed in  following their retreat,   Then the British and  American forces took Florence and I was with them  as a Red Cross worker attached to the American  Military Government , My job was to try to relieve  the distress of the Italian citizens in the war zone,  and at the same time keep them out of the hair of  the military while it concentrated on winning the  war'  In this way I got to know the leading citizens  of the city, and early on they got to know their appeals  and complaints would be funneled through the Red  Cross wherever possible.  Before arriving in the city, we had been briefed on  the stories brought by the Allied spies, of citizen  collaboration with, and resistance to the enemy      Many of the actors in this phase of the war drama now  appeared in the office asking for help or offering to  give aid to the Allies   Most were requests for  assistance to travel to places recently taken over from  the Germans, for aid in protecting property still in  the hands of the enemy, or for practical relief for  individuals in need of food, clothing   shelter or  medical attention.  A few came to offer assistance  to the conquering army because of their gratitude  for rescue from enemy oppression*  Generally these  were the anti-fascists; they were on our side-  The most outstanding individual in Florence, who  for years been known as anti-fascist and had been in  touch with the Allied forces through subversive  channels even while the Germans were occupying the  city, was the Contessa  Firenzi ,   She was  immediately made a member of the Epuration  Committee as she was clearly identified with  democratic principles     gt;  She helped to organize  civilian relief* Because of her knowledge and position  she was of immense help to the Military Government *.  She was active in the Italian Red Cross and worked to  relieve the suffering oi the common people wno needed  someone to speak for them* Many were in dire straits.  She knew what they nad gone tnrough .  The opportunity came for the Red Cross staff to meet  her, by invitation to one of her Thursday  At Homes   which she had carried on before and during the war   She  had continued to observe the custom,, and the Red Cross  staff felt honored. We wanted to see and talk with this  brave woman who had resisted persecution by the Germans and who had held steadfastly to her principles  even though her daughter was taken into custody by the  Germans and her life threatened. The Germans said  they would execute the Contessa's daughter if she  did not divulge information demanded by the enemy.  We knew the story; we wanted to become acquainted  with the person who had resisted such pressure.  Woman saves tree  A woman in Kingfield, ME, rescued a tree  near her house from state highway department  chainsaws b y climbing it and refusing to come  down. 31 year old Jill Royall finally consented  to descend from her perch after a town meeting  was called at her house to discuss neighborhood  objections to the felling of the century old tree.  1 MENOPAUSE, CHANGING ROLES, AND  THE JOB MARKET  ARE JUST SOME OF THE TOPICS  BROOMSTICK  A NATIONAL, FEMINIST,  READER-PARTICIPATION MAGAZINE  BY, FOR, AND ABOUT  WOMEN OVER FORTY   10 per year in US,  15 in Canada  Sample copy  2.00  BROOMSTICK  3543 18th St.  San Francisco, CA 94110  The Contessa had worked with the underground during the war and was instrumental in protecting and  housing Allied pilots who had bailed out or who had  been shot down over Italy and who were in danger of  being captured by the Germans   These men received  help from civilians and were secretly passed from person to person until they could be evacuated by the  Resistance out of the war zone- The Vatican, through  Monsignor O' Flaherty and his group, was able to save  hundreds of Allied pilots by means of a network of  underground assistance maintained throughout the occupied territory .The Contessa, as a key person in her  community and as a devout Catholic, worked closely  with the Vatican,  The Contessa's   At Homes  became rescue links in  this national network. The Germans knew of her work  but could not get specific information to use against  her i Then someone who had attended one of her Thursday gatherings reported to the German authorities that  some of the Contessa's guests were those implicated  in spying. With this bit to go on, the enemy cracked  down and demanded that the Contessa tell who was  present at this particular  At Home.   This she refused to do      Cordelle Ballard, Washington, D.C ,  1944, just before she went overseas for 27 months     Her daughter was then arrested on a flimsy excuse  and the mother was told that unless she gave the in -  formation required, the authorities would execute  her daughter. In jail, the daughter was told what  might happen to her and an effort was made to have  her influence her mother. Eventually the Germans  became convinced that the Contessa would not give  in.. They released her daughter ,  When I arrived at her home I was in a high state  of anticipation     I wondered if the stories we had  heard might have been exaggerated as they had  passed from mouth to mouth. The Contessa's  kindly acts, working with the Red Cross, seemed  to indicate a more pliable , sweet personality,  but her resistance to the enemy's demands proved  she had a strong wilh I tried to imagine how I  would behave under similar circumstances.  We were ushered into her old and spacious home 3  already peopled with guests. The rooms were furnished with beautiful antiques and valuable paintings* Polished silver shone in the subdued candle  light* We wandered through the reception rooms and  were offered wine and cakejThe person who was acting as host to our group gradually maneuvered us in   to the room where the Contessa was receiving.

When our time came, she shook our hands and immediately invited us to gather around her for a  chat. After some hospitable remarks and comments  on why the Red Cross was present  gt; she asked if there  was anything we would like to know from her; she  was ready to discuss anything we cared to bring upc  She was old and she had not risen from her chair.  She spo ke in cultivated English which she had  learned from her British governess t She was of medium height I guessed and she was somewhat gaunt, her  bony face wrinkled with age, But, her attitude was  as alive as that of a young but mature adult - Her  voice was soft-toned but strong t the movements of  her hands were quick, not sluggish  gt; and her eyes  commanded the surroundings. And it was her eyes that  held everything together and directed the social situation. In the subdued light they appeared to be dark  without coloro  I wish I could remember her exact words because  of their grace  gt; their accuracy and human consideration o We entered easily into a discussion of what the  people in Florence had endured during the occupation  and before under the Mussolini yoke , Eventually we  reached the question we wanted to ask of her.. Hesitantly one or another of us asked in oblique ways how  she had managed to resist the German pressure. She  told the story in a straight forward manner that included the authorities' ultimatum: she must reveal the  names of the people who had attended her  At Home   on a certain date or her daughter would pay with her  life.  Since she had always used prayer as a means of securing direction in making decisions, great and small,  she told us that night she prayed the night through*  Her anguish over her daughter's possible fate was  overwhelming - The need to protect those people working to overcome oppression also claimed her loyalty*  These thoughts came to her. She had given her word  to help the helpless and that could not be retrac ted      She had responsibility for the stand she had taken - No  matter what the enemy did she could not be relieved  of this responsibility,. She had to continue to live with  her beliefs no matter what threats were made against  her; her soul would be irretrievably damaged if she  gave in to pressure, even to save her daughter.  Her decision made, she told the German authorities the next day that they would have to do what  they willed as she would not change the stand she had  taken; under no circumstances would she give them  the names of the people who had visited her home -  The Germans were convinced she meant what she  saido Within a day her daughter was released*  I will always remember the Contessa of Firenzi'  Underwood   V Crexjubii c CP  otoqr p  ujo       Z3Z3 MMi*m  o     UidfO( .jU462D      /-J/7- 923S /S  ATTORNEY RECEIVES MOST DISTINQUISHED  Anne Wilcox, Indianapolis attorney, was honored at  The Indiana University at Indianapolis Liberal Arts  Alumni Association as the recepient of the 1981 Distinguished Alumnus Award.

City Nights  More swiftly now  than at noon  I walk  through the city's  empty streets  wrapped in  stiff determination,  protected only  by a fragile bubble  of confidence  built to spite  statistics.  Eight minutes  from locked glass door  to locked glass door.  The humid  night air is laden  with the fear  of those not here.  My multiplied shadow  beneath little incandescent  suns  brings apprehensions  not my own.  What nightmares  stalk this street  that were not here  at noon.  Will these shadows  of myself, somehow,  turn and rend  me?  More swiftly now,  though the shadows  keep their place,  the locked glass door  is nearer*  Muscles ache with tension  hurrying on to safety  from invisible dangers  met in every step.  That swaying tree,  only hours ago,  was a welcome touch  of breathing green  in a concrete world.  Now it seems to lurk  above the walk    I hurry, eyes fixed - -  the tree's nod of  familiar greeting  unseen.  The yeUow  divided rectangles  of light  through the locked  glass door  beckon, yet threaten  sending spirals of panic  twisting  through my battered brain*  Shelter within reach  the stalking monsters yet may  pounce.  Why lock a glass door?

Paperback  9.95.  by SUSAN RODDICK  Indpls, IN  Three Book Reviews  PULLING OUR OWN STRINGS by Gloria Kaufman and  Mary Kay Blakely. Ind. Univ, Press, Bloomington, IN  Paperback  7,95  Serious students of women's political and sociological histories will find Zillah Eisenstein's work, THE  RADICAL FUTURE OF LIBERAL FEMINISM, a well  documented piece.   The historical perspective adopted  by Eisenstein leads the reader to a broader conceptualization of the elements molding today's feminist movement      Using historical references, Eisenstein is able to  develop and support her strongly radical arguments .  The writings of John Locke, Jean Jacques Rousseau and  John Stuart Mills are exami led.   The contributions their  writings gave to the women's liberal movement rather  than their traditionally taught ideologies are presented.  For example, Locke opens the door to women's equality,  but stops short of an endorsement of women's equality  in the free market place.  The main thrust behind the author's work is the patriarchal bias of those writer's liberalism which while endorsing individual freedom fails to recognize that women  are in a sexual class system tightly held by the capitalist  economic system.  Using writings from historical liberal women leaders,  Eisenstein supports her argument with the words of  Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Mary Wollstonecraft whose  radical (for their time) thoughts advanced women's  rights, However, she also points to their liberalistic  ideology as a failing point.  Current feminist activist Betty Friedan is openly confronted for her liberalism.  Blasting Friedan's dismissal  of the sex class theory of power and her embracement of  liberal feminism, Eisenstein views Friedan as having a  narrow ideological stand which can't succeed in freeing  women economically or socially.   Eisenstein's own view  is that the state must be reformed, the patriarchal support  dropped,  Articulating the reality of the  sexual ghetto  and the   working mother,  Eisenstein points to the second class  citizenship as being marked clearly in dollars and cents.   Working mothers'  are referred to as  double-day  workers,   which because of male attitudes make women  maintain usual family services without aid from their mates  and because of her economic status receives substandard  wages.  Radical political ideas presented are documented and  logical, however the author's major flaw is her needless  and constant reference to the  bourgeois  class.   Time  could have been spent better expanding her last two  chapters which deal with the radical ideology facing  women today.  by J   SUE WAGNER  Indianapolis, IN  For all the prune-faced  old boys  wailing their  dismay that feminists  have no sense of humor ,  PULLING OUR OWN STRINGS will come as a shock.  Page after page of splendid humor refutes the charge,  but last on the editors' agenda is any defense of  feminist funnybones/   Kaufman and Blakeley have  more importantly appreciated the absurdity of the  ordinary in women's lives and returned it to us in  clear, sharp, funny cameos-   PULLING OUR OWN  STRINGS is a family album featuring those moments  we didn't think anyone was looking, or if looking,  would understand.

NY, NY,  1.75 paperback  by JUDITH RAE  Indpls, IN  How does an eleven year old adjust to her  family's annual move?   What's it like to always be   the new girl  in school?   What thoughts dart through  a young girl's head as she stands in the crowded  lunchroom holding her tray, hoping someone will  beckon her to an empty chair?  How does a pre-  teenager deal with parents who constantly give  platitudinous advice on how to make friends?  ANYTHING FOR A FRIEND covers these and other  questions which are important and more common  in children's lives today.  Wallis, who is usually embarassed over explaining  the origin of her name, feels desparate to make  friends .  She is so desparate that she takes part in a  cruel joke on a fat girl in the class.  Ellen Conford, author of six other books for young  people, sweeps the reader through an exciting plot  with realistic, lively conversation and vivid descriptions:     My parents looked over my head at each  other. My father shrugged and looked helpless.  My mother poured another cup of coffe, and  gulped it down, like a drunk who's been off  the sauce for weeks.'  Conford's purpose, presenting a story that includes  children's fears, thoughts, and frustrations of both  moving and making friends, is reached in an entertaining and often humorous way.  The thesis, developed throughout the book, culminates in Wallis's realization that she can make  friends wherever she lives and that she - - not her  parents or the kids at school - - is the maker of her  own happiness.  This message, one that adults can also learn from,  is only part of the significance of this volume.   The  book is important for two other reasons:   1. It's a  model for girls who are still bombarded with books,  television, teachers, comics, and relatives who perpetuate the image of girls as passive watchers of  boys - - the doers, the actors .  Besides eliminating stereotyped activities, the author  includes positive, non-sexist behavior in the characters.   For example, when Wallis and her friend Stuffy  both arrive at school early, the teacher does not  limit a request for physical help to the boys:  'Good morning    You certainly are the early  birds today    Maybe one of you would open a  few windows?  It's pretty warm in here.'  The inevitable boy-girl interest of pre-teens is not  not excluded, but is given a subordinate role .  Rather than having Wallis put all of her energy in  getting a  boy friend,   she merely smiles to herself when Arthur gives her two new pens to replace  old ones she lent him *  Along with achieving her purpose in writing this book,  Conford teaches about relationships. For example, we  learn much about the warmth between Wallis and her  grandmother in dialogues such as this one:   I'll make up my own mind, yes, Grandma.  After I think about what you said    She (Grandma) shook her head, but there  was a little smile on her lips, as if she couldn't  help it, even if she really didn't feel like smiling.  She grabbed me by the shoulders and squeezed  Hard. (Gramdma really doesn't know her own  strength.)   You're my granddaughter, all right. There's no  doubt about that  .   I think that's fine, Grandma, don't you?   She(Grandma) grinned   I rubbed my shoulder*   (Reviewer's parantheses)  Because I feared a  Happily ever after  ending, I  was relieved to find the resolution to Wallis 's problems  not in a neatly, tied up package of answers but rather  in the discovery of internal security which would assist  her in coping with all future happenings .  Both boys and girls will eagerly read this delightful  work     And if they give it to their parents afterwards,  moms and dads will better understand the difficulties  children face when having to move and/or make friends.

        <pagetext>Outing at Island Park  by  ANDREA SCHOENTHAL  Wellsviile, New York  The last time the children and I came to Island Park,  we came with Jim.  It was a mild Saturday in February. Eleven year old  Allen grabbed his winter things and ran outdoors to  watch the melting snow run down the curb in front of  our house.   That of course led Marcie, his eight year  old sister, into wanting to go out, too.   I remember  adjusting the hood of her jacket over her long, straight  hair - - hair I love to brush, hair the color of jonquils,  hair the color of her father's.  That was when Jim entered the front room carrying my  winter jacket and my warm boots in his large hands.   How about if we make a family outing out of it?   he asked.    Let's take a walk over to Island Park.     The park in the winter?  Marcie asked.    What can  we do there now?    Oh, I don't know,   Jim said, grinning down at his  daughter.    We'll see.    Then he turned to me and added,   Should be beautiful today. Coming?   The afternoon sun-dazzled snow made us squint and  blink as we walked along the Wellsviile streets.   The  cloudless pale blue sky was the same shade as Marcie's  eyes.   Tiny droplets of water dripped from the icicles  which shimmered on the metal screening that covered  the footbridge leading across the Genesee River into the  park.   Ice clogged the small creek and the fairly large  river which surrounds the park on all sides.  Our son, Allen, stopped in the middle of the bridge to  peer into the water.   He couldn't see any fish swimming  below; there wouldn't be any frogs to catch.    What  kind of a dumb idea was this anyway?  he muttered.  Jim led the way  through the snow towards the playground, undaunted by Allen's grumblings.   Allen hesitated a few more minutes, then darted on ahead until  he caught up with his father.   Soon he was walking beside Jim, matching long-legged strides, making almost  identically-sized boot prints in the snow.  Marcie and I stumbled along behind; our shorter,  fleshier legs, our smaller feet couldn't keep pace.  When we finally reached the playground, we were  breathless from our exertion.   Marcie looked around  her.   Most of the playground equipment had been  stored away; snow covered the sandbox.   Joining her  voice of protest with her brother's, Marcie made it quite  clear what she thought of her father's bright idea.  I felt sorry for Jim, thinking how disappointed he'd  be if the outing turned into a disaster as it was clearly  threatening to do.   I should have known better.   Instead  of arguing the children's protests away or getting upset  over them, he knelt down in the snow and began to  gather large, ungloved handsful of snow around him.  The wind blew through his unruly mop of blond hair,  causing several wavy strands to fall onto his forehead.  He was too intent on his task to notice. The children  gathered close around to see what he could be up to  now, as he slowly molded the snow into shape.   Hey, look   Allen cried, dropping down on his  knees in the snow.    It's a frog    Daddy's making me  a frog    Allen began to work alongside his father while Marcie  and I stood by and watched.   Then Marcie  tapped Jim on  the shoulder.   When he glanced up at her, gazing up into  her round face with his piercing blue eyes, she announced  that she didn't want a frog, she wanted him to make her  a snowlady.   A snowlady you say?  I think we can manage that.    He looked above Marcie's head, up at me.   A wide  grin spread across his face, revealing the dimples in  his cheeks, the laugh crinkles in the corners of his eyes.   We have the perfect model for our snowlady standing  right there,   he said.    Let me see.   We need lots of  snow for the top, oh, I think , a little less for the middle  but we'll need lots and lots and lots of it for the bottom.   I grabbed a handful of snow and threw it.   He ducked,  the snow landing safely on the ground in front of him.  I stamped my foot in mock anger, and then all of us  began laughing together at once.  Ten days after our Island Park outing, Jim died from  injuries sustained in a car accident. For five days he  had been hospitalized after crashing his car into a bridge  abutment a few miles from our home- He had been on'  his way to the hospital lab where he worked. An ice  storm had made the road treacherous.  On this April morning the children dash past the spot  where their snow sculptures stood and I remember and  wonder if they are remembering-   Move over,     Allen demands, standing below the monkey bars, glaring up at Marcie.    There's room.     This is my spot,  she argues.    You go find your own  spot to play.   When I come near, they stop their squabbling immediately, as if in accordance to some agreement between them.  Allen steps back, leaving the perch to Marcie as she requested.   He decides to go play in the river, frog hunt until lunchtime.   Watching him run off across the park through  the spring grass, I marvel again as I have marveled before  on how tall he is.   Then I glance back at Marcie, thinking   How much like their father both of the children are.    They have his height, his shoulders, his fair skin tones,  his large, expressive eyes, his small face.   About the only  thing Marcie and I have in common is our plumpness and  Allen has only inherited one thing from me,  my dark  brown eyes with my dark, thick eyebrows and lashes.   Mommy, please push me on the swings.   Real high.  Like Daddy did.   After a few minutes, Marcie, the swing and I become  united in a rhythmic motion.   Since there's no need to  concentrate on my actions, I gaze beyond the flying  wooden swing across the gravel playground to the  interior of Island Park.   Dew -covered spring-green leaves  sprout along the limbs of the maple trees.   The huge,  thick oaks are covered with tightly-closed yellow-green  buds.   A clearing beyond the picnic area is often used for  summer Frisbees.   Jim and the children threw snowballs at  each other in that clearing when we were here in February.  I fight the tears, reminding myself as I have done so often  these last few months that I mustn' t cry in front of the  children.   It is hard enough on them without witnessing my  despair.   You're not pushing, Mommy.     Oh?  I'm sorry.   Is this better?    Yes, That's good.   Isn't it pretty here, Mommy?  she  asks, turning to smile at me.    Isn't the morning pretty?  Aren't you glad you came?   I haven't been out of the house before noon in two  months.   After the children leave for school or go out  to play, I climb back into bed to sleep as much of the  time away as possible.   The house is a mess.   The  children have grown tired of T. V. dinners.   Marcie  grumbles every  chance she gets about the food and  about all the chores I have left undone, chores she and  Allen often try to do for themselves.  It is twelve o'clock.   Always punctual, Allen runs  over to us from the river to announce that it is time  to eat.   Then he and Marcie hurry off together to  select a good picnic spot beneath the largest oak tree.  Marcie*s round face is soon the picture of intense concentration as she munches on her sandwich.   Allen  holds his forgotten sandwich in mid-air, a far-away  look in his brown eyes.   You sure are deep in thought,   I say.   I was just remembering,   he says in a voice barely  above a whisper,  this winter, when we came here  with Daddy.   I was remembering the frog.     Daddy ,   Marcie mumbles, laying her sandwich aside.   I miss my Daddy.   I wish he didn't have to die.     I know, princess.   I wish he didn't have to die, too.  I wish so badly that he could be with us now I... I....    For the first time since Jim's death, I have said the  word  die  in front of my children.   For the first time,  I have let the tears fall down my face and they don't  fall apart as I feared they might.   They don't collapse  because of my grief.   They seem relieved.   We are all  relieved and openly admit to each other our grief and  the gaping hole in each of our lives.  Minutes pass, the children study my face, wordlessly  waiting for an answer, a solution.   We must go on without him,  I explain.  It's that simple  and yes it's that difficult, too.   There is nothing else we  can do.   We must hang onto each other and go on.   There  is no other way to survive.   Allen nods, picks up his sandwich, begins to eat.  Marcie blows her nose on a Kleenex and sips her  Kool-aid.   After lunch me and Allen's going frog hunting together,   she says.  Then we're both going to climb  on the monkey bars.     That sounds like fun,  I reply.   And you, Mom,   Allen asks,  what are you going  to do?    Take a little walk down by the river.   Watch you frog  hunt awhile, do some thinking.   Have to plan some things  for our future.   And then, well then.. .how about if I join  you guys on the monkey bars?   They laugh at the absurd picture of their mother  climbing around on monkey bars.   I laugh with them.  It feels so good to laugh again and I'm glad we came  to Island Park today.  From My Journal  by ANONYMOUS  I was born into a home where hatred and violence  had overtaken any love or joy that once might have  lived there.  My mother was a vital, active woman who wanted  more from life, but didn't know how to get it, and  even if she had known how, it wouldn't have mattered;  there was never a way out for her. She really didn't  want children or the responsibility they brought, but  because of faulty birth control methods and my father's  demands, my mother gave birth to 12 unwanted  children*. The children, the unbearable poverty,  and  my father's cruelty turned my once-vital mother into  a living mass of misery full of hate and revenge.  My father was an alcoholic and a sadist. He was  truly sick;this was proved numerous times by courts  and psychologists, but his mother (my grandmother)  would always buy his way out* She would rather deny  his sickness than see him get mental help* He never  worked.  He'd beat my mother and take her check and spend  it on whores. Then he would come home and rape my  mother. She usually got pregnant. Then he'd leave  and get   someone else pregnant. When he was home,  he'd beat his children relentlessly. Mostly, he beat  me because I loved and protected my mother. When  I tried to protect her, the rest of the kids would run  and hide because they were frightened, but I just  couldn't.  Blood would fly everywhere. He'd hit her with anything that was close at hand. He was merciless. There  was a frantic pleasure in his eyes and in his laugh and  I hated him with all my being. I wanted to destroy him,   He's going to kill her,   I'd think, and I'd scream.  Then something would happen inside my head; it was  like my brain snapped and I'd be so strong, stronger  than him even.   Sometimes I could throw things  through the air that I couldn't even budge before.  I'd hit with these things, and beat him frantically  and I couldn't feel anything, not his beating me,  not my head bleeding, nothing.  All I could feel was  the hate I had for him and my desire to kill him.  Sometimes I couldn't remember what had happened  or what I'd done.,  Once when I was about six, I busted his head open  with a large iron ashtray that I normally couldn't lift.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  BOARS?  It  Just Doesn't  Show  by  PAT  HEIDENREICH  Why does it always happen this way?  You just finish scrubbing the kitchen floor and  cleaning the bathroom when you discover you're  out of eggs for the evening meatloaf. So you  comb your hair, wipe your face on a towel and  dash down to the local supermarket. While you're  there you decide to pick up some beer for your  husband and as you shuffle up to the check-out  counter, carefully balancing the eggs on the six-  pack, you run into someone you haven't seen in ages*  It's usually someone you used to work with back in  the years when you looked like a fashion plate, or it's  someone from the weight-reducing club that you  dropped out of.   Since then, she's lost thirty pounds  and you've gained sixty .   Golly, it's great to see you again   you lie.    Tell  everyone I said Hi.    And all the way to the car you mutter obscenities.  You can just hear the reports:    Boy  has she gone to  seed- Really turned into a frump    And besides, she's  drinking now, poor dear    Anoxher thing- - why is it unexpected company  always finds you and your house looking like  (censored)?  You really try to keep the joint in  shape and 85  of the time it doesn't look half bad,  but no one comes then  I take that back*   One time I did have a visitor  just after I had cleaned     I remember it was one of  the greatest joys of my life   I snickered for days  afterward    The kids thought I had finally cracked -  Everytime they looked at me I was snorting softly,  my shoulders were hunching up and down and my  lips were frozen into a sly triumphant grin-  Even the Avon lady always comes at the wrong  time .   And she looks so great - ..her hair, her  clothes, her make-up .   I know she must wonder  what 1 do with all the eye-liner, perfume, fake  lashes and lipsticks I order.    (They're in my top  dresser drawer. )  Ah yes, life is cruel.   Deep down inside you  know how you really are, a great person . But  why is it that other people get the wrong impression so often?   You feel like shouting,   Hey  this  isn't the real me     Well, there's one solution to this problem,  Always look your best and always keep your house  in perfect order.  I tried this for awhile.   I put on make-up,  combed my hair - - the kids kept asking,   Where're  you going?   I kept the house immaculate.    Who's coming?   they'd ask    I decided the whole thing was unnatural.   I went  back to being a slob -   I just hope that people realize  that deep down inside I really am a great person.  It  just doesn' t show.  7461 W. 10th Street  Indianapolis, Indiana 46224  ffi-  Residential  Commercial  Farms  HOMES  c?KC.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Meg Christian at WOMANKIND  by NANCY BROOKS  Indpls, IN  The mother of women's music looked a little road  weary when she visited the Womankind Center in  Indianapolis for a press conference.  As Meg Christian settled into a chair, she reached  for a throat lozenge from her backpack and began to  reminisce about the beginnings of the women's music  movement and Olivia Records.   I 'd go out with my manager and Olivia's first product,  45 records stuffed in the back of a Toyota wagon with a  cooler full of food and 18 gallons of wine and we'd go up  and down the East coast. Today, because of costs we've  decided to try driving again instead of flying and I'm  enjoying it     I have a Winnebago with my name in glitter on the side-,  says Christian/ smiling.;   We're having a wonderful time, except that we're  doing almost more media than concerts.   And I'm  learning that it's just as tiring to do media as it is to  do concerts.   A major reason for this tour is to promote her new  album,     Turning It Over , of which Meg Christian  is justifiably proud.     I wanted it to be as truthful  and beautiful as it possibly could be,   she states  firmly.  At a time when it could be easy to be careless,  Meg Christian makes it evident that she's an artist  who cares about her work and about her reasons for  making music.   She's an established  star  in the  national feminist community with ten years' of  laurels that she could rest upon.   But Christian keeps  growing     both personally and musically.  At Labyris, the women's bar in Indianapolis,  Christian sang two generous sets and her audience  listened in the sort of silence which bespeaks something  very special.   The women's faces and their laughter  and their tears were what  Christian had been talking  about the week before at Womankind:   I come from the Bay Area and there's a tremendous  amount of support there for non traditional alternate  ways of doing things.   And I get spoiled*    Then I go  to a place and feel what it's like to have a women's  event there. . It is moving.   Because it gives me an  even deeper sense of how important is is to be doin'  it.   What it means to them.    What it means to all of  us-   It is important for the whole ten years that I  have been doin'  it.  And particularly these days when  woman-hating is growing out there.   I'm feeling as I  travel everywhere that the need for these opportunities  for us to be together in a safe place and provide support  and nourishment to one another is very strong.     The way that I really like to perform and write  songs is to feel what is inside of me,   what needs to  be said, and write it..., that's the way I write best.  When I get to writing from my gut, I don't have a  choice.   And I hope I never lie in a song and I hope  that it's always as real as it can possibly be.   What  I've found from doing women's concerts is that it's  safe for me to share that because every single time I  share it, 99 per cent of the audience has experienced  the same thing in one way or another.    That's what  it's all about to me.   That's what the Women's  Movement and other groups have done for me.  It is not surprising to discover that just as Meg  Christian sustains us with her music, we sustain her with  our response to her.   And that the sustenance comes  from the knowledge that we are  all in this together.     I think that's what it's all about,  says Christian.    We  don't have to do anything alone anymore.    And we can  survive anything they throw at us.   ADA AUGUSTA BYRON  (LADY LOVELACE)  1815-1852  by MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  Indpls,  IN  In the early 19th century, Ada Augusta Byron(Lord  Byron's daughter) met Charles Babbage, the now acknowledged Father of the Computer. Ada Augusta Byron was a widely recognized mathematician: she was  as well known for her mathematical and engineering  genius as was her father for his poetical genius.  Byron's daughter joined Babbage in a lengthy, happy  collaboration, working first on his  difference engine   and later on his  analytical engine. Both of these inventions would have worked, but for the unreliability  of steam power and the impossibility of acquiring precision parts.  Even after her marriage in 1835 to Lord Lovelace,  Byron(now Lady Lovelace)contributed her time and talent to Babbage's inventions. Her interest, however,  was not altogether altruistic: Lady Lovelace had a predilection for gambling. She hoped that Babbage's  machines would someday help her beat the horses*  Although no credit for the invention is given her,  her assistance and her encouragement are noted She  wrote a commentary on Babbage's Analytical Engine  that was well received and she is mentioned as a  scientist in some texts  (A biography has been written  about her-)  Ada Augusta Byron  was a pioneer -woman in the  field of applied mathemathics.

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  Information /Update on Carol Ann Wilds  BACKGROUND  Carol Ann Wilds, an inmate at the Indiana Women's  Prison in Indianapolis, filed a sexual exploitation suit  against the IWP officials and the state of Indiana in  April, 1981.  Wilds gave birth to a son in August 1980 while incarcerated      (Her story, in her own words, is available in Issue 18  and an update in Issue 19.)  Send  2 to receive both  issues;  1 for one of them .  After you have read these issues   (and we hope you  already have), send a letter of protest to Indiana's  Gov. Robert On and request that a Citizens Committee  (with members of the original Blue Ribbon Citizens  Committee) visit the women in prison and investigate  the problems there, with the HELP of the governor's  office and all those involved .  Write to: The Honorable Robert On  State Office Building  110 N. Senate St-  Indpls, IN 46204  OTHER PUBLISHED ARTICLES  Articles about the Wilds case and related issues have  recently appeared in OFF OUR BACKS (a reprint of  the article in Iss.l7),the SOUTH BEND WOMEN'S  NEWS,  and WOMEN SOURCE. The latter which is  published in Bloomington, IN gave an overview and  an up date and covered the talk Judith LaFourest gave  in that city on September 16 concerning sexual harassment and exploitation of women in prison      The LIBERATION NEWS SERVICE evidently included this story in their service although we have not  received a copy to validate this nor did we authorize  the story.(Please advise LNS when you read this)  The story is copyrighted and you must receive written permission from the publisher to reprint.  Wilds story in its many forms has been covered  nationwide via United Press and Associated Press  gt;  and many other papers in Indiana have done special  stories about the prison problems as they pertain to  women.  Exceptional coverage and continued coverage has  been done by the FT- WAYNE SENTINEL and the reporter, Dan Ludzadder. The city of Ft- Wayne knows  more about the Indiana Women's Prison than the people of Indianapolis -  More will be written and reprinted as evidenced by  the letters that appear below ;  Thank you for exchanging publications with ours.  I recently received two issues,   including Issue 18 of  1981 which contained a front page piece written by  Carol Ann Wilds, which intrigued me.  I am wondering if it would be possible to reprint her  article in part (I think I'd have to edit it for space a  bit) and whether I could borrow the front page picture  taken from a TV (most effective ).   We can pay for  the story and pay you for use of the picture, or at  least to cover postage for sending it.  If we could reprint it, naturally I would credit you  and your paper (give name, address, subscription  costs and mention you as the editor) and would give  the defense fund info, and address at the end of the  story.  Please write me as soon as you can so I can know  whether to plan on it.   I think it's a very valuable  article and an outrageous situation for women  prisoners.  Sincerely,  Annie Laurie Gaylor  Editor /Publisher  THE FEMINIST  CONNECTION  We are interested in writing an update to the Carol  A. Wilds' situation and she referred us to you.  Any kind of update on Carol's situation would be  greatly appreciated.  In Struggle,  Bobbe Ross  Collective Member  BIG MAMA RAG  Denver, CO  MATRIX is interested in printing Carol Ann Wilds'  story in its next issue .  I wrote to Ms. Wilds and she said it was all right  with her, but that I should also write to WOMANKIND.  She said that you might also send an update .  I have approached a local Men Against Rape Group  and asked them if they could make a  25 to  50 contribution to her defense fund. They should be making a  a decision at their meeting this week.  I recently visited you in Indianapolis at the  WOMANKIND CENTER and I enjoyed meeting and  talking with you. I was inspired to see women taking  stands together in my home city     With the Power of Unity  In Sisterhood,  Beth Harris  Olympia, WA  SUBSCRIBERS  Representative of the many letters we received requesting copies of WOMANKIND  that contain the  Wilds' story ;  I would like an individual subscription to your  publication.   Will  5. 00 cover the story by Carol  Ann Wilds as well?  Cynthia Riley  Chicago, HI  Al per our phone call, please send me a copy of  your issue on Carol Ann Wilds to begin my subscription to WOMANKIND.   Am looking forward to reading itl  It sure is good to talk to someone else who is out  there  pitching',1  Sincerely,  Marjorie L. Smith  Greensburg, IN  Blue Ribbon Citizens' Committee  Two members of the Blue Ribbon Citizens Commitee  visited James Bell Yager, the Executive Director of  The National Prisoners Rights Union, at the Federal  Correctional Institution in Oxford,  Wisconsin recently..  Sharon Graham and Judith LaFourest were impressed  with the attractive facility and the relaxed atmosphere  of the visitors'area and the many vocational opportunities that are evidently available for the incarcerated men there.  In comparison, the Indiana Women's Prison in Indi-  apolis seems like a facility of the 1940's or 1950's  especially in attitude.  This meeting finalized plans to bring into existence  an organization that will be called the United Women's  Legal Service for Incarcerated Women, Inc. Papers  are being drawn up now to make this organization a  reality.  Yager intends to get the organization going  then  it will be run by women primarily.   The NPRU has  previously had a Special Division for Women.  The new organization will have its offices in Indianapolis, but will be interested and in contact with all the  women's prisons in the United States gt; Visits and inspection tours are in the planning stages at other fa   cilities*  My Journal    continued from page i  When I woke up, I was at the end of mom's bed. In the  living room, there were cops everywhere.   An ambulance  was outside, the other kids had come out of hiding and  were huddled together crying in one corner of the front  room.   Everyone was talking and asking questions and  my mom's voice sounded hysterical.   I heard her ask  repeatedly,  Is he dead?   I was dazed.   It was like I  wasn't really there.   I felt like I was on the outside  somewhere looking in.  When I wandered into the front room, everyone looked  at me and it got quiet,   This frightened me.   Mom ran  over and held me,   What's wrong, Mom?  I asked.    Are you all right?   I cried and clung to her.   I sensed something terrible  but I didn't know what it was.   I was terribly afraid my  mother was going to disappear and leave me alone in  this nightmare,   I began to cry.  Then I saw my father.  Peering over my mother's shoulder, he was all bloody  and dead looking.    They were hooking bottles and  tubes up to him and rolling him to the ambulance  gt;      He's dead,     I thought.   I stopped crying, but felt  numb all over.   Darkness, I couldn't breathe  .... again  I blacked out.  Later, when I awoke my mother told me I had knocked  my father out with the heavy ashtray, and then I wouldn't  stop hitting him.      I had kept screaming:    I'm going  to kill him  and  He'll never hurt us again.    Someone  helped pull me off of him.   Mother said I was gasping  like I couldn't breathe and I passed out and one of the  cops, who had now arrived, had put me on the bed.  My father was in the hospital for a while*   He had a  concussion and I' m not sure what else.   Mom and I  also had to go in for stitches and head X-rays.   There  were many times like this, but this was the worse  time for him.   He put my mother in the hospital  several times.   While she was there nd at other times  too, my brothers and sisters had to take care  of ourselves and each other.   We each had two sets of  Goodwill clothes that we had to wash by hand every night  so we could wear them clean the next day. We seldom  had new clothes.  Dad always took mother's regular pay check. He didn't  buy clothes nor groceries, so Mom and I cleaned rich  people's houses and did their laundry and ironing to at  least buy food     But, sometimes there were weeks when  we had little or no food and when there wasn't enough,  Mom and I wouldn't eat.  I was hospitalized for malnutrition twice. None of  the other children were. It probably would have happened  to Mom, too, but the women she worked with shared  their lunches with her.  My mother worked at Western Electric so there was no  reason for our terrible poverty except for my Dad.  Four of his children died. Four were given away for  their own good and protection. One was raised partly by  my grandma.   Three were raised by me.  The one thing I know for sure, that I've always known,  is that when I have my own children, they will never see  such things, they will never go hungry or lack for love  and understanding, I want to be as prepared as possible  for them both mentally and financially. I want my children to have good memories and a heart full of love and  happiness  I know all too well how an unhappy mother and a lazy,  drunken, sadistic father can affect children *  esther fuller  consultant to women  in business and the professions  assistance establishing new business or making new businesses more profitable  p.o. box 314 zionsville, in. 46077   50.00  per hour 317-293-1612      i  Great  Cfi  Feminist Journalism   Our 11th Year  * National and international news  about women  * Thoughtful commentaries, and  news ahead of its time  * Health, prison, and labor news  SUBSCRIBE TODAY   oob, 1724 20 St. NW, Washington, DC 20009   7/year sample copy  1.00  For All Your Printing Needs     Typesetting     Artwork     Brochures      Menus     Carbonless Forms     Stationary     Envelopes     Numbering      Wedding Invitations     Business Cards     Labels     Programs     Gra  duation Announcements     Posters     Certificates     Plaques     No  te Pads  Greeting Cards     Buttons     Bumperstickers     Imprinted  Matcb  l Napkins     Newsletters     Design Work     Catalogs      Boc/7rt  ':      nstats     Stapling     Folding     Padding     Cutting      For All      Bro  s  N  '6236 Linda  Lane      Indianapolis,  Indiana  46241     Bum  (317)241-7565 (317)291-9337     .

One day at lunch I heard the football coach say  That girls shouldn't play sports because they might  Injure a breast, and after, he said,  Motherhood  is more important than football ,  And I was disappointed because I didn't realize  That a woman had to have two breasts, or even any,  To be a mama - - I just thought they were there so  Somebody could get  some ,  And I thought all I had to do to be a mama was to  love a child.  I heard a story about a man,  I once worked for-who couldn't keep his hands off me,  And it was said that he went home for lunch everyday  To get him some, and his little boy saw him, and later  On one afternoon, the little boy's mama saw him doing  Something to an old doll, and she called  Noel, Noel,  What are you doing?   And he replied   I'm getting some , and his daddy thought that was fine,  His mama cried.  A student of mine told me once about a movie  In which Lee Grant played a forty-year-old woman  Who couldn't get enough,   You know, like all  Forty-year-old women,   the boy said, as if he knew,  And I thought  About all the  humorous  comments that students make  now and then  About grumpy teachers who must not have gotten any,  And I want to tell them that the truth is  I'm grouchy because somebody got some last night,  But it wasn't necessarily me just because I was there,  And I should tell them that sometimes what you      t  Tun s c ut to be what you don't get after all,  But they wouldn't understand yet,  And most of them never will*  CLASSIFIED  Woman-identified jewelry to delight one and all   Send two 18c  stamps for brochure:  Jane Sipe --  Jeweler, P.

I told my cousin in LaPuente, California about the  paper and she would like a subscription.  By the way, I received my first issue today, enjoyed  it very much.  Thank you for taking the initiative to do some  thing that has been long needed.  Thanks Again,  Linda Hanger  Indpls. IN  The poetry page of WOMANKIND is an inspiration. It  conveys thoughts we've all had in fresh ways. It inspired  me to send to you three poems.  It would be rewarding if any of these were chosen for  publication.   If they are not published, I would appreciate  any comments.  These poems grew out of my experiences as a wife,  stepmother, teacher, musician and human being.  Cordially,  Janeice Petersen  Washington, DC  Editor's Note:   See verse, page 5.  I have just read my first issue of WOMANKIND and  I enjoyed it very much.  Many women, like me, are isolated geographically  economically and socially from national women's  affairs, A magazine like this creates visibility as well  as a network for local communication among women,  Sincerely,  Linda Faris  Dunkirk, IN  I am interested in setting up a feminist  poetry group through the Womankind Center.  I received the Center's newsletter and came  alive when I saw BUDDING IDEAS AND REAL  POSSIBILITIES because I have wanted to become  involved in a feminist poetry support group for  sometime now and feel that this is a good time.  Would it be possible to use the Center to meet?  I think one meeting per month would be suffi   -  cient, perhaps on a Sunday afternoon or evening,  I know the schedule at the Center must be very  busy, but if there is space on a weekend, I  would really like to facilitate such a group.  Do you think this is a real possibility?  Please  let me know.   I would like to have the first  group get together in November.   Thank you  for your consideration.  In Sisterhood  Leslie Jacobs  Connersville, IN  I have just received, read, devoured my  WOMANKIND issue  19.  I am a professional storyteller and saw all sorts  of humorous possibilities for entertaining people in  Martha Eubanks' story  Belden's Legacy.     Would  you grant me permission to use Eubanks' story on any  taping I may have the opportunity to do in the  future? I will, of course, give Eubanks credit as the  author and also give a well-deserved plug for WO  MANKIND itself.  Your mission with women is wonderful.   Wish I  lived closer so I could make use of the office space  and the bookstore     Keep up the good karma.  In Sisterhood,  Kathe Materich  Pulaski, WI  iiaiii  ill.

I tried to  shorten the poem you liked -- let me know if it's  any better.   Also included two other poems which  you might like.  What would help a lot is a copy of WOMANKIND.  Would you be good enough to send me one?  Thanks.   I'm looking forward to it, and to your  comments on the revision.  Best.  Deborah Reich  Flushing, NY  Editor's note: See page 5.

        <pagetext>A Bi-Monthly  Literary/News  Publication  PAST       PRESENT    FUTURE  Guest Editorial  by REBECCA E. PITTS  Indianapolis, IN  It appears not unlikely that the publication of WOMANKIND may have to be suspended - tor a time, at least, and it may be  permanently. Since this journal has won a  real place in the affection and respect of  most of its subscribers, contributors, and  supporters, it seems appropriate here to comment on the situation which has created this  threat to its survival.  It should be stated bluntly and clearly  at the outset, that, beneath all the subterfuges and legal technicalities(with respect to partnership and the sharing of  space at the  WOMANKIND CENTER ), the underlying issue is the attitude of a splinter  group who now call their purpose  Womanspace.   WOMANKIND was established in 1977, the  first issue appearing early in July of that  year - long before any members of this splinter-group had appeared on the horizon.  Its editor and founder, Judith LaFourest, was -  and is - a committed feminist in the  genuine, classical sense of that important  word. Genuine feminism is the heir of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Sojourner Truth, Lucretia  Mott, Susan B. Anthony, and Alice Paul.  It  is broad in its purposes, militant when it  needs to be (as when doesn't it need to be?),  and inclusive of all women, not any special  variety of women.  First, therefore, let us be clear about  one thing. Genuine feminism is not   homophobic  - a term Judith's adversaries  have been throwing at her, bitterly, of late.  Based as it is on the concepts of equality,  freedom, and sisterhood, genuine feminism can  never deny to any woman the right to participate in the struggle for women's liberation  and full equality with men.  It cannot,  therefore, exclude, or wish to exclude, any  woman from the feminist movement because of  race, creed, or personal life - choices.  It  recognizes the fact that as society is now  organized, many women cannot find fulfillment  of their needs and potentialities in traditional roles; and that some of them, at least,  may find happiness with other women.  But second - feminism is for all women.  Inevitably, therefore, no minority segment  of womankind can rightfully claim that it  and it alone is  feminist.  Such behavior  is divisive and wrong.  It is not without  ironic significance that the misguided  splinter group(alluded to above) frequently  calls itself, in its news-letters and publicity, the  Feminist Connection.  We know  all too well what  the French Connection,  or   the Mexican Connection,  means in terms of  criminal trafficking in drugs and other illicit and anti-social commodities. Unconsciously, perhaps, these women  recognize that their behavior of late is a  crime against womankind - a crime in that  they are trying to seize for themselves alone  the WOMANKIND CENTER, which for nearly a  year has been growing into a real community  center for all women and their friends and  husbands, and a resource center for women and  their professional and intellectual growth.  Third - and most important - real feminism  is deeply social in its purposes and ultimate  meaning. It is committed to the best interests of humanity. At present, to be sure,  CD  Ul  X)  o  3  -P  u  O  -4- gt;  0   c  CL  mere  human liberation is a meaningless term -  coined to de-fuse our enthusiasm and determination to fight for justice. But that  is possible only because the words  women's  liberation  have never yet been taken seriously enough.  Actually  freedom  and  liberation   are in thems'elves empty and dangerous words  unless we know what we want to be liberated  for.  Sometimes one gets the impression that  what both  straight  and  gay  women are looking for is mere sex-gratification. But no  serious feminist in the past, and no serious  feminist today - from Ellie Smeal to  the housewife, mother, or friend of women -  can really believe this. As feminists we are  committed (or ought to be committed) to the  releasing of 5255 of the creativity of humankind. This is desperately needed today, as  humanity races toward the disasters which a  patriarchal, male-dominated culture has  been preparing for us all - for women, men,  and their children. The very earth needs to  be saved - and the beautiful web of natural  life which a ruthless greed is destroying.  Our polluted air and water need to be cleansed  again, so that the children of the future may  not be malformed by birth defects.  There are many good men devoted to these  causes, but there can be no doubt that if the  concern and intelligence of caring women were  Contents  Beyond the ERA    2  International Women's Network     10  DeCrow vs. Schlafly    3  Racing Women    8  Introducing Mon  Chat Elaine    11  Book   Review  6  Verse       5  released, the outlook would be much more hopeful.  It was with such a concept of what feminism  means that Judith LaFourest founded WOMANKIND. She knew very well how women's minds  and souls can be dwarfed by isolation in the  so-called  nuclear family  - and especially  by the sex-role stereotyping imposed on us  all by patriarchal society and its educational  tricks. She also knew how, subtly or brutally,  women are discriminated against by magazines  and publishers, and how much they need an  outlet for self-expression and self-development. So her only rigorous exclusion was  that WOMANKIND should never publish  anything by male authors - not that she was  against men (she is a devoted mother and wife)  but that she wanted to give full encouragement  to women.  In this respect WOMANKIND is  one among many new magazines dedicated to the  creation of a strong sense of women's  history and women's potentialities.  It is,  however, one of the best of these magazines,  and in five years has developed a strong  local, national, and even international  readership. Part of this growth, of course,  has been due to the breadth of its interests  and appeal.  In fact, it is not merely as editor that  Judith LaFourest has shown the breadth of her  feminism. She has carried a message of hope  and sisterhood into the Indiana Women's Prison,  where she has championed the cause of those  women who have been sexually abused and otherwise mistreated by guards; and she has spoken  Continued to Page 4  WOMANKIND  371 1 N.

At  Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. they  will help launch the national campaign for  BEYOND THE ERA     a vigorous political  program to implement egual rights at the  state and local levels.  The concert is sponsored by the National  Women's Conference Committee. Established  at the National Women's Conference in Houston in 1977, the NWCC exists to implement  the National Plan of Action, the product of  the consensus reached by 140,000 women in  56 State and Territorial meetings and the  delegates they elected as a representative  body of American women to meet in Houston.  As the officially created watchdog organization that has monitored and encouraged the  fulfillment of that plan, the NWCC is  especially distressed to see it now dismantled plank by plank. From Arts and Humanities  to Welfare, not one of the resolutions in  the National Plan remains unscathed.  In the face of the assaults on the rights  of women, the National Women's Conference  Committee brings together representatives of  over 35 national women's organizations to  renew their commitment to the National Plan  of Action for Women.  Tickets for the concert are  10.00,  available from all Ticketron outlets and by  phone at 202-626-1000. For general information, call 202-223-0039 or write National  Women's Conference Committee, P.O. Box  50412, Washington, D.C. 20004.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Phyllis Schlafly, a member of the Illinois Bar,  national chairman of   Stop ERA,  the author  of The Power of the Positive woman, and a syndicated column, mother  of six children.  Women   on   the Role  of Women  DeCrow vs. Schlafly  On April 8, 1982, the Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI)  Progressive Student Union and the IUPUI  Women's Student Caucus sponsored a debate between Karen DeCrow(ERA proponent and past  president of the National Organization for  Women(NOW) and Phyllis Schlafly(national  chairwoman of STOP ERA.  (Schlafly prefers to be called chairman). The debate was  entitled  Women on the Role of Women.   The format was well planned as both women  had been mailed a set of questions prior to  the debate.  The audience filled the 500 capacity  Lecture Hall and spilled over into two adjoining rooms where the debate was viewed  over closed-circuit t.v.  The atmosphere was surprisingly controlled  and civil although there was some laughter  and an occasional groan or hiss to Schlafly's  remarks. She drew laughter from the crowd  when she mentioned a woman being  queen of  her home.   Phyllis Schlafly took her standard anti-  ERA position.  'The women's lib movement has created the battle between the sexes, with the 'notion' that we live  in a male-dominated society.   Children are better off growing  up to believe in the differences  between men and women.   Conferences in Britain Held  On January 10, 1982, over 200 women  attended the first National Jewish Feminist  Conference in London, England.  The day was organized by some women from  t. .e London Jewish Feminist Group which  has been meeting for over three years now,  providing a space for Jewish women (mainly  involved in the Women's Liberation Movement)  to look at how being Jewish affects our  lives, to act against anti-semitism and in  solidarity with other oppressed peoples.  Women from all over the country attended the ronference, despite heavy snow  which had b.ought the railways to a halt.  And  On January 30-31, 300 women met in Manchester, Great Britain, for a national  Women's Liberation Conference on Male  Power and the Sexual Abuse of Girls. The  impetus for the conference came from a  Feminists Against Sexual Terrorism meeting  the previous summer, where great  concern had been expressed over the lack  of real discussion and action in the Women's  Liberation Movement around the issue of the  sexual assault of girls by adult males whom  they know and trust.  from off our backs April 1982   Money is the root of all evil...and every  woman needs roots   from The Boise, Idaho NOW Newsletter, April  1982.  Karen DeCrow, a New York  Constitutional lawyer who  has worked for many years  to achieve equality between the sexes and who is  past national president  for the National Organization for Women (NOW)  by MARY M. MAH0N  Indianapolis, IN.  photo by M. Osborn'  If we want more women elected at the  polls, we have to get rid of all  this excess baggage of the  feminist movement.   Schlafly wore a pink, very feminine,  in great-grandma's sense of the word,  suit with matching scarf. Her open toed  shoes sans galoshes went well with the suit  but not the Indiana weather--rain and snow.  Schlafly seems to love the fight for the  sake of the fight. But, what appears at  first glance to be spunk, or  guts  as  she faces certain negative reactions, upon  further inspection seems to be more of a  martyr act to draw sympathy to her position.  Schlafly conveniently ignores the past and  future implications of the women's rights  movement. She chooses to forget that her  own successes, such as being a woman allowed to practice law, being a woman allowed  to be active in politics, or even being  allowed to have an education, are hard-gotten  rights, earned by the women's movement through  the years.  She also doesn't care to consider  what good effect the passage of the Equal  Rights Amendment might do for her own daughter  or grandchildren.  Perhaps this denial of what other women  have done is partially the passivity of  wealth.  Schlafly, largely due to her husband, is a wealthy person. She maintains  that  American Women are the most fortunate  people in the world today  (and she is.)  Schlafly bases this on a favorite premise of  hers that women have so many choices available to them: motherhood, careers, volunteer  work, and part-time jobs. She chooses to  overlook the fact that the majority of women  today don't have these choices, due to the  economic depression, the rising divorce rate,  and single motherhood. Phyllis Schlafly  looks at life and its situations from a standpoint of wealth and privilege   definitely a  minority viewpoint.  Schlafly views freedom as being taken care  of by  someone.  She sees marriage as a bargain between the provider and the privileged,  and she is happy with the trade-off.  I got the impression at the debate that  Mrs. Schlafly doesn't care much about the  quality of men's lives, either. Men, to  her, seem more to be used than enjoyed as  equal human beings. She also seems to think  that humans in general are not capable of  conducting themselves with integrity and  civility without a lot of definpd boundaries.  Schlafly also endorsed the  Moral Majority,   which dropped her many points in my book.  Thomas Jefferson said that if you give up a  little freedom for a little security you will  soon have neither one. Schlafly doesn't seem  to place a very high value on freedom.  Underneath it all, I think Phyllis Schlafly  has a very low opinion of women in general.  There is a definite undercurrent running  through everything she says that tells me  that, after all, men are superior to women.  This woman has great personality and drive.  It is a real shame that she cannot let herself be honest and open-minded enough to do  some real good for women.  Karen DeCrow, on the other hand has a  very high regard for the quality of human life,  be it male or female. She also is pro-choice,  and believes that passage of the Equal  Rights Amendment will insure this freedom of  choice for all persons.  DeCrow impressed me as being extremely  well prepared for the debate. She spoke  calmly and thoughtfully and said a lot within her time limits. She didn't seem to feel  a need for showmanship.  DeCrow read from Schlafly's book,  The Power of the Positive Woman,   Women don't take naturally to the  search for the intangible and abstract.  Where men are discursive, logical  and abstract and philosophical,  women tend to bo emotional, personal,  practical or mystical.  DeCrow cited  herself, the moderator and even  Schlafly as immediate examples to  refute that statement.  Dressed in a tan suit and navy blue top  with simple shell earrings and beads, De-  Crow also wore tan almost-to-the-knee boots  in keeping with her common sense. (Her plane  had been late landing due to Indiana's snow/  sleet and fog.)  Also, DeCrow was prepared for her opponent.  She seemed to have read everything that  Schlafly ever wrote, and challenged her  on her own ground, quoting from Schlafly's  own books. This was very impressive.  DeCrow seems to be a well-balanced person, able to listen to all sides of an argument and make intelligent judgments.  DeCrow used a baby comparison survey to  back up her premise that all persons are born  equal. Her concept of equality seems to stick  closely to the definition of the word, as  opposed to Schlafly's concept of interchange-  ables. DeCrow believes that equality of  women and men under the law(ERA) will make  for a much happier, saner society for all persons, regardless of gender.   Men should not be the wallet for women,   DeCrow stated, receiving immediate applause  from the audience.  A women's place is:  everyplace.   DeCrow made the point that putting equality  into the Constitution will cause people to  actually have to face the issue of equality.  She doesn't believe that individual good  will and high ideals will ever really change  society. She cited equality for blacks and  abolition of slavery which had to become law  before these concepts were taken seriously.  One of Schlafly's selling points has been  that women should not have to suffer the hardships of being in the military. DeCrow agrees  but also says that men shouldn't have to,  either. She argues that men and women are  equally responsible for their survival and  quality of life, and for insuring that life  for their children. She says,  Someone is  not put on this earth to give up his life for  someone else simply on the basis of sex.   DeCrow believes that the death of either  a young brother or sister in a war would be  equally tragic, therefore, men and women  should be equally treated in regard to the  draft.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  DeCrOW VS. (Continued from Page 3)  Thus young women as well as young men should  not be drafted nor go to war, but if 19 year  old men are drafted 19 year old women should  be drafted also.  DeCrow believes that the reason for the  high divorce rate and the physical abuse  that women endure is that  men and women are  raised as different species.    The most damaging discrimination,  is not obvious. It is the separation of boys and girls, which teaches  children at a young age that the  opposite sex is the enemy.  The hope for the future is in  ending the battle between the sexes,  and creating a world in which men  and women are friends and colleagues,  not enemies.   On the whole, the audience of women and  men listened carefully and asked sincere gues-  tions. There were a number of men at the  debate, which said to me that the issue of  eguality is of concern to all thinking  people, not just a small bunch of dissatisfied women, as ERA opponents and Phyllis  Schlafly would have us believe.

And as editor, she has recognized that there are several legitimate points  of view on the issue of abortion - or  rather  choice.  But she has never forgotten  the basic feminist issues: the plight of the  single parent family, for example, which in  actual fact is almost always the plight of  the working mother who is either a widow, or  a deserted wife, and who struggles alone at  the poverty level; the fact that home-  makers and elderly women - single or widowed -  are terribly discriminated against in this  country; and most important of all, the fact  that on an average women earn 59 cents  for every dollar earned by men of egual training and for comparable work.  The topic of  gay liberation  and its relation to the feminist movement has been rarely and lightly, touched on in 'WOMANKIND; but  this is due to the silence of the contributors  rather than to the editor's lack of sympathy.  In addition it may be noted that many  lesbians are not feminists nor or they for  the ERA. Many believe that the alliance between the women's movement and the cause of   gay  liberation has had an unfortunate  effect on the struggle to ratify the ERA.  It is a cruel irony that the experience of  the national women's movement has been repeated  on a smaller scale - and not so small at that,  in its repercussions - in the experience of  Judith LaFourest and WOMANKIND. After nearly  four years of successful growth, the magazine  needed for its production more space than its  cramped guarters could afford; and the editor  made an intensive search for a better location.  A friend who happened to be her personal  physician offered her a large and beautiful  house for sale on very lenient terms. This  fact is of great importance: it was Judith  who found the house; and it was Judith whose  local and national reputation subseguently  attracted most of  the friends and supporters  who helped furnish it, and who found tenants  for the offices and apartment which were to  generate enough income to keep the  WOMANKIND  CENTER  afloat.   p*    *,  WELL5PRING  3711 rlSfierman (317)5 2-0228  If you would like a copy of a newsletter  concerning the recent developments of the  WOMANKIND CENTER and its past  history, send an SASE and we will mail you  a copy.  In other words the entire venture of the   WOMANKIND CENTER  would have been impossible  for most women to launch; and the value of  Judith LaFourest's contribution (what is  called  good will  in the business world) has  been variously estimated, but always at far  more than that of the  down payment  on the  house. It is the sad fact, however, that although she could have mortgaged her home and  made this initial payment, she entered into  a partnership, and made a contract, with a  woman whom she did not know well enough.  An attitude of overt hostility and contempt for straight women and for most of  men who have come to the WOMANKIND CENTER  has increased. In the last few weeks this kind  of behavior has not only made such guests uncomfortable  systematic policy of harassment  has culminated in a lock-out and then lock-in  of one tenant, who has since moved. Judith  herself was denied free and full access to a  building of which she is co-owner.  Workshops and seminars have had to be cancelled, and other rent-paying tenants  have decided to leave. As a result of these  outrages - the lock-out of the tenant and of  Judith was clearly illegal and was terminated by the sheriff - Judith La Fourest  has, much against her will, brought the  whole matter into court.  The outcome is still very uncertain, but  no matter how the verdict goes, much of the  potential value of the CENTER has been lost;  and the fate of WOMANKIND itself is in the  balance. It is to be hoped that at this  juncture many friends of the magazine and its  editor will show their solidarity with genuine  feminist goals in whatever way they can.  Please note that this article is this  writer's observations and comments about the  situation at the WOMANKIND CENTER and should  be viewed as such.  ABOUT THE AUTHOR  Rebecca E.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  5.  Early Sunday  At dawn-thirty, the backyard patio,  Misty-cool with unevaporated dew,  Waits for the household to come alive;  Whispers of breeze tease the sycamore-  Ruffle mauve feathers of a wary dove,  And   growing stronger     Iron the lawn into velvet carpet.  An amiable squirrel,  Crashing a party of cheeky jays  (Strutting blue-jacketed  In pre-breakfast anticipation),  Bids for a share of stale raisins,  While the sun inches...creeps...and  Relentlessly climbs into a fresh morning.  by MADOLYN JAMIESON  Clearwater, FL.  Part of a Circle  I live in an aging house  with three other  females.  Sometimes I have the kitchen  all to myself.  Other times I can linger in the bath tub,  but not often.  I envy people who have  their own apartments/houses.  I also know these luxuries,  like stamps and money,  will fade away.  Photographs and Avon samples  clutter my dresser drawers.  A spider keeps me company.  I stare out the window at  nothing.  When I look in the mirror  I no longer recognize  myself.  Perhaps you don't either.  Perhaps you prefer to think  I am a mirage  a figment/distortion  of your imagination,  a strange figure  from the other side of the universe  who presses into a small space,  compact and quiet,  who dies without fanfare  extracted from the light you left  burning,  but perhaps you have forgotten  that you  go with it.  VERSE  Daughter of Culture  Down all the long white hallways and around  all the slippery corners and behind all  the layers of glass and under all the  perfectly folded blankets I lie weeping and  screaming.  While you prop yourself up in bed to converse  with the learned doctor     Not about me, Mother. Not about the meaning  of baby me  But about the meaning of Balsac, Kafka, and  Henry James.  In the home you brought me to my pictures  got tacked onto bulletin boards or dripped  dry and wet on cellar walls  While Chagall floated over the kitchen table  and van Gogh, 3 feet by 4, meditated  over the well-dusted piano.  You hushed my improvising and smiled resigned-  ly at my sonatinas  And whenever I arrived home, whatever I  arrived home from,  Beethoven from your instruments always greeted  me on the porch stairs long before you did.  Twenty years later, my poems flutter in your  bottom drawers or languish in photograph  albums.  While Emily Dickenson poses on the front book  case and Virginia Woolf stares into your  bedroom, surrounded by wide mat and gold  frame, and Neruda rests thick and soft  by your bedside.  Mother 0 Mother, someday I swear:  I will get my poems between hard covers.

        <pagetext>6.  WOMANKIND  Book Review  THE CHILDBIRTH PICTURE BOOK by FRAN HOSKEN  60 pages  (See ad below)  by PAMELA SCHROCK  Fran Hosken has, for many years, been  actively  speaking up for women's health  in  WINS, Women's International Network News.  Her newest venture, The Childbirth Picture Book, was recently published in both  English and French, with a Spanish version  in progress.  It provides basic information  to teen-agers and adults on the important  reproductive functions of their bodies, from  reproductive development,       .'.trough menstruation,  fertilization, pregnancy and lactation.  Except for six pages of beautifully sensitive photographs of mothers and babies, all  the illustrations are superbly executed by  medical illustrator, Marcia Williams. These  remarkable, simple line drawings (with  faces of different ethnic groups) capture  with graphic accuracy the developmental  growth of the young girl through womanhood,  the male reproductive organs, impregnation,  fertilization, embryonic development through  pregnancy, nursing, and family planning.  Though simple, the pictures are highly  informative. Standing on their own, they  are capable of clarifying the complex processes of human reproduction and childbearing  so that their comprehension is within the  reach of everyone. A flip-chart of the illustrations will soon be marketed. This will  be an added asset to health educators, teachers, or parents.  The easy-to-follow accompanying narrative  is presented in a concise, non-judgmental  manner, and it is well-suited to persons with  even minimal education.  Of particular interest are three pages on  nutrition in pregnancy and during lactation,  graphically demonstrating food varieties needed to maintain optimal nutrition, as well as  the need to avoid cigarettes, liquor, coffee  and non-prescription drugs.  Unusual  positions of the baby  are shown within the  body of whole persons, unlike the usual  graphics that only show the fetus in relation  to the pelvis; and here, at last, twins are  included within the complete picture. The  variety of birthing positions, the options  for expulsion, the involvement of physician,  midwife, supportive partner, or woman  birthing on her own, are all included concisely and unemotionally.  This wonderful book has a most interesting  glossary. Unlike most that I have seen, this  glossary includes a small line graphic drawing next to the word and its meaning, to aid  understanding and to clarify misconceptions.  The Childbirth Picture Book is one that I  enthusiastically recommend. It will be useful  for sex education of people of all ethnic persuasions, all socio-economic groups and educational levels, whether childbearing or not.  The resources are comprehensive for teachers  and clients alike, but the superior graphics  are and excellent testament to the saying,   A picture is worth a thousand words.

MA 02173    USA  A Letter from Catania  From September through mid-March, I  traveled Illinois, calling for passage  of the Equal Rights Amendment and advocating that human rights issues have a  prominent place in state government. My  opponents were George Ryan, Speaker of the  House of Representatives, the candidate of  Governor Thompson and Phyllis Schlafly;  and Donald Totten, a far-right state  senator backed by Nixon-supporter W. Clement  Stone and the White House.  A coalition of people who care about  human issues emerged around the campaign.  More than 1,000 people throughout Illinois  opened home headquarters. Hundreds of  NOW volunteers aided in canvassing.  Mario Thomas narrated our TV ads. Fifty-  one newspapers endorsed me and our issues,  including the Chicago Sun-Times and St.  Louis Post-Dispatch.  (My opponents  divided 20.)  On March 16, I won 33  of the vote,  Ryan 4355, and Totten 2455.  On March 17, I pointed out at a press  conference that  The members of the all  male Republican slate had better take a  more aggressive stand for the Equal  Rights Amendment if they hope to win in the  November election.   On March 18, Governor Thompson's press  conference revealed that the message of the  voters had not been lost. He praised our   excellent campaign,  and told a statewide  audience,  it is my hope that ERA will be  ratified in Illinois; I will work to the  limit of my power to see that happens.   With your support, we have forced ERA to  the front of discussion in Illinois. With  your further support, we can move forward.  I have enclosed our campaign finance stats  ment and an editorial commenting on the  uphill battle women still face.  In several weeks, I will return to the  Illinois House to hold Governor Thompson to  his public promise.  Thank you for your generous support.  Sincerely,  Susan Catania  State Representative  Chicago, IL  In Memory  Simultaneous ERA marches and rallies  were held on Sunday and Monday June 5 and 6  in Tallahassee,Florida; Springfield,Illinois;  Raleigh,N.C.; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Tens of thousands participated in these  four key unratified states climaxing a massive campaign for the Equal Rights Amendment.  The people in each state have indicated they  believe the Amendment should be passed.  INDIANAPOLIS WOMEN'S CENTER .

Wilds Gives Up  Carol Ann Wilds, Indiana Women's Prison  inmate, dropped her sexual harassment suit  against the Indiana Department of Correction in April, saying she was tired of the  fight.   .I'm mentally and physically drained,  Wilds said.  Wilds was convicted at Evansville, Indiana on a second-degree murder charge for  shooting her husband, Gary, while he was beating her. She was pregnant at the time.  Wilds has been incarcerated since 1977.  Wilds attracted national attention in  April 1981 when she filed the federal suit  charging that guards and employees forced  her to have sex with them by offering her a  guarantee that she would be given an early  release if she complied. She also received  money and preferential treatment. She became a  sex slave to prison personnel,   her suit said.  Wilds became pregnant while assigned  to the Westville Correctional Center in  northwestern Indiana. She gave birth to a son.  Three guards were fired, one transferred.  WOMANKIND published Wilds' story in her  own words in a front page story in Issue 18  and has continued to support her efforts  for over a year.  MOVING SOON?

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  To Withdraw or ....  by NANCY COSPER  Portland, OR.  My idea was to withdraw as much as possible  from frenetic city living, politics and world  affairs.  My husband, year-old daughter and I came to  Oregon from California where he had been as  assistant director in the motion picture  business and I had been a first-grade teacher.  We bought 10 acres of land in beautiful woods  of Douglas fir and maple, bordered by a  river. We moved into a converted school bus  where we lived without electricity or running  water as we cleared land and began to  build a house.  We hoped to raise our children in a simple,  clean environment.  My adjustment to these changes was not easy,  but I knew it was what I wanted to do. I  planted a garden; changed my diet by exchanging meat, sugar, and processed foods for fresh  vegetables and whole grains; learned to can  and preserve food; cooked and heated with a  wood stove; and cured illnesses with herbs  gathered locally.  The beauty and rhythms of my environment  began to captivate me, teaching me how to  see and hear in new ways. An even greater  reward came in discovering that I had become  self-reliant.  I also began meeting with a group of  women to buy food cooperatively, share child  care and discuss women's issues. A floundering support group grew from these gatherings,  but real opportunity came when the departing  owner of the local bi-weekly newspaper asked  if we women wanted to carry on in her place.  It was, for me, another beginning.  In early March, 1976, friends in a neighbor  ing rural valley sent us a copy of their newsletter. Their lead story concerned the practice of herbicide spraying by the Forest Service, and the health hazards that practice engendered. We began to wonder if the same practice wasn't being put to use in our own Forest  Service district.  It didn't take much investigation to discover that the watershed above my property  was one of several hundred acres scheduled for  herbicide treatment that spring. So much for  my idea of clean, quiet living.  I may have been detached before, but the  threat of herbicides in my water quickly  changed that. Publication of the next issue  of our newsletter served to activate many  people who shared our concerns, and we alerted  many groups who were beginning to follow suit.  Through the newspapers we were able to track  one another's actions to stop the spray program, pass on updated information, support  one another's successes, and avoid duplication  of effort.  This network evolved into the Northwest  Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides  (NCAP), a group instrumental in bringing  about the review process by the Environmental  Protection Agency of dioxin-containing herbicides.  As I became involved, I examined my own  life and relationships. Even though I was liv    ing an  alternative lifestyle,  my  husband's patriarchal attitudes constrained  my growth within the context of my marriage.  My openness to new experiences became such a  threat to him that I eventually had to leave.  I no longer live in the woods. I have  come back into a major metropolitan area in  Oregon (Portland), brought here by my understanding that we cannot withdraw; that no mat  ter how peaceful it may seem, there is no  place that will not be touched in one way or  another by what is going on in the world.  Heartsong Reviewed  by NANCY BROOKS  Indpls, IN  lay outs,   graphics     calligraphy  JILL CHAMBERS  artiste  June Millington's new album Heartsong  is out.  It's on the Olivia label, which means  of course, that is produced with the usual  care and skill of that recording company.  Heartsong is also performed with vitality  and care and skill.  June Millington has been a professional  musician since the late sixties and her experience as performer and record producer  shows in her work. Heartsong is feminist  rock at its best.  (Well, if we can have punk  rock, surely we can have feminist rock   Be  sides, since I'm usually not much of a rock  fan, I don't know what else to call this album. )  Millington's crisp and easy rhythms make  me want to dance. As I listen I visualize  a recording studio full of women playing and  grinning at each other; it's obvious from the  musicianship and spirit on Heartsong that  these folks were  cookin , when they  made this album.  There are times the lyrics warrant  close attention.  Heaven Loves the Stranger   is sort of a rock cousin to Carolyn Brandy's  Spirit Healer:   ...make me a part of the rhythm that  binds,  Bring in the faithful, the miracle  times   Cause heaven loves the stranger who  tries.   and there's Millington's comment on change in   when wrong is right-- '  Changes have their reason  when held up to the light  when wrong is right  when your love says goodbye.  Changes have to be  But I wouldn't be surprized if the  changes themselves deceived me...  There's no one left I know  in the center of my heart where the  subsequent dreams will follow...   and her wistful  Keep Me Anymore   There's nothin' in this world to keep  me anymore  Mama take me, oh take me in your arms  again  I can hardly wait to fly and taste the  wind  When the angels come to sing their song,  You know I'd like to sing along,  Singin' harmony.  Our Daughter, cum laude  The circumstances and pomp  Of college graduation,  Proclaim the sorry truth  Of our check-book mutilation   This is music with the precise attention to  detail that makes it all sound easy. It's  rock with a rich bass and not the slightest  touch of shrillness. Words can't describe  music very well. But Millington's music  describes a certain drive, a joyful assertion  of woman's power even in hard times.  June Millington has played with the more  familiar  names.  She was part of  Fanny   for five years, touring extensively in the  U.S. and Europe. She has produced albums by Chris Williamson, Holly Near and  Mary Watkins, not to mention her own earlier  work Ladies on the Stage.  She has appeared in concert with the likes of Chris  Williamson, Chicago, Barry Manilow, Buffy  Ste. Marie, Bonnie Raitt, Chuck Berry, and  Sonny and Cher. Now that's diversity   Says Millington:   I feel a lot of the songs are not  coming from me, but rather through me; the  inspiration is coming from above. We all  need to keep reminding each other to do  it right, to treat each other and this planet  with respect, with proper reverence,  Everyone   So let's bridge those gaps and  get the show on the road.

        <pagetext>8.  WOMANKIND  A Career in Mishmash  by CINDY BELLINGER  Los Alamos, NM.  When I stopped by our local Women's  Center the other day, a woman was being  counseled in job hunting   how to write a  resume, and how to make her skills appear  indispensable to an employer. I finished  with my business and headed for home   but  totally distracted.  I was thinking of my  own employment record.  .If I had to find another job right now,  where would I look and how in the world  would I fill out the job application?  What would I say? But why was I even concerned? It had never bothered me before.  My employment record isn't the best or the  most stable. It's merely interesting.  On my last birthday I turned 30. Four  months ago I took my 46th job.  Prospective employers don't want to  hear that. They want to see five years with  the same company, or some such solid evidence  that you are a dependable person. Well,  a whole lot of jobs bored me. What's wrong  with that? After a few months, even a few  days in some cases, I'd get restless and  move on to something else new and different.  Several times I was even asked to leave.  I've been fired nine times.  I used to be ashamed of my job record.  But not anymore. In a way it's become an  asset. I know exactly what I like to do.  I've tried a lot of things and I've worked  for many different kinds of employers     including myself. I have plenty of  experience which gives me a certain amount  of security. If things get rough I can always run a cash register again, and if my  body holds out I suppose I could teach  ballet once more. After 46 jobs I've learned how to survive.  But I still don't know how to  fill out   a job application. Do I put down I was  fired from one job because I didn't sleep  with the boss? Do I admit I was fired from  another job because I did sleep with the  boss? When I apply for a teaching position  is it appropriate to say I used to wrangle  horses? I've been a governess, a cook, a  model, and a maid. I've taught poetry,  horseback riding, and the hula. I've  been a receptionist for a large company,  and I've sold clothes     from fur coats  to T-shirts. Once I was a waitress in a  truck stop; and once in Tuscon I lived  on a ranch and drove the rancher's wife into  town to the beauty parlor everyday in her  Cadillac.  I have a career in mishmash.  And this is what bothers me. I am unskilled   at least in most employers' minds.  I have to lie everytime I look for a job,  then pretend I can do it once I'm hired.  In September I took a resume down to a  radio station in Santa Fe. Of course they  were hoping to find someone with a background in journalism. Well, I'd worked on  a paper (not for very long, though), and,  ah...oh, yeah I write a column for the  Women's Center newsletter. And, yes, I  sold an article once.  They did hire me and it's turning into one  of my more interesting jobs. But everytime  another month passes without getting fired  or replaced by someone who knows what  she's doing, I go out and buy a bottle  of champagne. It's a shaky way to live.  At 19, 8 jobs in one year didn't bother  me. It was an adventure. Now I want firmer  ground under me. I just hope that I can  keep this new job a little longer before  I have to fill out another application.  But at least four months look better than  four weeks.  Two Women Race Drivers  by E.K. Bramblett  Indianapolis,IN.  DESIRE WILSON PLAQOED WITH ENGINE FAILORES  Despite her efforts, the efforts of her  husband and the rest of her crew, Desire  Wilson failed to get her white Eagle-Cos-  worth racing car gualified for this year's  500 race. Plagued by engine trouble, she  went through six engines, the last which  burned out a piston on its first lap.  Though she reached a speed of 192.472, it was  not during a gualification attempt, nor fast  enough to get her into the starting field  if it had been. Midweek before the last  weekend of gualifications, she overcompensated  for a slight error in the second turn,  causing a 388-foot slide which, fortunately,  had no adverse effects on car or driver. Many  at the track commended her driving.  In regard to being the only female in many  of the higher-level races, she comments that  she's treated well by the other drivers,  'it's something I have to accept and try to  make the best of. I always do the very best  I can.   For Wilson, racing is a job like any other-  complete with setbacks. The native of Brakpan,  South Africa, enjoys racing's travel and  people, and cheerfully signs autographs and  speaks with her fans. Since 18, when her  father-technical manager for Suzuki in South  Africa-asked her if she wanted to break into  the  big stuff of motor racing, she has risen  to the top of her field. Now 28, she doesn't  consider her racing  professional  per se, as  she has never received a set salary.  During the racing seasons of 1979-80,  she raced every weekend, sometimes competing  in two or three races per weekend. She  estimates having won in the vicinity of 50  races thus far, including two world endurance  championships-similar, she says, to the 24  hours of Daytona-the 1980 British Formula 1,  in which she was the first woman ever to win  it, and this year's South African Grand Prix  in Johannesburg. Which race is her favorite?   All of them that I win,  says Desire Wilson.  JANET GUTHRIE'S CAR IN HALL OF FAME  Janet Guthrie's navy blue Turbo-Offy which  she drove in her 1976 rookie test for the  Indianapolis 500 was formally inducted into  the Gallery of Firsts in the Speedway's Hall  of Fame museum. Already, the jumpsuit and  helmet worn during the test are enshrined in  the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C.  Guthrie is the first woman to ever attempt  and successfully gualify for(and finish 9th  in) the Indianapolis 500.  Desire Wilson takes her  33 Eagle-Cosworth for a test  at 182 mph. (Photo by E.K. Bramblett)  London's LABYRIS Cabs  London's public transportation is report*  edly so unsafe for women that feminist  organizations such as Women Against Violence  Against Women are lobbying for segregated  cars in the subway and on passenger trains.  In response a new cab company has been  founded, with a fleet of 20 mini-cars.  Called Labyris, the cabs are all driven  by women and carry only women (men may  ride only if accompanied by women).  The existence of Labyris has ired many  men so that the address of the dispatch of  fice is unlisted.  BIG MAMA RAG April 1982  '/ long to speak out the  intense inspiration that  comes to me from the  lives of strong women.   Ruth Benedict  Anlbropeiiigis   Janet Guthrie takes a break during the 1978  gualifications.(Photo by K.Niles)  Before she began serious racing competition 18 years ago, she graduated from the  University of Michigan with a physics major.  From college, she worked on suborbital and  space vehicle projects for a Long Island  aviation corporation, and was one of four  women to pass the first-round eliminations  of NASA's Scientist-Astronaut program, from  which she was discontinued for lack of a PhD.  Due to the lack of big-money  sponsorship, Guthrie hasn't raced  for the past two years. To pass  time until her next race   and  maintain an income   she currently  works with Metropolitan Life's  safe driving program. She regularly writes an automotive  column for How To magazine, and  is the Automotive Editor for  Working Woman magazine.  When speaking of her present  successor at the Speedway, Desire  Wilson, Guthrie has only praise,  drive   I feel absolutely certain that if  the equipment can do it, Desire will.  So-  why has Wilson received so much less publicity  than Guthrie?  The reason for all the hullabaloo with me  was that when I first came here a lot of  people were saying that it couldn't be done.  Of course, I knew that was wrong, and I think  that came to be pretty well known..., says  Guthrie.  Guthrie is 44 years old, Wilson 28.   in many ways,  says Guthrie,  she reminds me  of myself when I was 28.  An article about Guthrie appeared in WOMANKIND,  Vol.1, 5 entitled  Janet a Feminist Says  Janet.   SPECIAL THANKS TO:  OUR LAWYERS.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  j trtptural  lt;31ntoenium  Winter Remembrance  The Plan  by SHARON HATTON  Indpls, IN  And Miriam rose before sunrise, while  Moses and Aaron and all the sons of men were  yet asleep. In the faint moonlight she  could see the shapes of other women moving  quietly to kindle cookfires and she was  filled with a strange, unutterable sadness.  And on the wind a voice came to her,  soothing and gentle and calling her name.   Miriam. Miriam.    Mother? Mother Goddess, is it you?    It is I, my child.   And lo, it was as though a loving hand  touched Miriam's cheek, and Miriam, the  prophetess, began to weep.   How did you find me here, in this barren  desert, this wasted place, where women and  children die, and all are hungry?    I always know where you are, my daughter  and I love you.   Miriam smiled and dried her eyes on the  sleeve of her robe.   is there something you would require  of me, my Mother?    Yes, my child. I see Moses writing  half-truths on clay tablets and I wonder,  where are the writings of my daughter,  Miriam?    Oh Mother, I have no time to write  on clay tablets. That is for Moses to do.  He wanders in the wilderness for days at a  time. He has no one he serves, no goats and  sheep to tend, no dying to comfort, no babes  to bring into the world...    I know, my daughter, and yet, if only  Moses leaves a record, who will know of your  struggles, your duties, your strength, how  you made freedom possible?    Moses will write of it.   Yes, my mother, for he knows that I and  all the women have kept us from starvation  lo these forty years. We have made habitable those places where no creature can live  and we have survived.    Hear, my child, the words of Moses:  'And Miriam, the prophetess, the sister of  Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand and all  the women went out after her with timbrels  and dances.   Miriam was silent for a long time.   That is all he says of me?    Yes, my child.   After I saved him from being slain by  Pharoah, after this perilous journey, after  I lifted the hearts of the weary so that  they could continue with hope when strength  was gone? After all these things...   Yes, daughter, after all these things.  And I say unto you, who will speak for the  women? How will your daughters know of your  suffering and your stength if they have  only Moses's words? When will you  speak for yourself and your sisters?   The dawn was breaking now, and Miriam  arose.  When I have time, my Mother, I will  write our women's story upon the clay  tablets. It is time for me to go now, to  prepare the breakfast and to fold the tents.  ..but as soon as I have time...as soon as I  have time....   VERACITY  CRITIQUES  Route 1 Box 195 Cambridge, MD  21613  WRITERS, LEARN THE TRUTH  ABOUT YOUR WORK   -Order a WOMANKIND Subscription  For a Friend  by Katie Niles  Written for a Women's Studies Class  by R.D. REICHARD  Muncie, IN.  The place of women in society  Has gotten recent and expanded notoriety.  However, many problems still remain  As it's our equality we strive to gain.  Although the Nineteenth Amendment gave us  our right to franchise.  It's hard to portray women accurately when  you advertise.  Most feminists agree that the role of women  in television  Is in dire need of sweeping revision.  The good housewife's most common role  Seems to be the cleaning of her toilet bowl.  And of course her family's happy if she can  stretch a dollar  Or eliminate the rings from her husband's  collar.  Even Erma Bombeck finds it hard to adjust  When her success is defined by the absence  or presence of dust.  Many women question T-V  And wonder:  is that the real me?    Am I supposed to enjoy my role and accept  it with simplicity  When I may feel trapped by my  domesticity?    Do I want to lead a mechanical life  As a super-wife?    And if I ask my spouse to help clean his  castle,  Will I escape without a hassle?   Women were malcontent even in the ages they  call Victorian,  You will find if you ask an historian.  And a man by the name of Sigmund Freud  Tried to define why a woman might feel her  life was void.  Today, of course, there's Marabel Morgan,  Whose TOTAL WOMAN sermons echo a church  organ  And women are still worried they'll  encounter sneers  When they forsake families for careers.  After all, men define women's autonomy  As a detriment to their masculine economy.  And women wonder if men derive security  If we're steadfast in our purity.  And ask any woman if a good education  Has ever resulted in her limitation.  Men are often suspicious  If a woman friend's ambitious,  And she places less importance on men and  glamour  by MARY ANN MARTIN  Indianapolis, IN  Two shadows sat on a river bank.  Looking into the water, one sighed and  said,  It's almost time.  Quietly, the  other shadow glanced up through tree limbs  at a mid-day sun and then turned over burying  her face in sweet-smelling greeness which  birthed as algae in the water's bottom and  unfolded into luxurious moss at water's edge.  She was unwilling but she, also, knew that it  was time. Her toe lay next to an unnoticed  mussel shell. A little beyond a bright green  turtle pulled up on a sandy mound and yawned.   Perhaps we could go on alone for a while  longer. Work has progressed so well,   she said.  They had begun the building process  eons before. Their eyes simultaneously evaluated the landscape. Its beauty was remarkable  the nuances of their activities in preceed-  ing centuries. Sky and wind and trees and  bird echoes, the dark sierras, yes, she knew  the day had come to get assistance. She  turned over, stretched, and slept.  Vapor rose and enveloped them.  Then after awhile, both shadows stood and  their movement caused a series of patterns as  they energized and became one with the river  mist.  Then a solitary figure reclined, shuddered,  and gave birth to the first human child.  *  And digs law and Constitutional grammar?  And unless we bring about the passage of the  E.R.A.  Male domination will continue to have a  field day,  For though we're entitled to equal pay,  It's a right men often choose to betray.  Books have been written on the American  Dream  And how it causes dissatisfied women to  scream.  Or why the story of Adam and Eve  Is one many feminists would gladly disbelieve.  And how a pattern of misogyny  Is encouraged among men and their ruling  progeny.  For example, Kate Millet's POLITICS in the  1960's dealt with sex,  A century earlier, Sarah Moore Grimke was  asking our brothers to take their feet  off our necks.  And our brothers, in the name of Man,  Have tried to discredit Betty Friedan  By accusing her logic of being oblique,  In the stirring book, THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE.  Female artists are still virtually ignored  Because when it comes to skill, men give  and receive their own award.  People today question the institution of mai  riage-  Some say it should have died with the  horse-drawn carriage.  While others find living together fine if  it's contractual  -Ask Lee Marvin--he found that financially  factual.  It seems if there's no reciprocity,  Relationships end in animosity.  It's hard for women to retain their sanity  When they're judged on the basis of their  vanity.  And the realization of identity  Sometimes means the forfeit of their  serenity.  But there's hope for femininity  If men are willing to show some elasticity  And perhaps one day rights will be equal by  a unanimous vote     Wouldn't it be nice   to end on that happy  note

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  International Women's News Network Formed  Over 120 international women journalists  from all continents met in Washington, D.C.  in mid-April and formed the Women's International Media Network (WIMN).  The first such international women's news  conference in history, the event was  sponsored by the Washington-based Women's  Institute for Freedom of the Press and the  International Women's Tribune Centre, located  in New York City.  The conference was held at the National  Press Club, which until the mid-70s refused  to admit women.  Representatives from Africa, Asia, Europe,  the Middle East, the South Pacific and South  and North America developed a loosely structured, decentralized network divided into con-  tinentally or nationally defined regions.  Women from the defined regions selected contact women to spread the network and oversee  the global exchange of women's news and information.  The U.S. will also develop regional and  national contacts, who will assist the dissemination of news coming from women in other  parts of the world, and within the U.S.,  not presently being adequately reported.  (WOMANKIND was chosen as a contact center.)  The U.S. participants at the conference  included the national women's news service,  HER SAY; editors and publishers of women's  newspapers and magazines; women journalists  in mass media, both print and broadcast; and  representatives of national women's  organizations whose membership totals in the  millions.  The conference was divided into workshops:  funding of WIMN, promotion of WIMN, how to  interrelate existing national and international  networks, and how national women's media can  fit into the world structure.  This conference was the fourth in a series  of annual conferences held at the National  Press Club since 1978 to plan a national and  international communication system for women.  Hema Goonalitake (Sri Lanka) addresses the  Conference. Donna Allen, conference Coordinator   Editor of Media Report (Women's  Institute for Freedom of the Press) enjoys  being in the front row of the audience.  (Photos by J.

        <pagetext>n.  WOMANKIND  Letters From Our Readers  When I first read an issue of WOMANKIND,  I thought this might be a place to submit  my fiction. So I polished up  Outing at  Island Park  and sent it off. Much to my delight, the editor, Judith LaFourest, took  the time to return my manuscript with  constructive criticism and the indication  that a rewrite might be acceptable.  I  got right to work. Lo and behold the revised edition of Outing at Island Park was  published in Issue 20, Volume IV, 1981 of  WOMANKIND.  Thanks to WOMANKIND for the helpful  critigue and for publishing my work. I  shall send other material to you in the  future.  I was disappointed in WOMANKIND's policy  of not sending author's copies. Although  I received a copy of my story by sending  money for the issue in which it would appear, I wonder if you could possibly send  tearsheets to writers in the SASE they send  along, since that envelope is not used for  the rejection.  I belong to International Women's  Writers Guild and a member mentioned WOMANKIND in their latest newsletter, seeking  its whereabouts. I sent her the information. I also wrote to the newsletter  editor about my story appearing in WOMANKIND.  I plan to subscribe in the near future.  Keep up the good work.  Sincerely,  Andrea Schoenthal  Wellsville, NY.  Editor's note: We do try to send at least  ONE copy to the author but sometimes cannot  afford to do so. We also send tearsheets  occasionally and will consider your suggestion. Thanks   My subscription is about to expire (or  maybe it already has). Please renew. Enclosed is a check for  5.00.  I've enjoyed every issue. After I finish  reading an issue, I just put it in the mail  for a friend who writes poetry. She lives in  a small town, works in the city, and as a  single parent has little time for tracking  these things down.  Thanks for printing the story by Andrea  Schoenthal (Outing at Island Park  issue  20 ). I met her at an International  Women's Writers Guild conference last summer  where we shared criticism and support of each  other's writing. Someday I hope to contribute  to WOMANKIND too.  Sincerely,  Ann Lee Godwin  Pittsburgh, PA.  I've been meaning to write for a subscription for a long time, but the 1982  Lexington, Ky. Women 'Writers Conference and  Laurel Smith's article on the 1981 conference  in Issue 21 finally moved me to subscribe.  Therefore, would you start my subscription with that issue?  Sincerely  Marilyn Nolan  Corydon, IN.  There's a positive aspect to the frozen,  broken water pipe mess you experienced  this winter: a cleaner, lighter, sans  serif type had to be used for the latest  edition of Womankind and it looks terrific   I'm enclosing ten dollars, five of  which is for my subscription renewal and the  other five to be used for whatever is most  needed in keeping the Womankind Center open.  Hope to hear from you soon.  As ever,  Shirley Vogler Meister  Indianapolis, IN.  Thanks for sending me a copy of WOMANKIND.  Having lived in Indiana only six months, I'm  delighted to be put in touch with local  feminist activities. I am chairing our  newly formed Women's Studies Task Force here,  so I can use all the support I can get   I will check into the possibility of putting  WOMANKIND for sale in our bookstore.  Cordially,  Lana Rakow  Journalism Department  Franklin College  Franklin, IN.  We really appreciate your suggestion of the  ad exchange. But instead, I think we will  try to buy an ad from you in the near future.  We've never run any ads anywhere so have to  make one up. You shall probably be hearing  from us soon.  These are indeed hard times for feminism.  Hope you will be able to survive.  Fight On, Sisters   Carol Hanisch, Editor  Meeting Ground  New Paltz, NY.  Please send me information on your company.  Ms. S. R. Brown  Idaho Falls, ID.  Congratulations on your new center   My best wishes for good luck and success.  Sincerely,  Velma M. Frame  Marengo, IN.  Please send us Issue 18 and 19 of your  magazine. We include  2 to pay for them.  We have been in contact with Carol Ann Wilds  and are very interested tn read her story.  We would like to see a sample copy of  your magazine, to know if we should subscribe. We are preparing resources on  New Responses to Sexual Aggression ; A Pre-  scription For A Safer Society. We are interested in prevention programs as well as remedial programs for victims and offenders.  Sincerely yours,  Jean Rosenberg  (P.R.E.A.P.)

Sincerely,  Jolene Prewit-Parker  Freeport, GRAND BAHAMA  Enclosed one dollar for sample copy of  WOMANKIND.  Thanks,  R. Gilpin  Roscommon, MI.  Thanks very much for sending response to my  poem,  Phoenix.  Your comments have helped  me toward the enclosed revision, and I'm  grateful for your consideration of it.  If  the poem is not accepted, I'd appreciate  any additional response, especially to the  revised opening of the second half of the  poem.  WOMANKIND was brought to my attention by  Alice Brand, my colleague at the University of  Missouri-St. Louis. My interest in the publication was immediate and has increased since  I've been given the opportunity to design and  teach a women's studies literature course  this summer.  I look forward to reading future  issues, especially the work of women poets.  Thanks again for your time.  Sincerely,  Lauren Lepow  Bridgeton, M0.  Editor's note: See page 5.  Please send me the writer's guidelines  for submission of materials to WOMANKIND,  Past, Present, Future.  I would also appreciate information  about subscriptions to this publication: is  it available in Washington?  Enclosed is a stamped, self-addressed envelope for these materials.  Thank you.  Grace Rhodes  Port Orchard, WA.  I want to thank your staff for their struggles and expansion.  Your growth has been an  inspiration.  Ingrid Sato  Indianapolis, IN.  Thank you for your help and your acceptance of 'March in Indiana  What a lovely  surprise  (Issue 21, Verse page 5)  I haven't been getting W.K.; the last  couple of years have been difficult here  too   So I'm sending a chegue to cover a  subscription.

Thank you for my book review (EMPOWER  ING WOMEN ALCOHOLICS TO HELP THEMSELVES  AND THEIR SISTERS IN THE WORKPLACE) in  WOMANKIND, Issue 21. Would you pass  along my thanks to Micki Perdew? Her review  was succinct and reflected her thorough  reading and appreciation of my message  within the book as well as its contents.  I  doubt that other reviewers will be as  intuitive   I have enclosed my subscription renewal  check also.Time really goes fast, doesn't  it?  Thanks again for your support and work  for all of us womyn.  Robin Jane Milstead  Dresden, OH.  WOMANKIND  317) 542-0228

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  2.  ERA rescission   attempt fails in Indiana  by MARION WAGNER   We'll be here as long as it takes, and we'll continue to come back as long as attempts are made to  nullify or rescind the ratification of the Equal Rights  Amendment.     With that statement given in a  N.O. W. (National Organization for Women) press  release on February 12, 1979,  a daily lunch hour  vigil began in the Indiana State Capitol building in  downtown Indianapolis.  The vigil, the phone banks, the letters to the  Indiana legislators, the lobbying, etc. were successful and the attempt to enact legislation that  would proclaim Indiana's 1977 ratification of the  ERA null and void was defeated.  Once again ERA proponents in Indiana united to  overcome opponents of equal rights for women.   Led  by the National Organization for Women, an organization that believes in high visibility, the vigil  continued even after the bill had died in committee.  As a reminder to the legislature that NOW was  aware of the possibility of bill stripping, such as  occurred in Kentucky last year, the vigil lasted  until the legislative session was over.  Over 15 phone banks in Indiana were in operation and the legislators were lobbied daily.  Quietly and without fanfare, Ellie Smeal, NOW  president, came to Indiana and gave advice, aid,  and a much needed shot-in-the arm when the  campaign was organized.   Other NOW leaders  and workers were also involved before and during the successful effort.  The Indiana Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs,  The ERA Indiana Coalition    representing over 24 organizations,  including the Religious Coalition for the ERA,  and  many other groups and individuals urged the defeat of any attempt to harm the ERA in any way.  The rescission attempt appears to have strength-  end the bonding and commitment of the Indiana  NOW and the proponents of the Equal Rights Amendment.   They are aware, however, that time spent  on this campaign took away time that might have  been better spent working for ratification in other  states.  The Indiana NOW affirms and recommits itself  to this end: to assist three more states in ratifying  and to assure that Indiana will not be the last  state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.  Vigil coordinator Barb Harris (1) and Assoc. Editor of  WOMANKIND, Mary Osborn listen attentively to Ellie  Smeal. (Photo by J.

In view of the increasing number of rapes, these were the concerns  of the board members of The National Organization  for Women when they decided to sponser a Stop  Rape NOW action on Monument Circle, in Indianapolis on Thursday, April 12, 1979 from 11:30 to  1:00 P.M.  Approximately 15 people representing the Indianapolis Chapter of N.O. W. handed out literature that contained suggestions on how to avoid  being raped and what to do if you are raped.   The  pamphlets distributed were supplied by the Indiana  State Police and by the Marion County Victim Advocates Program, Inc.   The Indianapolis News  supplied reprints of  Watch It-He Could Be a Rapist.'  Copies of this article are available at The Woman's  Touch in Indianapolis at 6352 W. 37th Street-46224.  (Send a self-addressed stamped envelope.)  Spokeswoman, Rev. Jeanine Rea was interviewed  by representatives from the media and part of Rev.  Rea's prepared statement is reprinted here:    Spring is a time of renewal; it is a time  to be outdoors, enjoying the sunshine or the  warm rain as Mother Earth begins to blossom.  But spring also brings a dramatic increase  of rapes.   And so, for women, young   and old,  spring and summer are times of heightened fear.  Rape is on the increase.   Not only has the  number of reported rapes in March increased  over February, but more significantly, the  number of rapes reported in those two months  have drastically increased over the same two  months of last year.  Our goals for the Stop Rape Now campaign  are two-fold: 1. to educate every woman regarding the ways in which she may protect herself; and 2. to urge every citizen to report immediately to authorities any suspected act of  violence.  We believe that education allays panic.   The  education of all women (because we are all potential victims) on how to protect themselves  in ways other than the indiscriminate and dangerous use of firearms is essential.  We urge  women to take courses in self-defense.   We urge you to give the women in your  life (wives, grandmothers, mothers, daughters,  lovers) a gift which may very well save her life:  a pamphlet which you read together and a course  in self-defense.   Alice Paul Chambers holds a pamphlet available  from the Indiana State Police:  Safety  for  Women.   Alice Paul and her mother Jill participated in the Stop Rape NOW Action,  (Photo by J. LaFourest)  Posters carrying appropriate messages (see front  cover) were displayed or carried.   These posters  were artistically created by Jill Chambers and  Eddie Grogan.  The action was deemed highly successful.  WOMANKIND P.O. Box 16308 Indianapolis, Indiana 46216.  Single copy 50C in U.S.A. Subscription Rate:  5.00  Copyright      1979   by J. LaFourest and M.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  What Price  Passivity  by ROBERTA LYNCH  I am the kind of person who is always convinced  I will be run over by a crazed ambulance driver  whenever I walk to the grocery store, or plunged  into a fiery end by a drunken pilot whenever I  board an airplane.    Somehow these fears make  me less susceptible to the growing obsession with  the pollutants in our air and our food.  Despite friends who compulsively read me the  labels on bacon packages and develop acute coughs  in the vicinity of steel mills,  I've continued to  live my life as though red dye   2 was just the  latest in Easter egg colorings and plutonium was  something out of a Superman comic.  I oppose nuclear power plants largely because  I feel certain that anything so vigorously promoted by such notorious truth-benders and profit-guzzlers as the energy monopolies has to be  questionable.   Plus,I find their argument that  nukes aren't any riskier than  automobiles slightly  absurd.   If that's the case, why don't they offer  every American a little booklet from which to  memorize twenty questions on the order of  What  button should you push when the bubble starts to  expand?  and then give you a license to operate  one?  Lately, it's begun to dawn on me that I am in  real danger. I live within 100 miles of five nuclear power plants  Three Mile Island has dramatically demonstrated  that millions of Americans are living in the potential  trouble belt  of nuclear plants. Millions more  are in the vicinity of nuclear dumping grounds or  the roads or rails over which nuclear wastes are  casually transported.  It isn't just the threat of a nuclear accident that  worries me, though. It's the passivity with which  people responded to the TMI incident.  When the accident occurred,  why didn't everyone run away right away?   I'm not for mass panic  or pandemonium,  but a little confusion,  even    a  little hysteria,  seems preferable to the placid attitude that keeps people fixed in place.  I'm sure the reasons that people stayed were  mixed.    Many simply had nowhere to go. The government wouldn't try to accomodate them until it  decided that things were getting too risky (judging  by the evidence now being released,  this probably  would have coincided with the first big bang).  Others clung to the belief that those in control  really knew what was going on.   They tried to  follow all the absurb directives being pumped out  to give a semblance of protection:  First shower  with hot water,  then with cold.   ( Or is it the other  way   around. . . ?)  Equally disturbing was the lack of protest  in the  area.    Why wasn't everyone marching on Metropolitan  Edison fast and furious?   The situation was likely   a  matter of life and death.   Yet published reports showed  little hostility toward the company that brought it all  on.  This lack of response poses one of the most serious  questions raised by the TMI incident: What does it  take to get people angry (or scared) enough to break  through traditional patterns of authority and behavior?  It is not a question that is restricted to a bunch  of  small towns in Pennsylvania,   Although anti-nuclear  demonstrations around   the country have increased in  size and number since TMI, only 40  of those questioned in a post-TMI Gallup poll felt that the situation there wasn't handled as well as possible.   And a  clear majority-63 - still favored the development of  more nuclear power plants.   (On the plus side, this  was down from a pre-TMI figure of 11  )  I think that some of this surprising complacency  has to do not so much with a faith in our leaders  as it does with a faith in technology---and technocrats.  There are other current issues on which people  have shown some willingness to challenge. But  they are usually issues that people believe--  whether rightly or wrongly are within their ken.  Nuclear power---that's something else.   It's  as mysterious to most people as the origins of the  universe.   In fact, for many people technology is  a new kind of god, in which is placed the same  questioning trust once reserved only for the  Almighty.  Those in power do their best to compound this  notion. They constantly try to make it seem as  though the facts are far too complex and technical for the average person to begin to understand.  In addition to this mystification of technology,  another problem has been the lack of clear alternatives in the public eye.  Continued to p. 11  Up and      Coming  ARTIST/NURSE-KARIN   STACEY  A winged woman's form rises out of the cadu-  ceus,  the symbol of the medical profession.   This  image is symbolic of Karin Sundt Stacey, a registered nurse who is winging her way towards an art  career.   Her dual desires go back into her child -  hood.   I always wanted to be a nurse. Deep down I  always wanted to be an artist, too, but I wasn't  sure I could,   she said.  Karen was born into a medical family. Her  mother was a registered nurse of Norwegian de      scent and her father was a  Canadian-born thoracic surgeon who died from a brain tumor when  she was six months old.  At thirteen, Karin began painting. She studied  under private instructors and attended New Mexico State University where she studied fine arts.  She took fashion merchandising at the Fashion  Institute of America in Atlanta, Georgia.   I feel compelled to record on canvas my perceptions and how I feel about things,   said Karin.   I want to express my changing existence and  opinions, to keep a record of myself for myself  and those who care for me so they can always tell  what I was thinking and feeling.   I wish my father  had done this for us.   I regret not knowing more a-  bout him.  Karin regards herself as a  visual person  and uses  her art to help clarify things for herself.  Impasses  or  passages  of her life are worked out on  canvas.   It's like having your own psychiatrist there sometimes ,   she says.    Through her art she also reflects  on and portrays our culture to  help other people  see.    A series of paintings,    Woman's  Form--Woman's Spirit,   are the  result of Karin's exploration of  what it is to be a woman.  In  searching for a symbol to represent women she decided woman's  form was the most easily recognized symbol   I wanted to show her as strong, happy,  moving  forward and upward   so I chose a woman jumping and throwing her hair,   she said.    Karin experimented with color/mood relationships, abstract forms and multiple forms using the same figure as a base element in all.   Her woman symbol  is available to the public on note cards.  In an earlier picture,   Moonrise Over New Mexico,    Karin attempted to represent creation using a man  to represent mankind.   She was unable to complete  the picture.   I think that this was because I was beginning to  realize that the word 'mankind' does not represent  all people, only half of them,   she said.   She started that painting eight years ago   a male form  standing beside a broken egg shell, as if he had just  hatched.    The background is a forest and sky, but  the man and the egg remain colorless upon the naked  canvas board.  Karin who has lived in Indianapolis for several  years recently decided to leave her job at the  Indiana University Hospital in Indianapolis to pur -  sue her art career in Santa Fe, New Mexico,  Before leaving Indianapolis,  Karin was able to  gain some exposure for her artwork.   The IUPUI  Student Union Building displayed some of her works  last March, just before she departed.    She donated  a painting to the National Organization for Women  (NOW) so that it could be raffled off to help raise  funds.  Her  American Woman Collage  was displayed  at a local bookstore/women's center,  THE  WOMAN'S TOUCH.  The collage was created in May,  1978 after Karin  had saved women's photographs since 1970,   I was concerned that the ERA was not going to  be ratified by enough states in time for the deadline.    I had also reached a time in my own development when it was time to speak out,   she said.  Karin's childhood difficulties have taken her  years of anger to work through.   After her father's  death, her mother was left to raise three children     all under three years   alone,   A year later, her  mother married a mining engineer.   His work resulted in a number of moves for the family.   Before high  school graduation Karin had lived in New Mexico,  Arizona, Colorado, and Washington.   I felt uprooted and lost. My best friend through  childhood was my dog,   she said. Life centered a-  round her stepfather's diabetes. Her mother nursed  the family but  went along with the social thing to  do  and gave up her nursing career for  the sake of  the family . Her mother nursed, but only inside  the family.  by NANCY SCOTT   Parents are only people   they're not perfect,    Karin said.     I've paid my dues.   Now what I do  is mine.    One of Karin's paintings,   After the Storm ,  shows what she calls her  rainbow-self.   The  painting is a colorful multi-image of her woman-  form     The colors represent the many changes she  has gone through to reach her present state.   I have weathered the storm of growing up, graduating from college (B. S.,  Indiana University School  of Nursing),  and going through a divorce,  and I am  much stronger,   Karin said.   The promise stormy periods hold in our lives  is that after the storm comes the rainbow and the  renaissance of the self,     Aloneness ,  a black-and-white work of planets,  really represents people,   Karin created it at a  time when she had to act without the aid of friends  or loved ones   when she had to take a stand all on  her own.    After doing the painting she  realized  that everyone has these times.   I felt a part of the  mainstream of people again, no longer alone.    Karin's main philosophy is that everyone has a  purpose and reason for being and all are here to  progress toward perfection.    When perfection is  reached, reincarnation occurs.  Being in nursing and working with the dying  and critically ill has made Karin increasingly  aware  that you never know how long your life is  going to be,     I'm tired of being Florence Nightingale.   I want  to give to myself,   she said.    That does not mean  she is ready to give up nursing altogether.   I'll never leave nursing,   it's a part of me     a philosophy---helping your body to live its fullest and nurturing soul as well as body.   I nurse  everyday of my life,   I just don't get paid for it,    she said.  According to Karin, the B. S. four year nursing  program is the nursing of the future and  way ahead  of the medical mentality.    It emphasizes the balance of physical, mental, and spiritual,   Spirituality doesn't have to be denominational,    Karin said.     Everyone has a philosophy of life  whether they are aware of it or not and that's a part  of spirituality.    Karin describes her specialty as  exploring images  or landscapes of the soul.     Her artistic directions  also include philosophical questions confronting the  world and the spiritual, physical and emotional aspects of people and how these affect overall health  and daily living.   She is entering a new phase of art     one concerned with all humanity and the mirroring of cultures.  The move to Santa Fe was the first move Karin  ever made that was   totally for myself with no one  waiting and no one leaving.     There were times  when she was scared; she spent sleepless nights working through the decision.   I'd be more scared if I stayed.   I have a lot of  energy to go.   I would have to block that energy in  order to stay,   she said as friends helped her pack.  Necklaces of corn, shells and yam dangled down  from a nail in the wall.   A curtain flapped in and  out the open window.   Miscellaneous and misplaced  objects waited in piles   a feather, a baloon,  scrawled memos,  combs, pins, lipstick, and a  wooden box.

        <pagetext>4.  WOMANKIND  From the Journal   Courier, Sesquicentennial Edition, Lafayette, Ind., June 27, 1975. With permission from the. authors.  HELEN MAR JACKSON GOUGAR 19TH CENTURY LEADER  by MARY E. ANTHROP AND DEBORAH R. SEDERS  At a time when women's politics seemed to belong in the parlor, Helen Mar Jackson Gougar  stepped out in front.  A leader in the woman's suffrage and temperance movements in the second half of the 19th  century,  Helen Gougar lived most of her 63  years in Lafayette,  Indiana,  She came from Litchfield,  Michigan in 1859  when she was nearly 16 to take a job as an assistant teacher to help pay for her younger sisters'  education.  Although her formal education stopped before  she came here, she was appointed teacher and  principal of Jenks Public School, the first woman  principal in Lafayette, in 1864.   Hillsdale (Mich.)  College, where she completed three years in the  preparatory department, later awarded her an honorary M. A. degree in 1892.  Some say that Helen Gougar's temperance crusade was inspired by a scene she may have witnessed early in life---a neighbor murdered by her  husband  while he was insane through strong drink,    the terrified children,   the bleary-eyed husband.  At that point it's believed Gougar saw that women  were the greatest victims of liquor.   The vote, she  realized, was the key to combatting the saloon.  But the vote wasn't easy to acquire.   It wasn't  until 1920, she had been dead 13 years, that Indiana and the country passed suffrage amendments  and the federal constitution added its prohibition  amendment.  Helen Gougar,  considered an excellent speaker  and writer, set upon her career as a suffrage and  temperance reformer by the late 1870's,   In the  following 20 years she criss-crossed the state and  nation on lecture tours,  testified before state legislatures and congressional committees, edited  her own weekly temperance and suffrage paper,   Our Herald,   and became the first woman to  argue before the Indiana Supreme Court.  Ten years before she had argued a test case on  women's suffrage in the Indiana Supreme Court.  Now she found herself in court for another  reason: defending her honor.  Her involvement in temperance and suffrage  reform had made her politically active on a  wide scale     Her vocal and printed support of  longtime family friend,W.D.  Wallace,  who  was running for state senator in 1882 on the  Republican ticket stirred the ire of opposing  Democrats,  the liquor interests (Wallace,  too, was a prohibitionist) and even some  Republicans.  Gougar's character was attacked viciously in the  1882 campaign, and she demanded justice.   She  filed a slander suit against Henry Mandler, police  chief and ex-saloon keeper,  for alleging she and  Wallace committed adultery the night of November 19,  1882,  in Wallace's law office.  The three -month trial centered on the adultery charge,  but other witnesses hinted at numerous secret rendezvous at temperance conventions  to discredit her character.    Tempers flared,  and  at times orderly court procedure was ignored.  Gougar won the suit and was awarded  5, 000  in damages.     Our Herald,   the paper she edited  from 1881 to 1885, printed an editorial from another publication Gougar contributed to,  saying  the verdict had more than local significance.   It means that women who choose to enter  public or political life are not to be lightly  or wantonly assailed by those who disagree  with them, or by those who cannot answer  theii arguments,   read the editorial.    It means that no one class of men, be  they blackguards or reputable citizens, are  to fix die standards of womanly character  and to speak contemptously and insulting  of all who do not happen to be of their  way of thinking.    The Lafayette Daily Journal urged the community to put the case to rest, but also warned  on April 12,  1883:    Consequently a woman cannot be too careful in her daily walk among men.   She should  *avoid even the appearance of evil'.   To fly in  the face of public opinion and bid defiance to  the long established rules of intercourse between men and women is as unwise as it is  dangerous.    Modesty and delicate reserve are the  bright jewels in the crown of womanhood.    The ordeal turned Helen Gougar's hair prematurely white, but it didn't stop her public campaign.        UJcrnarShine  Ftoductions  PATCHWORK POWER, a 3 act original play written  by Sharon Hattonaand directed by Nancy Sundell is  available for performances at conventions, meetings,  celebrations, conferences, and any place that people  gather.

The next two performances will be at the North  Methodist Church in Indianapolis. (See below)  J*     PATCHWORK POWER    J    Helen Mar Jackson Gougar (Photo Courtesy of Mary  Anthrop and the Tippecanoe Co. Historical Assoc.)  She based her political alliance on issues,  not  party lines     Disillusioned with the Republicans  in 1884 for their turn against prohibition and for  failing to get the vote for women, she joined  the Prohibition Party,  working diligently for it  in the next eight years.    She then supported the  National Party and its free-silver, woman  suffrage and temperance platform,  and then  leaned toward the Democrats.  Although politics played a lesser part in her  later years,  issues were still uppermost in her  mind.. Encouraged by an Indiana Supreme  Court decision permitting women to practice  law,  she appeared at the polls at the November,  1894 election.    She was denied ballots for the  jtate,   county,  and township elections,  even  after she presented an affidavit of her citizenship  She then sued the election board.  Decades of reading law books and legal documents  to her husband, whose sight was failing, paid off.  She was admitted to the Indiana bar on January 10,  1895, and she argued her own case eloquently.  However, she lost.   She appealed to the state supreme court, which upheld the lower court's decision.  Her suit. against the election board marked her  last major public effort to see that women had the  right to vote.  Earlier she had organized a suffrage club in  Tippecanoe County in August,  1883, and four  years after that joined Indiana suffrage backers  May Wright Sewall and Ida H, Harper in forming  a state suffrage organization.   She served as president of the state organization for 23 years,  working with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady  Stanton.   In her monthly-turned-weekly paper,  Gougar introduced prominent reform leaders  through biographical sketches.   Elizabeth Cady  Stanton gave a short talk before approximately  150 guests in the Gougar home.  At Gougar's last public prohibition speech,  she urged passage of die amendment before  the 1906-07 state legislature     She continued  to submit social anc' political articles to  local newspapers,  and had turned in an article  on the woman's vote to the Lafayette Leader  several weeks before her death.    She was  considering writing a history of woman's  suffrage,  but her plans were stopped by a  heart attack the morning of June 6, 1907,  in  her home on Columbia Street.

        <pagetext>VERSE  WOMANKIND  Book       The Women's Room  Review:  by Marilyn French  Snapshot of Susan Moore Speer  She had been a lone  hard woman  niece of an Irish poet  protesting rosaries  and hating necklaces  and softness.  Mother of ten  (one of them daft or deaf)  and married, God help us,  to one of your soft meek  blond Scotch Irish,  a wagonwright.  Late in her life  her ringing voice found need  of counterpoint  with the softer ones around her.  Stricken at last  but hungry still  for sight of grandness out of doors,  thirsty for windows  she cried (I hear it in the voice  of her granddaughter image)   O Weemen, lift me up I   by ANITA SPEER SMITH  An Unanswered Question from the Greening Days  What reason for the mindless act of passion?  The wheedling, giggling, touching, sucking  Wet kisses, wet bodies, the salt-water flowing,  Closed eyes,  closed minds,  animal fashion,  Grinding and pounding, quivering, bucking,  Animal noises, emotion fast-growing  To the point of departure for all that is us?  These two small,  wet beasts with the fumbling hands,  With the skulls full of nothingness,  cannot be us.  The whimpers and whispers that echo in space  Are not from the lips of intelligent Man.  In that moment we share in Creation with GOD,  We are brought to our knees in the primeval dust.  by MARTHA ESTHER EUBANKS  Denver Duo  I  Up crisp winding trails  Pines perfume the air aqua  In palpable cold.  II  In windless darkness  Colfax gleams gold and scarlet  Beckoning to sin.  (East Colfax is the center of Denver's  club, nude bar, photography studio,  etc. district.    At night from  the  hills above the city, the lights are  incredible. )  by JENNY LEE-PARK  The Girl with the Curl  That one about the girl  With the curl,  Well, with you  It's true.  Always I have to assess  When you call  If you're all there  And work the conversation around  To insinuate how much  You've been drinking  Because that's a good index  Of whether the depression's real  Or just brandy-induced.  You ramble a lot  And repeat yourself,  But then there are days  For just an hour or two  When the curl on the forehead  Perks  The eyes are alert  And the brain functions  Like a hair trigger  On a Browning automatic.  Then we sit down  To the reason we were ever  Friends in the first place  And snap off a fifty minute round  That would curl the world.  (Summit Books,  1977. Jove/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich,  1978 paperback)  WOMAN   THE   OPPRESSED by JUDITH RAE ROGERS  by LAUREL SPEER  The particular setting in THE WOMAN'S ROOM  is unimportant.   It could be any middle class neighborhood and any university community.   The situation and the message are universal.  It's like Marilyn French sneaked her tape recorder into my house and into my neighbors' houses  when we were at home with our pre-schoolers.  Her vivid descriptions and conversations relate our  words, our thoughts, our feelings, and our frustrations.  The novel is the story of Woman--first as a young  housewife/mother in the.middle class suburbs and  later as the returning-to-school graduate student  in her mid-to-late-30's.   The every day happenings and emotions are painfully realistic and  honest.  French's purpose in writing this book is to present the truth about the equality of men and women.  She states this simply and unequivocally in a discussion about male legitimacy:  When a man loses superiority, he loses  potency.   That's what all this talk about  castrating women is about.   Castrating women are those who refuse to pretend men  are better than they are and better than  women are.    The simple truth--that men  are only equal--can undermine a culture  more devastatingly than any bomb. Subversion is telling the truth.  It is an almost catastrophic shock to this woman  when she faces two truths at the end of the novel:  I am and I want.   ... she realized that these were  two statements she had never felt permitted to utter, or even to think.    The thesis of this book centers on the denial  of these truths.    It presents Woman's purpose as  the one who caters to Man and to his children.  Woman fulfills Man's wants and needs.  THE WOMAN'S ROOM should be required reading for all women at two decision-making times  in their lives   when they are considering marriage and when they are considering motherhood.  Reading the book at these times might prevent  many marriages,  pregnancies,  and later divorces.  Whether married,  pregnant,  or a mother,   THE  WOMAN'S ROOM, will undoubtedly help women  with marital and/or parenting situations. Because  of the questions which the book forces the reader  to raise in her own life, she will be better prepared to deal with a husband ano/or children.  Also, she will try to assure that her life will  not be one of despair, dependency,  and victimization.  The novel constantly forces the reader to delve  into unconscious feelings.   Not only the events,  conversations,  and emotions of the novel, but also  the author's philosophical interjections lead us to  her thesis:  It's as though, deep, deep,  at the  heart, the silent heart that rarely erupts,  that keeps still because if it didn't the  world would be destroyed, deep there  underneath, the sexes hate and fear  each other.   Women see men as oppressors, as tyrants, as an enemy with superior strength to be outwitted.   Men see women as underminers, slaves who rattle the  their chains threateningly,  constantly reminding the men that if they wanted to,  they could poison their food:   just watch  out.  THE WOMAN'S ROOM is Marilyn French's  first novel though she has written many short  stories, scholarly articles,  and THE BOOK AS  WORLD:   JAMES JOYCE'S ULYSSES.    French was  graduated from high school at 16,  two years younger than most of her classmates.  In the February 20, 1978 issue of JBfiople magazine, she admits that when she got married in 1950   My only dream was of the pink-and-blue bedroom,  of a happy family and kids.   I held onto it for seventeen years.    In 1951 she was graduated from Hofstra  University in Hempstead, N.Y. with honors. After  her divorce in 1967, she supported herself and her  two children on her fellowships.   She received her  doctorate from Harvard.  Parts of THE WOMAN'S ROOM are autobiographical     French is in both the two main characters  Mira and Val.   Just as Val's daughter is raped in  the novel,  French's daughter was raped in 1972.  Val's feelings and those of Marilyn French are  identical:  Whatever they may be in public life,  whatever their relations with men,  in their relations with women,  all men are rapists,  and that's  all they are.    They rape us with their eyes, their  laws,  and their codes.   There is much anger in THE WOMAN'S ROOM.  Often,  as I read,  animosity and resentment boiled  inside me.    I felt the pain, the despair, the hopelessness of the pre-school mother trapped at home,  of the abandoned wife,  of the not-taken-seriously  graduate student, of the raped girl's mother.  At times,  I was furious with the author for making  me feel such wrathful indignation.   But I knew she  did not cause the rage within me.    She merely made  me focus in on the anger and resentment that have  always been there.  I think both the writing and the reading of this  anger and resentment  are emotionally healthy.  If  women are to surmount these hostile feelings,  they  must be recognized and dealt with.    It is unrealistic  and even dangerous to deny such sentiments.  In the People article, French states (in connection  with her anger about her daughter's rape),   I'm less angry now. Being too deep in anger corrodes your interior.    French also aids the reader in dealing constructively  with her negative feelings as she reads the book.    For  example,  I have repeatedly said to myself a paraphrase  of the author's words in the novel:   There is no justice.  There is only life.   And life I have.  The author also warns us not to put the total responsibility of women's situations on men:  It's easy enough to blame men for rotten  things they do to women, but it makes me  a little uncomfortable.    It's too close to the  stuff I read in the fifties and sixties when  everything that went wrong in a person's life  was Mother's fault.   All of it.   Mothers were  the new devil.    Poor mothers,  if only they  realized how much power they had    Castrat-  ers and smoothers, they were unpaid servants  of The Evil One.   It is true that men are responsible for much of the pain in women's  Lives   one way or another,  whether personally or as part of a structure that refuses to let  women in at all,  or keeps them in subordinate  positions    But is that all of it?. . . power is not  something you possess,  but is something granted to you by those you have power over.  I think French wants us to recognize and experience  our anger towards men, but she does not want us to  stay entangled in the bitterness or resentful ness.    In  People she speaks of surviving:    If you're a survivor,  yougo on surviving. . . You lose the dreams, but you can  learn to get somewhere.    THE WOMAN'S ROOM is hard to put down.    The  realistic conversations and detailed narratives are  lively and clear.   It seems that all of women's feelings and events have been covered.    What could possibly happen next    Its length (687 paperback pages)  is justified by the complexity of the ideas covered.  I would like to believe that Mira's relationship with  her teen-aged sons is realistic; for, I feel, the hope for  working out this woman/man conflict is with our sons.  Just as Mira has in the novel,  Marilyn French apparently has a good relationship with her son.   About  her linguistics graduate student son she says,   he is  a wonderful human being who gives me hope for the  male gender.    Marilyn French successfully achieves her purposes  in writing THE WOMAN'S ROOM.    She portrays the  truth about women and men's relationships in a believable,  realistic way.    She also constructively  vents her anger.  And her book is being read. The hard cover edition  was on  the New*York Times Book Review Best Seller  List for thirty'-six weeks     in February,  1979,  the paper  back edition was still the current number one best seller.  Towards the end of her novel,  French states effectively the answer to why many women will not dare read a  book such as THE WOMAN'S ROOM and why they will  not accept the women's movement for their own lives:  Once you start to question your actions,  once you begin to let yourself think you  might have been wrong about something-  then everything topples, because one wrong  action last week was founded on a choice  made fifteen years ago,  and you have to  question everything, everything.  In THE WOMAN'S ROOM, Marilyn French forces  us to ask ourselves questions we might prefer to  ignore

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Not everyone can be a Big Sister. Not everyone can be an IBM executive, train conductor,  teacher or homemaker either.  Being a Big Sister means taking on a very  special role.  It takes a happy person, comfortable with  others.  It takes an accepting, tolerant person who  isn't shaken or discouraged by other viewpoints  and lifestyles.  It takes a strong commitment to reach out  and find a common thread that can be woven  into the fabric of a meaningful friendship  Big Sister Irene Claytor has a story worth  telling and she does it very well in this description of her first meeting with her Little  Sister.  Big Sister Little Sister  by IRENE CLAYTOR  Although I thought I had preoared myself for  the encounter, my fingers tightened uncomfortably on the steering wheel as I neared my destination.  I suddenly realized how typically  suburban I  looked,  dressed fashionably and driving our  woody station wagon.   Maybe I would have felt  more comfortable in the VW, wearing jeans and  a T-shirt, but I was late and there was no time  for changes.  The problem was that I didn't know what they  expected.   The training supervisor had simply  said,   A meeting will be arranged for you to  meet your Little Sister and her family.   The  caseworker, of course,  will be there to make  the introductions.     Somehow,  I didn't feel this  was a simple procedure, and I feared my nervousness showed.  I was greeted by a small group of children with  dirty faces, tattered clothing, and a look of anticipation in their eyes.  Are you the Big Sister? ,  they asked. I managed to answer that I was. My  eyes skimmed the gathering, and I wondered if the  child I had come to meet was among them.  As I walked up the stairs,  there was no doubt as  to the identity of the two women sitting on the  porch.    The caseworker was jotting down notes,  briefcase at her side,  clad in a neat skirt and  blouse. In a T-shirt that read  Foxy Lady,   the  other woman was nervously pushing her long  bleached hair from her eyes.  The house was, as I expected, badly in need of  repair.   It seemed to have a look of resignation,  almost comfortable in its poverty.  I smiled politely, greeted the women,  and  calmly introduced myself.    My mind,  however,  spoke to me of the situation with a slightly different observation:    Hello,   I'm Mrs.  Do-Gooder,  coming to the inner-city from comfortable suburbia to carry out my social duty.    Will you kindly  be the recipient?    I started wondering what I  had gotten myself into.  The awkwardness between us,  however,  didn't  last.   Relief swelled in me as I was once more reminded of the special bond that exists between women,  as different as they may appear.  an independent womens newsjoumal  women in struggle  politics, health, work, prison  news coverage and political analysis  on the issues that affect womens lives  contributing sub  12 a -  oneyeai sub S6  i kj institution   oob, 1724 20th st. nw,  wash, dc 20009  Jig sister Irene helps little sister Ranae with her  angel's wings in preparation for a costume party  Sometime during our conversation,  a shy little  girl with searching brown eyes peeked around the  corner.   Her mother called her over and introduced us.   Her hair was tangled, her jeans torn,  and her nose was running.   She nervously shuffled her feet and said hello.  I answered with a smile and a nod,  but my  mind,  again, was speaking a different story.   Dear little girl,  I wonder if you could ever  believe that I was once like you, young and sad  and longing.   By letting me become part of your  life, perhaps I can repay some of the kindnesses  once shown to me, without ever forgetting the  pain of growing up with so many odds against you.  It is the memory of that pain that causes me to  reach out to others.    And I am reaching out to  you.   She and I talked for a few minutes and made  plans for our first outing together.  And so a friendship began.  Driving home,  I was aware that I looked the  same,  but I felt  different  and very good about  myself.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Her alarm was set for five o'clock.   Our appointment was at one.   I looked at the mass of long,  brown hair that curled at the ends and the large,  wide, brown, often haunting eyes, now covered  in sleep.   White, ghost-like skin and the well-developed ten-year old body shown partially from under the covers.   She was tall for her age with broad  shoulders, slim hips and unusual hands, the long  fingers like a pianist's.  I quickly entered the bedroom and began to finish the packing for the trip, knowing that I would  once more have a sleepless night.  I could hear her stir, in the early morning darkness, bumping the furniture in her room, dressing,  checking her suitcase.   The bed had squeaked while  she slept--restlessly,  awakening, then dozing--  frightened.   She'd taken her bath the evening before and laid out her clothes.  At five, the house was cold and my robe was not  adequate as I hurried down the stairs.   We had  never gotten up this early before.   For her the  darkness was a scary monster.   The water splashed  against the basin--she was brushing her teeth; now  it stopped--silence.   She was combing her long,  brown hair.   It fell below her waist making curls  on the very end, causing Brooke and Tracy to be  envious.   She had no friends.   Hurry  Mom,   she called.    I'd like some  waffles, please.    Her skip echoed on every  other step.  She sat down and began eating her favorite  breakfast.   Food was something she never refused;  she drank her milk, wiped her mouth with the napkin--never a sound.   Oh  I forgot to make my bed.    We will excuse you this time--this is a special  day.   She finished her breakfast; then her father loaded  the station wagon.   He'd always favored her--the  first born with melting brown eyes and a smile,  a  special smile for him--and now to pay her tuition,  to help her, he would borrow thousands of dollars  on his life insurance.   From the first, she'd called  him Morton.   When she was little, he would pick  her up, swing her high and sit her on his shoulders.  Now his face was prematurely lined and sad.  A large, blue suitcase  marked Jill--131 stood in  the hall.   It was still new.   She had chosen it last  year.   It contained the required clothing list,  fourteen pairs of under pants, eight pairs of slacks,  twelve blouses--all marked 131.  During the past month,  we had altered hand-me-  downs, repaired seams and holes, taken up hems,  and bought several new things.   Jill had helped,  threaded the needle and cut the labels, one by  one, from the roll.   Marabell, she decided, would  be the doll to go along--she'd use the red sled this  time and maybe next year they'd teach her to ice  skate.   Every afternoon we'd talk about the nuns --  why they wore black, why they must have devoted  their lives to God and their reasons for the constant praying and hope they must give the world.  Some of this she could understand--other times  she would sit and smile with that vacant stare.

Congratulations   Best Wishes to Joan and Mary  9  c  by ELIZABETH HOSTEIN  We'd practiced using the telephone.    It would  be long distance,  I explained, and when we  called to say hello-she couldn't waste money  sitting there.  She'd asked,   Why must I hurry?   You'll be on  the other end.    It's expensive calling long distance.   Jill,  you'll be approximately five-hundred miles  from home and we will be anxious to hear about  you and your new experiences,   I answered.  We'd promised to write a letter once a week.  She would have to ask Sister Carol Marie to read  it to her and perhaps when Sister had time she  would write a letter home.  Last fall, Sister Carol Marie had said,  Use  only the first name--then identity could be kept  secret--just in case.      So the sled had 131  painted on it and Marabell's right leg displayed  131 awkwardly.   Marabell wouldn't have liked  this.   She was a classy doll.  Ever since November I had worried.   Would  they discipline her harshly?   Would they really  understand?  Brooke and Tracy felt guilty now  that she was actually leaving.   They envied her--  she was the oldest and going away.  Often the safety patrol boy would tell her she  was a blue fairy.   He would not let her go across  the walk until she fluttered her wings and flew.  She thought the school children liked her, and  she would do it.   Then the fourth graders chanted,   Blue fairy, blue fairy,   and made her flop her  arms.   Brooke and Tracy would rescue her--all  three in tears,  running home.    Maybe St.  Co-  letta's might be the solution.  After breakfast,  she watered her begonias and  hugged Troubles.  '*Be good,   she said,    I'll be back.     She  kissed his whiskers.   The whiskers were special--  she remembered the times she had trimmed them.  She stroked his head and held one nail-polished  paw between her fingers rubbing it against her  cheek.   Brooke and Tracy began to cry.   Be brave, be brave like me,  she called,  as she climbed into the station wagon.  The  time will go quickly.    Once we were on Route 30, the sun rose as the  morning progressed.   Super highways, restaurants,  trucks and buses, great expanses of space hovered  over and ahead of us.  After lunch we put gas in the station wagon and  continued to chatter, listening to the car radio.  Jill's questions came rapidly.     What would her  new friends be like?   Would the nun's always  wear the same dresses?   Would they have a dog?  Would they have a big cat like Troubles?  When we left the main highway, Jefferson  appeared.   One main street, postoffice,  furniture store, a bank and Woolworth's came into  view.   St. Coletta's was five miles down an asphalt road that passed simple country houses,  cows grazing in fields, an occasional barn with  a silo and miles of open space.  Career Testing  and Counseling  283-9329  COUNSELING AND PSYCHOMETRICS  BUTLER UNIVERSITY  4600 SUNSET  INDIANAPOLIS, IN 46208  In front of us, huge yellow brick buildings stood  out like giants.   The main dormitory with two  elongated wings on each side housed the girls. A  large church with a gigantic gold cross loomed into  the sky and cast a shadow on the barren fields.  Shrubs made a fence, tall pines and firs hiding the  panorama from the main road.  At the very top of the hill behind the school  stood a ranch house.   When you inquired about  who lived there, the nuns would give out no  information, but the newspapers and television  were always reporting that Rosemary Kennedy  had been its resident for years.  The school was a four-hundred acre farm that  housed five hundred people, of various ages  and needs.   Those who could benefit from academic studies went to the regular school, while  the others were taught a trade or skills for leisure time  We parked the car in front of the main building.   Jill jumped out with her blue suitcase and  we walked up to the main door.   She pushed the  bell and a buzzer let us into a small entry way.  High above was a circular stair in front of a  double glass door.    She bounced along, bumping the blue suitcase.   I climbed more slowly  tugging a black plaid case and duffle bag.  Morton balanced Marabell in one hand and  manipulated the big red sled in the other.   He  held his head rigid and looked above Jill.   I  kept saying,   I can't cry or she'll cry.    At the top Sister Agnes opened the big glass  doors.   Hello,   she said,  Welcome to St. Coletta's.  May I help you?    Yes, we're the Hosteins from Ohio and you  are expecting Jill.   The staircase appeared larger as we curved  our way to the upper glass door.   Sweat poured  from my hand.    I can't cry because she'll cry.   She seemed too simple and trusting to go away  and leave--all five hundred miles.  Jill clutched her blue suitcase.   Morton stood  rigid, looking nowhere.   He squeezed her hand.  She fitted her fingers between his.   I repeated,   You must be brave.   Do what they want you to.  Then you can learn more.   You can even learn  to read.    Yes,  Mama--I'll be good.   Don't let Brooke  sleep in my room.   Tracy can play with my old doll  and take care of Troubles.  We entered through the glass door into a hallway  covered with an oriental carpet and walked along  to a small private sitting room.   As you entered  you could feel the good-byes and the tears.  According to the plaques on the wall each piece  of furniture had been given to the school.   An antique sofa and two Queen Anne Chairs looked inviting, but we all were standing when Sister Carol  Marie led Jill away.  A Rubens Crucifixion scene hung on the wall.  Morton was looking up above the painting; a tear  slid down his cheek.   As I gazed at the Crucifixion painting,  I asked-- The answer? Please have,  an  answer.

        <pagetext>8.  WOMANKIND  Parents: What are your children doing  in the classroom?  At the age of twenty-eight, I returned to the  high school classroom, this time as a student  teacher.   In college I had been a dedicated  student while working full-time as a bookkeeper  in order to secure the money for my studies which,  in turn,  would allow me to fulfill my goal to  become a high school teacher.   However,  I was  ill-prepared for what I encountered in the classroom.  The school to which I was assigned is located  in a small town near Indianapolis.   It could be  termed, for the most part, upper-middle class,  both socially and economically.    It is a  desirable place  to live.   The houses in the area  are beautiful and expensive.   This is obviously  not an inner-city school for the culturally deprived.  The school has a small, but adequate library,  a school newspaper (which is handled mainly by  the students and a teacher-advisor), a music  department, and an athletic department.   The  administration is truly interested in its students  and its faculty.   To many, it would appear to  be an ideal school structure.   But what goes on  within the classroom?  First of all, the students are apathetic.   Very  few students strive for any understanding of a  subject or for academic excellence.   If the task  or assignment is not easy and on the surface, they  will not spend time on it.   Most are not fully  prepared to contribute in class; many fail to do  assigned homework even if a  surface  assignment.   Most are reluctant to do any work unless  they know a grade will be assigned.   A few refuse to read orally in class, even though their  reading skills are adequate.   Some can not take  a stand or volunteer an opinion and support it  with facts or examples.   Many refused outright  an assignment for the semester: the novels--  Huckleberry Finn and The Scarlet Letter.   They  used the often poorly wTftten CliTr ates to get  them by.  One: day a student informed me in class that  school was  boring.     I then asked the class  to take out a sheet of paper and list, in order of  importance,  the things that did mean the most  to them.     Having fun  was high on the list.   My boyfriend  was often seen.    School fell  near the bottom of the list or,  for over half of  those who responded,  did not appear at all.   One  or two students did mention their families or  their church.    The majority got their point  across: school did not mean much to them.  During class there was die usual constant hum  of talking.   I often had to request each class to  quiet down seven or eight times during the  fifty-five minute period.   I reseated students  because they lacked self-control when they sat  near special friends.   Countless times I found  students doing homework for other classes when  they should have been participating in class  discussions, or at least taking notes.   Each  class contained a few students who loudly wisecracked tlmee or four times a day.   This usually  broke the class into uncontrolled laughter.   I  was often the butt of tiieir jokes.  Conferences and detentions (which were  served after school) were often of no value.   A  word or two to parents often proved of no avail.  One parent told me that she was sorry her son  was such a problem in class and that she wished  she could promise me it wouldn't happen again,  but she couldn't.   She had little influence on  her son, was past trying to discipline him, and  his father lived elsewhere.   His behavior,  after  all, was not any worse than that of her other  son.  Most of my students considered me to be a  hard teacher.   This, I believe, stemmed from  the fact that I gave homework almost every  night.   The fact that there was a lot of material  to be covered (in order for them to do well on  the comprehensive examination at the end of  the semester) didn't matter:   I was too hard.  Their daily complaints that the work load was  too heavy made me reconsider their assignments.  Most of the selections in the literature book were  only a few pages in length; some, such as poems,  were only a page or less in length.   In the   time  wasted complaining,  their homework could have  been done.   But what if I was a bit  hard?   These students (they were in their junior year  of high school) still wrote in fragments.   They  couldn't distinguish the difference  between   there, their, and they're.    They had to ask  the meanings of words such as  imperative  or  by JOSIE LAWRENCE   crucial.    A paragraph, to some, consisted of  two sentences.   An essay was three.  Another factor to consider regarding homework was the fact that students at the junior  and senior level were not required to sign up  for study halls.   Some students left school at  noon.   The majority of my students worked--  sometimes eight hours after they departed from  school.   Some went to work later in the day,  and didn't arrive home until 11:00 or 12:00 at  night.   The first period morning class began  at 7:1-5.    To offset lack of study time outside  of school,  I occasionally gave ten or fifteen  minutes at the end of the period to allow them  to at least begin their homework.    This  study  time  usually ended up as  chat time  for the  students.   Few began their homework and those  who actually did could seldom concentrate.  Most of the students wanted to pass, but  some were content with the grade of D-.   This  enabled them to continue in extracurricular  activities--cheerleading,  wrestling,  basketball, etc.   When students had been lax during  the grading period (three six-weeks in a semester), they appealed to me to assign  extra  credit.     After little real effort during the  grading period, they felt the  extra credit   would bail them out.   I always permitted it,  but it was often too little, too late.   For extra  credit, I often gave a writing assignment.   This  they whipped together with little real effort,  as evidenced from the content and form.   If  asked how long it took to complete the extra  work, ten minutes was often the reply.  Because I was a student teacher, the students  realized my position was not a permanent one.  As a result I was often the subject of belligerent,  sarcastic, and rude remarks.   Choice comments  included:  Shut up,    I'm tired of looking at  your ugly face,    You're a bitch.    But the  one that made me cringe the most was  Whoever told you that you knew how to teach?   Since my student teaching experience,  my  ideas regarding education have changed considerably.   Before,  I felt that any really good  teacher could motivate her students to learn.  In some situations,  I find this is an impossibility.  The good teachers in the building really knocked  themselves out preparing for a class in which  most students would be too disinterested or too  preoccupied to pay attention,  no matter how  clever the teacher had been in making her  material inviting.    Even varied and unique  approaches do not get to some students.   Daily  I heard this in the teacher's lounge, but I  didn't believe it until my supervising teacher  actually turned the class over to me.  It is apparent,  then,  that things have changed  and will probably continue to do so.    According  to Albert R. Munse,  Educational Program Officer  for the Department of Health, Education and  Welfare, the estimates of the mean years of  service for individuals in the teaching profession  decrease one year for every school year.  Ask any college professor with several years  service and she or he will probably state that  the writing skills of incoming freshmen decrease  in quality each year.   Annually,  the national  average of the SAT scores declines.   Nearly half  of an entering fresbman class at the college  level will not return their sophomore year.    Why?  Aren't the high schools teaching as well as they  did in the past?  I volunteer no solutions to these problems;  indeed, that is not what I intended to do.   But  many parents, dismayed with the low marks  their sons and daughters bring home, may wish  to probe further than the teachers, the building,  the school administration, or the town.  The possible reason for low or failing grades  may come from mat unique source: the student.  Who'sB.O.S.S.?

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  Volumes   of   Dreams  by  J. C.   STARKER  I have always loved  books, respected them  as if they were old  friends I'd gone to  visit. But I don't remember learning to  read. My mother made  the transition so easy  for me that I cannot  recall a struggle in  learning how to rec-  ognizethe written word.  tdl  :   rj       illusgAgy    ftTARZAjj   She was born in Kentucky and was raised  in the black dust that consumed the small  coal camps in the southeastern part of that  state. Her family life consisted of surviving at the poverty level. Food had to be  planted and harvested. Coal for the fireplace and water from the well had to be  carried in every day. There were many heavy  loads for a small, skinny girl who dreamed  of far-off places and exciting people. But  very early in her life she discovered something that let her travel past the invisible  gate that locked her into the mountains, she  learned to read. The books she had available were few. She borrowed or begged or  read labels from cans and flour sacks. The  Bible was the only book most of the people  of the coal camps owned. It wasn't until  she was married with children of her own  that trips to the public library were within  her reach.  Some of my earliest memories are of that  young girl-grown up   with her three daughters trailing behind her as she walked up the  steps into a small library in southern Indiana. There was always a hush to the ceremony of entering the huge doors as though  we were being taken into some great wonderland. Remembering, I know I felt like Alice  stepping over into that new world where no  one had gone before her.  A smell of paper, aged with use, always  made that entrance new. My mother would  turn and place her finger up to her lips and  smile as though we four were sharing some  great secret together.   Once she told lis that  MARVELLABAYH  February 14, 1933 - April 24, 1979  A courageous feminist  one of God's greatest gifts to her had  been the freedom to explore all those pages  written about life. We were taught not to  accept that gift lightly.  The library we visited was filled with  old volumes of thick novels with faded  lettering and yellowed pages. And the floor  was shiny dark wood that creaked when I  walked from one shelf to the next, eager to  find everything, to know everything, to read  it all. I would walk on tiptoes, trying to  keep the floor at peace as I wont searching.  There were wide wooden tables, with  heavy legs so strong and sturdy that they  did not heed the bumping of a ten-year-  old's brown oxfords as she sat down to  read. One summer I travelled over half the  world sitting at those tables. The follow: ig  year I went to Africa with Tarzan and then  Burroughs took me on to the moon. I cried  with Jane Eyre and fell in love with Jo's  professor soon afterwards. All the while  my mother encouraged my travelling, know  of my sorrow, and smiled at my first encounter with love.  As the years have passed, so have the  books through my hands and into my memory.  I grow older and learn new secrets held upon  the shelves in narrow aisles. The buildings  change; I sit at smaller tablos; and, I read  books that did not exist when I was a child.  But what has not changed through all these  years is the familiar hush that welcomes me,  that invites me to come in, and offers me a  freedom that has been unsurpassed by my  adult status. I am compelled by habit, by  memory, and by desire to visit old friends  and make new ones.  The girl from Kentucky? She now leads  her grandchildren through those huge doors,  and I follow, watching her smile as she  turns to let us know there are secrets  waiting for us to share.

        <pagetext>10.  WOMANKIND  BOARD  Housewife Hostility  I had what most women dread and fear... a late  baby.   Looking back,  may I say, the pros have  much outweighed the cons.   For instance, the love  that each member of the family feels for him and  our enjoyment of his every antic and achievement  has tightened our family circle and given us a wonderful feeling of togetherness.  But the idea of a baby arriving, unplanned,  later in life, when the other three kids were well  on their way to maturity and all infant equipment  had been sold at garage sales years ago,  DID take  some getting used to.     I remember the initial  shock that the discovery of the conception brought. . .   You gotta be kidding   My voice sounded hollow.  The doctor shook his head, smiled and told me I  could get dressed.   My actions seemed mechanical and unreal, my thoughts were confused, my  hands uncoordinated, like everything was going in  slow motion.  A few minutes later, still bewildered, I was  wandering around the parking lot, clutching the  prescription for pre-natal vitamins in my hand.  Finally managing to locate the car, I sat behind  the wheel with my mouth open and my eyes  vacant.  The numbness began to wear off as the news  sank in.   Good grief    I'm pregnant    I'm actually with child this very moment.    There's  a baby growing in me    You gotta be kidding   my husband gasped,  his eyes bugging, his mouth hanging open.  After  a few seconds of stunned silence, he breathed,   Do you realize that kid will graduate from college only one year before I retire?   By PAT HEIDENREICH   Not only that,   I muttered,   now I'll never  get the ironing caught up.     So what?  You know the kids outgrew the ironing years ago     That's sure a rotten thing to say   I sniffed.  We sat down in a daze and thought about  bottles, diapers,  cribs, little toys all over the  floor,  baby food, buggies,  formula, bibs,  baby  asprin, strollers,  rattles,  car-seats,  a nursery,  bathinettes,  burping, hichairs,  playpens, little  spoons, baby powder,  size 0 undershirts that tie,  two o'clock feedings,  family camping vacations,  insurance,  inoculations,  pablum,  doctor's appointments, kindergarten. . . we were overwhelmed.   Gos,  Mom,  you gotta be kidding   the kids  chomsed,  while staring dubiously at my mid-section.   Can I feel the baby kick?    Not yet, dear.     Mom, do you realize that when I'm a freshman  in college,  the baby will be just starting Nursery  school?    Godfrey    You're just like your father,   I  shuddered.  The youngest started to enumerate his plans.   I'm gonna teach him to play baseball, roller  skate, ride a bike,  fish, shoot a B-B gun. ..     What if it's a girl?  I interrupted.  The boys frowned.  My daughter smiled.  ... But the final blow of the discovery came a  week later.   My husband and I were reluctantly on  our way to a P. T. A. meeting when I said,   Do  you realize we have twenty-four more straight  years of P.T. A. meetings?   He nearly went off the road.

Who ever thinks of a  housewife as hostile?   That tender woman watching  over her children,  taking meticulous care of her  house, gardening in the yard; now how can that be  hostile?   It's  not -- unless you happen to be a  housewife who isn't really a housewife, like the  woman who is working toward finishing that college  degree she didn't get when she decided to get  married.  The returning woman with such weird aims as  actually going to work out there in the real world  can really be in for it.  Now you are probably a bit skeptical about all  this.    After all,  it could be that the woman in  question is suffering from an acute case of paranoia.  If she's being subtly ostracized,  it's probably her  own fault for not having time to kill three hours  drinking tea with the girls each Tuesday morning,  or not being able to attend exercise class three  mornings a week (mindful that running all over  campus and up and down flights of stairs is plenty  of exercise).  Every now and then she feels a little guilty about  neglecting her housewife friends and so she'll  telephone and listen dutifully for  45 minutes  about her friend's latest exciting loss of weight at  a   weightwatchers' club or about the new clothes  her friend purchased,  and finally the friend will  ask,   Well, how are things with you?   At last a chance to tell someone about all the  interesting people and all the fascinating things  on campus    Maybe she misjudged her friend.  She begins to tell her of the opportunities she's  found,  feeling relieved that her friend understands.  Then,quite abruptly,  the friend has pressing  housework to do and no longer has time to talk.  The student-housewife  hangs up the phone  gently.    Housewife hostility is a reality.

        <pagetext>WOMANKIND  11  Under The Influence of the Family  PASSIVITY continued from p. 3  by SANDY BOONE  She could only afford two classes,  but even  that didn't matter.   Neither her sister nor her  brother had ever gone to college, and no one,  absolutely no one,  at the college had ever heard  of her,  or any one in her family, before.   It  would be the answer of a secret fantasy to do  something,  just once,  that would be all her own.  Up to now,  the only thing outstanding about  her had been her green eyes,  and even then,  they always told her that her sister's were greener.  She would now venture out, stand behind her  married name,  and be as incognito as Paul  Newman in brown contacts.   It wasn't that she  didn't love them all;  it was just a need in her  to do something that wasn't a repeat of an  accomplishment her sister had already outgrown  and finished.  To be someplace where no one would know  that she treated her brother so badly.    At times  her mother had told her,  He will hate you when  he grows up.     (This was a phrase that she never  outgrew.   When she named her second child and  only son Roman, her mother made the same  statement.)  So it was, when she finally enrolled  in college at 27,  with her husband's blessing, she  felt for the first time like a butterfly let out of  the cocoon.   She was Kathy and,  for all anyone  knew or cared, she came and went from nowhere.  She loved the peace and quiet of the campus,  the thirty-mile drive each way,  the studying,  the reading,  the writing, and even the tests.  With enthusiasm she entered a writing contest  being sponsored by an association of women and  men committed to the furthering of the arts.    She  entered to have a term project for her creative  writing course.    Somehow,  winning the first  place prize of  2, 000 never entered her mind  until they called to tell her and offer congratulations.    Her family was ecstatic and began  notifying every relative in the continental United  States.    Her husband was proud,  her kids were as  pleased as if she'd made PTA president,  and the  school put her on a local TV talk show with a  much younger student heading for Oxford on a  scholarship.  The TV host was friendly,  if bemused; the  student remarked that it was sometimes better  to have a bit of maturity before starting one's  college education,  making her feel like Whistler's  mother;  and the whole taping taught her a new  meaning of the word  fear.     She tried to be  sporting about the family gathering to see her  Saturday morning TV debut,  but she would have  preferred they all watch Scooby-Doo.    It was like  a special secret had been made public, and she  began to be glad she had never kept a diary.  When she was invited to lunch with one of  the judges and the lady who had chaired the  contest, she felt obligated to go.   Now,   she thought,  driving up to the large  Tudor hall that housed the dining facilities of  the much larger campus where her two luncheon  companions were to be,    now, you know why  a butterfly quivers so when it lights.    A cocoon  may be confining,  but at least it's safe.    country  5p   harmony  tropical plants,  decorative accessories  garden center fir nursery  complete landscaping service  6025 w. 10th       247-8661  1 block east of I-465  The lady was Dr. Renelda Burke.   She was  past her eightieth year and leaned heavily on a  walking stick.   Taller than Kathy, and large  boned, she wore a plain purple dress, and an  ancient straw hat dotted with weak straw flowers,  and an occasional small hole.   Her face, strong,  but kind,  was framed by soft white hair done in  waves and a French roll.    A ragged red ribbon  tied through a hole in her cane kept Kathy wondering off and on all through lunch what its  significance might be.  The judge was Dr. Foster,  and he immediately  put Kathy at her ease.    Slightly built and beginning to gray,  he was both kind and interesting.  If he had heard that lapels had been widened or  small bow ties outdated in the past twenty years,  his outfit didn't betray him.    Kathy wondered  which pocket his pipe might he in.    She had  already noticed the imposing wall of stained  glass windows in the beautiful sedate dining room,  and the large number of people milling easily  about.    When asked if she preferred the buffet  or the menu, she opted for the menu to keep from  looking out of place and awkward.  Dr. Foster seemed interested in the background  of a housewife-student winner,  but Dr. Burke had  lived a long and adventuresome life and every  statement prompted a new story from the woman's  past.  When Tr. Burke would finish a story about her  visits to Africa and the Far East, or her fifty  years in the same house on campus,  Dr. Foster  would again turn to Kathy with a gently probing  question into her much shorter past.   Answering  the questions made her feel like a fraud,  until  she admitted the part her upbringing had played  in her writing and in entering the contest.    It was  her mother who had encouraged her to further her  writing skills,  with special courses as far back as  junior high,  and she had researched her essay by  using her father's library.    If she was building a  new future,  it still lay on her childhood foundation and always would.  When she left that day,  Dr. Burke leaned on  her cane and said,  We will all be waiting to hear  from you in the future.    The remark made Kathy feel uncomfortable,  and for awhile she wondered if she was now obliged  to succeed--or disappoint this fine woman.    When  she confided her fears to her husband, he said  simply,  Why do you insist on intimidating  yourself? It's your fault, not the other guy's.  She was complimenting you.    She wondered what he meant.  One spring day she raised the windows and  stood watching the budding trees.   The air  smelled of greenness and a possible rain.    She  thought:  There have been a million,  billion  blossoming springs,  and yet this one is not the  least bit worried about disappointing the past  or failing the future in its grace and beauty.    In her notebook she wrote,   Growing up is  learning not to intimidate yourself with ghosties  and ghoulies and things that go bunp in the night  ... or your older sister. ... baby brother old  professors....

David Shane     2510460  The anti-nuke movement has been hampered by  its  hippie  lifestyle image which sometimes comes  across as simply anti-technological.    And its sensible calls for solar or wind power are ridiculed by   experts  who fail to mention that relatively speaking the research done on these forms has produced  as much in the way of reliable energy source potential as that lavished upon nuclear.  Perhaps  most  basically,  the passivity   I've described may be related not just to a lack of specific alternatives,  but to the lack of an alternative  vision   a sense of how a complicated modern industrial society can fulfill people's material and  spiritual needs.   A vision of how people can regain a sense of control over their lives, their environment and their technology.  Ultimately, the people must demonstrate that  it is possible to insure jobs and a decent standard  of living for Americans without the exploitation  of the rest of the world,  the destruction of our  environment, or the risking of our children's  future.   in These Times    Roberta Lynch is a  national officer of the New American Movement.

The phone was ringing as people bustled about  carrying empty boxes to be filled.   Empty egg  cartons and art supplies were stacked in the  corner ready to go.    Drifting conversation wrapped its way around walls,  now stripped of almost  all their attire.   Are you happy 'Stacer'?   Yes.

'        * gt; lt;/  I just saw my first issue of WOMANKIND at the office of Westchester Woman, where I am on the staff. We do  not publish poetry, but since you seem  to welcome it, I have enclosed a few  poems you may be able to use. If you  want to restrict contributions to those  from the Midwest,  though,  I will understand.  (Editors note: All women writers  welcome from everywhere )  Actually, it would be better for me  anyway to have poetry appear outside  my immediate region.   It's hard  enough to keep being told,    Ob ,  you write?  without also being told,   Oh, you write poetry?     On a different subject   we may try  to get together a loose organization  of independent women's journals for  exchanging support and information.  In this area three papers just folded  that might have survived had they  had the kind of support such an organization could offer.   Our editor,  Jody Israel, remembers that women's  presses were trying to organize a  couple of years ago in the Midwest.    Do you know if anything  came of it?   Would you be interested in belonging to an organization like that?  Best wishes,  Sally Darnowsky  Peekskill, N.Y.  Since I had one poem in the IUPUI  student anthology (Genesis,  Fall,  1978) I  am now able to relate to myself somewhat  as  the author.    But I am still shy to come  out as the very complex, polymorphous  perverse individual woman who has lived  in many different lifestyles and whose  poetry seems to almost grow of its own  accord out of moments of intense emotion  in all of my earlier choices.    Looking  back over it to choose what to submit  even to a sister publication is frightening.  The Army (my husband) brought us to  Indianapolis (from Oklahoma) in May,  1978,  and I am still trying to make connections to feminist groups and people in  ways that make sense to me.  I was very glad,   in spite of my jitters,  of your solicitation of manuscripts.    Hope  that these (poems) mean something to  some other women,  too.  Jenny Lee-Park  Indianapolis, IN.  I have enclosed a check for  5. 00 to  subscribe to WOMANKIND.    Please  send my first copy right away as I am  anxious to receive such a quality publication .

It  was  published in December.  In my spare time, I have been  compiling my own feminist poetry  in hopes of publishing it.  I wo uld appreciate any information you could forward to me about  your publishing consultation offer.  Sincerely,  Sandra Kay Hausfeld  Akron,  Ohio  Thank you so much for sending me some  of the WOMANKIND poetry.    And I enjoyed the issue I bought tremendously     well written and full of exciting news for  women.    I'm glad you were up in South  Bend and I found out about it.  Enclosed is  5. 00 for a subscription  and a few of my poems which I hope you  can use.  Sincerely,  Joan Mcintosh  South Bend, IN.  I want to thank you for your sharing  of resources with people on our campus. The display provided for our recent program on women's studies was  exciting to all of us.   I am very  happy about the fine work you are  doing for women in Indianapolis and  the surrounding area.   Best wishes as  you continue your important work.
